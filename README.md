# Money, Trust and Central Bank Communication
### Data and Scripts PhD Nanterre University  

This dissertation examines the role of monetary trust in monetary theory and policy and its implications for an empirical study on central bank communications. The first part critically examines the role monetary trust has played in economic theory in order to distinguish between two schools of thought. In the first school, monetary trust is defined as a horizontal relation between individuals, an approach to monetary trust that was developed by the neoclassical tradition and that continues to influence monetary theory and policy to this day. In the second approach, monetary trust is viewed from a vertical perspective, focusing on the institutional context and social embeddedness of trust relationships. The conclusion that monetary trust is fundamentally hierarchical drawn from this analysis, motivates the empirical study of the second part. This part analyzes whether German and French central bankers are able to efficiently manage the communicative challenge of pandering to the different demands of their three distinct target audiences—the markets, the state, and the public at large. 

The empirical methodology for this analysis builds on the growing literature analyzing central bank communications to better understand the political and financial implications of monetary policy. I hope to contribute to this field of research by 1) creating a new database of 21 years of speeches and interviews of the Banque de France, the Bundesbank and the ECB (1999-2019), 2) devising a new method for analyzing communications that takes into account different audiences and 3) providing empirical evidence for the observation that monetary policy is not neutral, i.e., that communications are biased in favor of some economic groups over others. The results of this analysis show that French and German central bankers communicate differently at home and at the European level, and deliver a preliminary confirmation of the hypothesis that central bank communications distinguish between audience groups according to the hypothesized hierarchical taxonomy. 

For the purpose of this study, I collected 21 years of public documents from the German Bundesbank, the Banque de France, and the European Central Bank (1999-2019). The data and codes for the econometric analysis can be found in the folders below.
