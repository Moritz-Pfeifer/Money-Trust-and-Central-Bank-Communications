Th: euro <U+FFFD> bom and th<U+FFFD>. irreversible nature of this change hasnvinced an mcreasmg number of political and economic actors that the 5111ccess:<U+FFFD> the euro is a. necessity for E<U+FFFD>op<U+FFFD>. lt is a keystone of thc European single rnarket which will ensure prospenty tn Europe. It is clear tbat, now and for the future, we havc to face a numbcr of challenses to make this success sustamable. I would like today to draw yourattention particularly to the following two issues First, the euro area will have to face up to a number of challenges to confumits initial success (I); Second, the success of the euro will make a major contribution towards encouraging a more balanced international monetary situation (ll). 1/ THE SUCCESS OF TBE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A NUMBER OF CUALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP A few years ago. it was necessary to convince a great number of skepti.c people, in Europe but, especially, here in the US, that the euro ... vas a viable proj ect. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions and its alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix 'ithout a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some 11a.'i)'Il1IIletric shocks"" (that is to say difficulti.es occurring in a Member economy and not in others ); the lack of sufficient flexibility of the economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries, etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never ex.ist! Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are usefül to help answer the guestion of what are the conditions for ensuring that the ew:o is a complete success. I see four conditions: -Tbe flrst condition is the creclibility of monetary policy guaranteed bv theW.dependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national central bank. Tue euro is a credible currency and it must anä will carefully keep and consolidate the confidence of the 290 million Europeans in the euro area and tb.e confidence of non-Emopeans with wbom we do business. Th.is can only be en.smed by res;sting any kind of pressure on how the new currency is managed. Satisfying tbis first condition will be facilitated, by the hannonious functioning of the European monetaxy tearn, which iscomposed of the ECB and the elcven national central banks of the Euro area.-The second coodition is compliaoce with the provisions of the Treaty and theguidelines l<U+FFFD>d <U+FFFD>own <U+FFFD> the Stabil<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> and Oro<U+FFFD> Pact with regard to nscal policy.Close coordination ot fiscal polic1es and Vlgilant peer surveillancc within theinformal council of the cleven. participating member states - tb.c so-called ""EuroEleven""· and by the m.inisters offinancc ofthe 15 Member States convencd in theEcofin CoUI1cil is essential to ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the eurozoue.Adherence to the medium-term objecti.ve of achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus"" -meaning nobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit - is indispensable for the union as a whole to wcather periods of economic difficulty and for individual cowitries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. We have to understand that monetarv policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overa.11 lcvel of the Economic and MonetarY Union. For my Part. I would give three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. -By coordinatingthe fiscal policies ofthe Member Sta-tes ofMonetmyUDion, thepact ensures a good policy roix within the euro area This is essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the national budgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This calls for close mutual surveHJance and coordmation of :fiscal policies within the area. - Tue pact helps prevent well-run economies :from having to bear unjustified riskpremia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - The stability pact aUows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has noautomatic sta.bilizers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscal posi tion of close to balance or inSlll'plus in the medimn term, the pact enables them to let fiscal de:ficits increase during recessions without cxceeding 'the 3% reference valuc. In short, it allows thcm to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periodc_; that can be drawn on, if an asymmctric shock occurs. -The third condition is tbat all European countries must resolutely undertakestructural reforms. Conti:nental Europe is experiencing high levels of lillctnployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining slightly in most of its economies. Accordingto thc IMF and the OECD, around 80% oftbis miemployment is structt.u""al, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis. Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe its focus onth euro mstead of what they considercd the more urgent task of implementing the;ctural reforms necessary for more dynamic job creation. These critics were wrong · regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assesSI11ent ofthe problcms oftb.e European economy is obviously correct. Tue eurowill complement, rather than detract from, structural rcfonns. Most importantly, a smgle clß'ency will ease the tlow of goods, services and capital within the eurozone. ,And the euro will also encourage ""cross fertilization"" of best practices through stronger coordination of member states policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, work and job creation inccntives, effective welfare safety nets, etc . .In this sense, th.e euro-which is in itself a major structural reform-rnust, and will certainlY, bring about other structural reforms. -The fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must beclearsighted with regard to the crucial qucstion of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy rneant in particular monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and tb.e foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Govemments thus received constant and to a large extent real time feedback on key inclicators affecting national economic pcrformance and could react accordingly. These indicators remain on the euro-wide level: this is why the coordination offiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. But thcy have disappeared at the national level with the advent of the euro, whilst the rules of a market cconomy continue to apply to each economy participating in the Euro zone. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services tbey feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various coun1ries accorcling to the relative competitiveness of these locations. Therefore the leaders of each national economy mu.st monitor competitiveness through indicators of competitiveness such as unit production costs, the ta.x and rcgulatory framework and so forth. This is even rnore importänt than before. Now contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competiti.veness will not; show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal account s, foreign exchange markets and interest rates markets, so policy·makers must be even more vigilant in watching other indicators. Tue sanctions for economic policy errors might come morc slowly end insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. Before tuming to the role of tb.e euro in tb.e jntemational monetary system, let <U+FFFD>e just stress tbat these conditions are at the heart of the ESCB message to other European a.uthorities. As a matter of fact. when we decided, on April the 8th, to lowerthe ECB's key interest rates by SO basis points, to 2,5%, we stressed that this decision was based on a longer term. stability-orientcd course and we invited those responsible for othcr policy areas to take the necessary steps to improve longer-term growth prospects for thc euro area 1hrough decisively adhering to the aims of the Stability -5-and Growth Pact and through embarking on convincing structural refonns in theeconomy. W THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL VIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETIJRECONOMIC AND MONET ARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD.In the cuuent <iverall economic situation, the success ofthe euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from Europeai1 prosperity and growth as part of a healthy world economy. Clearly, tbe new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequenccs not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. The Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through tbe developmcnt ofbalanced economic relationships inside the euro area and ,;ivith the countries outside the European Union, and through the reinforcement of international financial and monetary stability. A. EMU will bclp to set balanced economic rclationships.a). Tbe relationsbip bctween mooetary union and the otber European colllltries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of tbe European Coinmunity is required by the Treaty and is necessary for the European Union to function propcrly at the economic level. It is important tbat the dialogue between all EU countries continue.s, even though the cbangeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. Inparticu1ar, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the coun1ries that have not yct joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area The new excllange-rate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concerned (tbis is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1st J 999) will play its part in tbis process. By promoting exchange­rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will belp the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. b), ne Monetary Union will also have close relationsbips with countrics outside the European Union. First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for our neighbours from c·entra1 Europe. The results achieved by some of thcm during the last year.s show remarkable improvcments. They must keep on -6-makin& an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is in theirown interest and in the interest of cUll'Cirt EU member states,With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustaioable economic growth for so<U+FFFD>e290 million inhabitants, and it will definitely play its important part in the intcmational commwüty. The euro will malce the international policy cooperationproccss easier amo<U+FFFD>g <U+FFFD>e m<U+FFFD> fartners • the United States, Japan, and the Euroarca. Each ofthem Js m a pos1tion to speak on behalf of a !arge ecooomic area. Moreover, each partner is vuln<U+FFFD>rable to a rather similar degree to adverse shoc.Jcs occurring in the international financial system. Therefore the euro should induce a balanced relationshlp in which each partner will take on responsibility for contn'buting to a stable global environment. This major institutional change in the architecture of the international monetary system has made it necessary, to settle the issue of the international representation ofthe ESCB. c). lntemational representation ofthe ESCB As a result of tbe association of the National Central Banks which compose it, the ESCB en joys very close bilateral relations with other CentralBanlcs in the world and is already represented in international institutions andfora. Some decisions are still under consideration, but agreements have becn reached on the main practical arrangements, for ESCB representation. with the Intemati.onal Monetary Fund (IMF) which has granted an observer status to the ECB -, the Baclc for lritemational Settlements (BIS), the Organisation für Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) andin the G-7 and G-10 context. B .EMU will reinforce monetary and fmanciaJ stability a). The international role ofthe euro. With regard to the international role of the euro, let me say that the ESCB takes a neutral stance. The international role of a currency is a complex matter. A currency cao be used by different groups of cconomic agents for different pUipOses, as an anchor and reserve currency on the official side, ancl, as an invoicing and payment currency for international trade, as weil as currency of denomination for financial assets, on the private side. At any rate, it will .?11ce time for the euro to develop its rote as an international currency in its various functions. -7-1 ' As far as thc future share of the euro in thc overall official reserves is concemed, it may be expected that cen1ral banks of non-elll'O area countries will prosn:ssiv:lY reassess . f:beir reserve m_anagement stratcgy according to the diversi:fication opporturutics offered by this new currcncy. Besides, the euro might play a greater role as an anchor cunency for other European countries which intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro. & far as the private use of ßi<U+FFFD> euro is concemed, economic agcnts may use euro to hedge tbeir risks through portfolio diversification. If international mvestors and borrowers consider <U+FFFD> tbc euro will remain a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimize the risks in their intemationally divcrsified portfolios. Moreover a broad and liquid euro financial market will progressively Iead to a widespread usc of the euro, which, in turn, would facilitatc its development as a currency for trade and commodity pricing. Toe euro will progressively develop, over time, as an jnternational cU1TeDcy widely used by the private sector, although the pace of intemationalisation may vary dcpending on the :function. b) The exchange rate relationships of the euro area vis a vis key gJobalcurrencies.As regards the exchange r;tte relationslrips of thc Euro vis a vis other n1ajor global currencies, namely tlie Dollar aod the Yen, I think that one shou:ld never forget the following : . in a floating exchange system the stability of the exchange rate depends on fundamentals. Therefore sound and wise policies in tbe monetary and in tbe fiscal arcas are the best recipe for an cmpropriate functioning of the international monetary system. From that standpoint, it is encouraging to note that on both sides of the Atl<U+FFFD>c we share the same overall concept of a cUIICncy which keeps its value ovcr time and a budget aimed at being close to balance or in surplus. 1 On top of sowid fundamentals, wbich are decisive, we need to pursue and reinforce international cooperation. This cooperation has proved useful during the last fifteen years. Taking stock of thc experience and lcssons of the last years, this international co•operation can probably be improved further; and the fact that thrce currencies of the 07 cotintrics bave now merged in the euro could and 1 1 ' • should inake this co--operation easicr, and more and morc effect1ve. In tbis perspective I would! like to draw yom attention to tbree principles, which are key for international. <U+FFFD>operation to be efficient i • tb.e fin.1 principle we all have to stick to is the r<U+FFFD>:::pect of the noti<U+FFFD>n thatthe fundamentals are conmiandiBg the evolution of the exchange rates m the medium and long term. --8-1 /. 11 1the second principle is the necessitv to work out a cJear consensus ainong all psrtners concerned, namely the executive branches and independentmonetazy authorities of the various monetarv areas concemed.- !he third princjple is the Jesp<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>t of wbat I would call verbal discipline.ML_'ll'kets can be troubled by risky. h<U+FFFD>terogeneous or contradictory statements. On <U+FFFD>. contrary they are impressed by the cohesion and coherence of statements <U+FFFD>ticldng to joint '<U+FFFD>enns ofreferepc<U+FFFD>"". * ! 1 •; . 1 ' 1 In conclusion, Jet me stress tbree ppfuts: Aß regards the European <U+FFFD>entral Bank and the European System of Central Banks, I would like to suggest a met.aphor which might be of help to illustrate our views. There is a morietary team of Europe. composed of twelve players, the ECB and the · 11· National Central Banks. lt is tbis füll. twelve­member monetary team whlch is piaying on the field, with a single team spi,tit and this team spirit is one of the pmceless assets ofEurope. ' 1 Secondly, the intematiOllal Joncertation in tbe framework, inter alia, of the 07, has brought further progress/ in strengthenuig the international financial architecture. There is sometimes to<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>uch emphasis being put, m my view, on the different feelings or positions, tha<U+FFFD> appear here and there. What l think is more important is the fact that the international community fully agrees on many key issues. Let me just mention tbe thbcs on which we agreed: tbe importance of principles of ""good practice""· in/ the field of social policy, the reinforced supervision of Highly Leveraged In'stitutions (incJuding hedge fimds), tbe creation of tb.e Financial Stability Forum) the organisation of two seminars with the ernerging countries in March and .A.pril, the organization of a preparatorv meeting ofthe Interim Committee ... · 1 . I would lilce 1D sttcss ·J.. Jirit in particular, the spccüic dangen thal areassociated with the ""herd instmct"" of operators, investors and marlcets. This ""herd behaviour"" has been observed:ciuribg the last 18 months both as rcgards investors' attitudes vis a vis cmerging e&,notrues in transition and ccrtainly also as regards markets of the industrialise,fcbuntries themselves. The ""herd instinct"" might be one of the worst enemies wh<U+FFFD> wJ are aimipg at global financial stability. In myopinion, one of the best rebipes for countering that herd behaviom is füll transparency of each partic'ular leotity. of each particular country. of each particular borrower, of eaeh paiticular signature. Only füll and reliable trans.parency for all, both pUblicl ahd private-sector entities, permits a proper iudgement of the merits of eäch case.f 1 1 1 ' 1 : .. 1 ! ' 1 Tblrdly, as regards our p4 moxiota,y policy, I would like to stre•• tha; we are pursuing a strategy of a soll<U+FFFD> and stable euro, a euro which would inspire confidence. I would also like to sttess that tbe euro has clearly a potential for apprcciation. Y{c will ncver forget that we are responsible for the confidence in thc etlro of all savers in Europe and in the r<U+FFFD>st of the world. lt is because savers trust us that wc can have low, medium and/Iong-term market interest rates. To swn yp. i! is by inspirlng confidence to savers that we can improve confidence in the constituencies of entrepreneurs, ecJnomic agents and borrowers in general. Confidence in the euro is oL most precfous good.","jean-claude trichet",""

The euro was bom and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of political and economic actors that the success of the ew-o is a necessity for Europe. lt is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. 11, ..,. It is clear that, now and for the future, we have to face a number of challenges to make this success sustainable. I would like today to draw your attention particularly to the following two issues ¦ First, the Europeans have to meet certain conditions for the euro tobe a full success; ¦ Second, the euro will make an important contribution towardsencouraging a balanced international monetary situation. •"""" •""sEP<U+FFFD>2s-1999 10:07 P.03<U+FFFD>43 ' II THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A Nl]MBER OF CHALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP The successful introduction of the euro is, in itself, a major refonn. But it will be fruitful only if a. certain number of conditions are met, above and beyond monetary policy, in particular regarding structural reforms. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptical people, in Europe but, especially, herein the US, that the euro was a viable "" project. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions, and i<U+FFFD>s alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix without a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some ""asymetric shocks"" (th.at is to say difficulties occurring in a Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility ofthe economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc .. , The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! (<U+FFFD> Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are useful to help answer th.e question of what are the conditions for ensuring that the euro is a complete success. I see four ca_nditions:-The first condition is the credibility of monetaQ:'. policy guaranteed by theindependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in theMaastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national centralbank. If the euro is to be a credible currency, it must win the con.fidence ofthe 290 million Europeans in the euro area and also the confidence of non-. .

This can only be ensured by resisting any kind of pressure, including political, on how the new currency is managed. The necessary dialogue between monetary policy officials and economic policy officials must tak.e the independence of the ESCB into account and also the objective of price stability which, according to the Treaty, must guide the rnonetary policy of the euro area. The respect for the independence of the monetary policy is a condition for the success of the "" euro, in particular in the framework of the ''Cologne <U+FFFD>rocess""­macroeconomic dialogue for the implementation of !he employment Pact­adopted at the last European Council. r. Satisfying this first conclition related to the credibility and the independence ofthe monetary policy, will be facilitated by the harmonious functioning of the European monetary team, which is composed of the ECB and the national central banks from the eleven founding countries. -The second condition is compliance with the provisions of the Treaty andthe guidelines laid down in the Sta<U+FFFD>ility and Growth Pact with regard tofiscal policy. Close coordination of fiscal policies and vigilant peersurveillance within the informal council of the eleven participating memberstates - the ""Euro Eleven Club""- and by the ministers of finance of the 15Member States convened in the Ecofin Council is essential to ensure abalanced policy mix throughout the eurozone. The medium-term objectiveof achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus"" -meansnobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit. To comply with this objective isregu. de - - -Fa>< gu. ae • ._ .. c.,· .., . .,,,-.d 1<U+FFFD>:5z J:'g: 6/.L·a- i- 1<U+FFFD>, .•. ._. .Jt' :r:1 .J.;:) • ;:)G, C!:J · =>,.- .L<U+FFFD>.l ., p_O,F;/1,.d ,-a>< re5EP-2s-1999 10: 08 • 5 indispensable for the union as a whole to weather periods of economic difficulty an.d for individual countries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. lt is the adhesion of all the European governments to the Stability and Growth Pact that allowed the nationai central banks, and the GovemingCouncil of the ECB to decide, last April, to lower the ECB's key interest rates from 3% to 2.5%, in order to provide the euro area with extremely favourable monetary conditions . We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic an.d Monetary Union. For my part, I would give tbree economic justi:fications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. - First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of MonetaryUnion, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the euro area. This is(' essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significantfederal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the nationalbudgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This callsfor close mutual surveillance and coordination of fiscal policies within thearea.' P.05/i4·1 u de: fai< ""8§EP_29-1999 10: 09g: bl .1.·a P.06/14' e _ Then, the pact helps prevent well-run economies from having to bear unjustified risk premia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - Finally, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euroarea has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to amember economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscalposition of close to balance or in surplus in the medium term, the pactenables them to let :fiscal deficits increase during recessions without<U+FFFD> exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to creat<U+FFFD> a :fiscalbuffer during nonnal economic periods that can be drawn on, if anasymetric sbock occurs.-The third condition is that all European countries must resolutelyundertake structural reforms. Continental Europe is experiencing too highlevels of unemployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has beendeclining slightly in most of its econo.mies. According to the IMF and theOECD, around 80% ofthis unemployment is structural, that is, generated byour own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis.Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe to focus its efforts and political energy on the euro, instead of implementing the structural reforms necessary for more dynamic j ob creation. These critics were wrang regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assessment of the problems of the European economy is obviously correct. ., P.07/147 • The euro will complement, rather than detract from, structural reforms.Most importantly, a single currency will ease the flow of goods, servicesand capital within the eurozone. And the euro will also encourage ""crossfertilization"" · of best practices through stronger coordination of memberstates policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, workand job creation incentives, effective <U+FFFD>.,elfare safety nets, etc . .It is the reasonwhy European Council meeting in Luxemburg has decided to take thisnecessity into account and has explicitly mentioned structural policiesamong the items selected for reinforced coordination.-Tbe fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must <U+FFFD>eclearsighted with regard to the crucial question of competitiveness. Pre-euroeconomic policy meant monitoring trade balances, the balance of paymentsand the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thusreceived constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economicperformance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensible,multiple and very reactive.Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level or have seen their significance weakened, with the advent of the euro. But, of course, they remain on the euro-wide level. This is why the coordination of fiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. Nevertheless, the rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. 8 Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. The leaders of each national economy must therefore monitor competitivenesseven more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs, companies investments, and the tax and regulatory framework. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal accounts and foreign exchange markets, so economic managers must be even more vigilant in watching r other indicators. The sanctions for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. II/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL YIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETTER ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD. In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from European prosperity and growth as part of a health.y world economy. Clearly, the new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequences not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. Tue Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through the development of balanced economic relationships inside the euro fl area and with the countries out<U+FFFD>ide the European Union, and through thereinforcement of international financial and monetary stability.EMU will help to set balanced economic relationships. The relationsbip between monetary union and the other European countries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of the European Community .is required by the Treaty. lt is necessary for the European Union to function properly at the economic level. lt is important that the dialogue b<U+FFFD>tween all EU countries continues, even though the changeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchange<U+FFFD>rate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concemed (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the rt Danish krone since January Ist 1999) will play its part in this process. By promoting exchan.ge<U+FFFD>rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will help the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. t The Monetary Union will also have close relationships with countries outside the European Union. 10 :, p,10/14 f · First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive polefor our neighbours from central Europe. The results achieved by some ofthem during the last years show remarkable improvements. They must keepon making an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is intheir own interest and in the interest of current EU <U+FFFD>ember states.With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 290 millions inhabitants, and it will definitely have a major influence in the international community. Tue euro will make the international economic cooperation process easier between the main partners - the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Bach of them is in a position to speak on behalf of a }arge economic area. Moreover, each partner is vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. * * In conclusion, let me stress four points, taking stock ofthe meetings I participated in during the last three days. •l P.11/1411 1/ Firstly1 the global economy is doing much better than a year ago, which is the best demon_stration of an appropriate handling of thedifficult situation in which we were in September 1998. W orld output growing at a pace of 3% in 1999 and 3 ½% in 2000 is pretty encouraging.particularly striking is the fact that the newly industrialized Asian economies are likely to grow at a pace of a little more than 5%, both in 1999 andin 2000. This cails for two ""coups de chapeaun : one to the Asian economies themselves which have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adjust in a very short span of time. The second to the IFis, and in particular the IMF end the World Bank, which have demonstrated in the most difficult circumstances lucidity, determination and courage. I know that saying that is not fashionable. But it is precisely because it is not fashionable that it is worth saying it. 2/ Secondly. this is not the time for complacency. The global economy is in much better shape but remains fragile, taking into account the risks and the challenges that exist, facing the international community. We 12 111ust demonstrate that we, in the industrialized world, can take advantage of a quieter and calmer period to embark rapidly on the reforms that are needed. Amongst the reforms, I would like to emphasize particularly the necessity: - to foster structural reforms in Europe in order to consolidate theEuropean economy and to combat unemployment;- to improve the level of households savings in the US economv inorder to help alleviate the extemal imbalances that are currentlyobserved;- and to continue to reshape the Japanese economy througha12propriate and bald restructuring in the industry.3/ Thirdly, I am encouraged by a number of orientations that have been pragmatically adopted herein Washington in the recent days. I 13 see in particular three elements that are of great importance in my personal view: - the declaration of the G7 on tbe yen, which isJmportant because itcristallizes the consensus of the major industrialized countries in asimple and clear fashion. In my memory, markets have neverneglected such signals of the 07, which are given onlyexceptionally.- the statement on golg, underwritten by 15 central banks includingBanque de France, which states that gold will remain an importantelement of global monetary reserves.- And, last but not least, the solution given to the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries initiative which demonstrates that the internationalcommunity is mobilizing, through all possible channels,appropriate financing to help the poorest overcome theirdifficulties.14 4/ And fourthly, the strategic stance which seems to me the most appropriate conceming the Eurosystem could be summed up with the two keY words of confidence and vigilance, expressed by our President. Con:fidence in our currency, in its solidity, andin a non-inflationary and sound evolution of the European economy, which is displaying very encouraging sigris all over Europe and particularly in France. And at the same time, vigilance, because a central bank must never relax its vigilant stance -it is like driving a car, when everything is all right, the driver must not, even for a .minute, stop paying attention-, ·because <U+FFFD>evelopmeil,ts in the real econo<U+FFFD>y as well as in the monetary and financial fields have to be scrutinized very carefully in the present period, and because structural reforms are more than ever crucial in the euro area.

C'est au nom des liens historiques tres forts, qui unissent les pays europe<U+FFFD>ns entre eux et, en particulier, la Roumanie et la France, que je tiens a vous remerc,<U+FFFD>r tout particulierement de me donner maintenant !'occasion de presenter mon point de vue sur les conditions necessaires au plein succes de l'euro. Le 1 er janvier 1999 s'est produit un evenement exceptionnel dans l'histoire de l'Europe. L'euro est ne. Un nombre croissant d'acteurs de la scene politique et economique sont aujourd'hui convaincus que le succes de l'euro etait une necessite pou r l'Europe. II paracheve le marche unique europeen dent ii constitue la cle de voute, et ii favorise la prosperite de la zone, beneficiant ainsi au reste du monde. Mais, pour rendre ce succes complet et durable, nous devons prendre correctement en compte, aujourd'hui et demain, les implications de l'euro. Je souha i terais attirer en particulier votre attention sur les deux points suivants : - premierement, les membres de la zone euro devront relever un certain nombre dedefis pour faire en sorte que l'euro so it un plein succes;- deuxiemement, ce succes apportera sa contribution a !'amelioration de l'equilibreeconomique et monetaire international.I/ POUR QUE LE SUCCES DE L'EURO SOIT COMPLET, IL FAUT POURSUIVRE LES EFFORTS ET RELEVER UN CERTAIN NOMBRE DE DEFIS La reussite de !'introduction de l'euro constitue en soi une reforme majeure. Mais elle ne portera pleinement ses fruits que si un certain nombre de conditions sont remplies, au-dela de la seule politique monetaire, notamment en matiere de reformes structurelles. II y a quelques annees, ii a fallu convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, tant en Europe que dans le reste du monde, que le projet de l'euro etait coherent. Nombreux etaient ceux qui en denon<U+FFFD>aient les pretendues contradictions et incoherences : par exemple, l'impossibilite de doser de maniere convenable les politiques monetaire et budgetaire en !'absence d'une federation politique ; l'impossibilite de resister a des « chocs asymetriques » (c'est-a-dire des difficultes frappant l'economie d'un pays membre de l'Union et pas les autres); l'insuffisante flexibilite de l'economie et la mobilite relativement faible de la main-d'reuvre dans les pays europeens, etc. La conclusion eta it unanime: l'euro ne se ferait jamais ! Ces critiques ont ete dementies par les faits. Mais elles conservent toute leur utilite lorsqu'il s'agit de repondre a la question des conditions a remplir pour une pleine reussite de l'euro. On peut en souligner quatre : En premier lieu, celle de la credibilite de la politigue monetaire, garantie par l'independance de la Banque centrale europeenne (BCE), scellee dans le traite de Maastricht et fondee sur l'independance de chacune des banques centrales 2 ( nationales. Pour que l'euro soit une monnaie credible, ii doit inspirer confiance aux 292,6 millions d'Europeens de la zone euro, a nos autres partenaires de !'Union, ainsi qu'aux non-Europeens avec lesquels nous faisons des affaires. Le dialogue necessaire entre les responsables de la politique monetaire et les responsables de la politique economique prend naturellement totalement en compte l'independance du Systeme Europeen de Banques Centrales (SEBC) et l'objectif de stabilite des prix qui, en vertu du Traite, doit guider la politique monetaire de la zone euro. L'independance du SEBC est une condition du succes de l'euro et du succes de la politique economique europeenne. En tout etat de cause, le fonctionnement harmonieux de l'eguipe monetaire europeenne, composee de la BCE et des banques centrales nationales des onze pays fondateurs, facilitera la realisation de cette premiere condition relative a la credibilite et a l'independance de la politique monetaire. C'est cette equipe monetaire de onze joueurs, avec la BCE agissant comme un entraineur, qui joue sur le terrain avec un seul esprit d'equipe : et cet esprit d'eguipe est l'un des plus precieux atouts de l'Europe monetaire. En deuxieme lieu, le respect des dispositions du Traite et des orientations du Pacte de stabilite et de croissance en matiere de politique budgetaire s'impose. La coordination etroite des politiques budgetaires et la surveillance vigilante des « pairs » sont la responsabilite du conseil informel qui reunit regulierement les ministres des finances des onze Etats membres participants - « l'Euro 11 » - et du Conseil Ecofin qui reunit les ministres des finances des 15. Cette coordination et cette surveillance sont indispensables pour assurer un « policy mix » equilibre dans toute la zone euro. L'objectif a moyen terme de « finances publiques proches de l'equilibre ou en excedent » signifie que nul ne doit ceder a la tentation du deficit budgetaire individuel. Le respect de cet objectif est essentiel si l'Union veut pouvoir faire face collectivement a des periodes de difficultes economiques, et si chaque pays veut pouvoir surmonter des phases de deterioration de la conjoncture qui n'affecteraient que lui. II faut bien comprendre que la politique monetaire unique ne peut, a elle seule, assurer la stabilite des prix si elle n'est pas accompagnee d'une discipline budgetaire appropriee dans !'ensemble de l'Union economique et monetaire. Pour ma part, je citerai trois justifications economiques aux dispositions du traite qui ont donne naissance au Pacte de stabilite et de croissance. D'abord, en coordonnant les politiques budgetaires des Etats membres de l'Union monetaire, le pacte permet de doser de fa9on convenable les politiques monetaire et budgetaires (le ""policy mix') au sein de la zone euro. Cet element est essentiel pour la politique monetaire. Etant donne que l'Europe ne dispose pas d'un budget federal important, tout comme elle n'est pas dotee d'un gouvernement federal, la somme des budgets nationaux est !'equivalent du budget de !'ensemble de la zone euro. Cette situation rend necessaire une surveillance mutuelle etroite et la coordination des politiques budgetaires au sein de la zone. 3 I 28/02/00 16:59 Pg: 2 Ensuite, par le biais de l'instauration d'un systeme de sanctions financieres en cas de deficits excessifs, le pacte permet d'eviter que les economies bien gerees aient asupporter des primes de risque injustifiees. Enfin, le pacte de stabilite nous permet de refuter !'affirmation selon laquelle la zone euro ne dispose pas de stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de chocs asymetriques subis par un Etat membre. En realite, en incitant les Etats a viser a moyen terme une situation budgetaire proche de l'equilibre ou en excedent, le pacte leur permet de laisser s'accroitre les deficits budgetaires durant les recessions sans depasser la valeur de reference de 3 %. II leur permet de se constituer, durant les periodes economiques normales, un volant de securite budgetaire auquel ils peuvent recourir pour resister a un choc asymetrique. En troisieme lieu, tous les pays europeens doivent resolument s'engager aentreprendre des reformes structurelles. L'Europe continentale connait un chomage encore beaucoup trop eleve, meme si celui-ci enregistre une decrue dans la plupart des economies concernees. Selon le FMI et l'OCDE, ce chomage est, pour environ 80 %, de nature structurelle, c'est-a-dire qu'il est cree par le poids de nos propres reglementations et comportements. Le Conseil de la politique monetaire de la Banque de France partage cette analyse. Certains observateurs exterieurs reprochaient a l'Europe, tout recemment encore, de concentrer ses efforts et son energie politique sur la creation de l'euro au lieu de se consacrer a la mise en oeuvre des reformes structurelles indispensables a une creation plus dynamique d'emplois. Ces critiques avaient tort lorsqu'ils recommandaient de reporter la creation de l'euro mais ils avaient raison s'agissant du diagnostic sur les maux qui affiigent l'economie europeenne. L'euro, loin d'entraver les reformes structurelles, les favorise. La monnaie unique facilitera les mouvements de biens, de services et de capitaux au r- sein de la zone euro, et elle encouragera egalement la « fertilisation croisee » desmeilleures pratiques grace au renforcement de la coordination entre les politiques structurelles des Etats membres dans des domaines tels que: le fonctionnement du marche du travail, !'education et la formation, les incitations a la creation d'emplois, la meilleure efficacite des systemes de protection sociale etc. C'est pour prendre en compte cette necessite que le Conseil europeen de Luxembourg, en decembre 1997, a explicitement mentionne les politiques structurelles au nombre des sujets retenus pour la coordination renforcee. En quatrieme lieu, tous les responsables economiques d'Europe doivent comprendre les nouveaux enjeux relatifs a la question cruciale de la competitivite. La politique economique de la periode anterieure a !'introduction de l'euro consistait asurveiller la balance commerciale, la balance des paiements, les marches de change et de taux. Les gouvernements recevaient ainsi, en retour, des informations constantes sur les principaux indicateurs de !'evolution de l'economie nationale et pouvaient agir en consequence. Les indicateurs etaient sensibles, multiples et tres reactifs. 4 28/02/00 16:59 Pg: 2 Avec_ l'avenem_ent de l'euro, ces indicateurs ant vu leur portee s'affaiblir et pour certains, ant d1sparu au niveau national . Naturellement ils subsistent pou<U+FFFD> la zone euro _da<U+FFFD>s son ensemble : d'ou !'importance des dispositions du Traite sur lacoord1nat 1on des politiques budgetaires et des politiques economiques .Nea<U+FFFD>moins, les regles de l'economie de marche, et notamment la concurrence contin<U+FFFD>ent de s'appliquer a chacune des economies . Les consommateurs creent de<U+FFFD>em<U+FFFD>lo1s lorsqu'ils choisissent les biens et services qu'ils estiment presenter le me 1lleu_r <U+FFFD>apport 9u<U+FFFD>lite/prix .. L_es chefs d'entreprise peuvent repartir ces emplois dans _d1fferentes regions et d1fferents pays en fonction de la competitivite relative de ces . s1t<U+FFFD>s . 11 est done necessaire de suivre plus attentivement encore qu'auparavant les 1nd1cateurs de competitivite tels que !'evolution des coats unitaires de productionet l'environnement fiscal et reglementaire . Contrairement a la periode anterieure a l'euro, toute perte de competitivite, voire toute menace de perte de competitivite a terme, ne s'affichera pas rapidement sur les ecrans radar que sont notamment les marches de change, les marches de taux d'interet ou les comptes exterieurs. Les dirigeants economiques doivent done redoubler de vigilance sur le suivi des indicateurs pertinents en termes de competitivite. Les erreurs de politique economique risquent, en effet, d'etre sanctionnees d'une fayon plus lente et plus insidieuse, par la montee du chomage et le ralentissement de la croissance. II/ LE SUCCES DE L'EURO APPORTERA UNE CONTRIBUTION A UNEQUILIBRE ECONOMIQUE ET MONETAIRE MONDIAL APPROPRIE Dans la situation economique globale actuelle, le succes de l'euro va aider non seulement l'Europe mais aussi le reste du monde. En effet, nos partenaires, notamment les pays candidats a l'entree dans !'Union europeenne, sont eux-memes ,-- interesses et associes a la prosperite et a la croissance europeennes, elements essentiels de la bonne sante de l'economie mondiale . II est clair que le nouveau cadre monetaire europeen a ,et aura des consequence<U+FFFD> de grande ampleur non seulement pour !'ensemble de <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>urope _et de sa population, mais aussi pour l'economie mondiale et la communaute 1nternat1onale . La contribution de la zone euro a la stabilite internationale passera par l'instauration de relations economiques equilibrees, avec les pays exterieurs a l'Union europee<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> comme avec ceux situes a l'interieur de l'Union, et par le renforcement de la stab1hte monetaire et financiere internationale . Les relations entre I'Union monetaire et les autres Etats de l'Union europeenne seront fondees sur la coordination. La coordination des politiques economiques des <U+FFFD>tats m<U+FFFD>mbres est requise pa<U+FFFD> le Traite. Elle est necessaire au bon fonctionnement econom1que de la Communaute . 11 5 28/02/00 1&:59 Pg: 2 est important_ qu,e le dialog_ue entre _taus les Etats europeens se poursuive, meme sile pa<U+FFFD>sage a I euro mod1fie l'environnement economique traditionnel de l'Unioneuropeenne . En_ particulier, la coordination entre les 15 pays membres actuels permettra a ceuxqui n'ont pas encore rejoint l'Union monetaire de converger vers la zone euro. Lenouveau mecanisme de change (le ""MCE2"") qui lie a l'euro certaines des monnaiesconcernees (c'est le cas de la drachme grecque et de la couronne danoise, depuis le1er. . 19 Janvier 99) apportera sa contribution a ce processus. En favorisant la stabilitedes taux de change, le nouveau MCE permettra le ban fonctionnement du marcheunique et aidera les economies des pays qui n'ont pas encore rejoint la zone euro ase qualifier pour la monnaie unique. L'Union monetaire aura aussi des relations etroites avec les pays exterieurs al'Union europeenne. L'Union monetaire et l'Union europeenne constituent un pole attrayant, notamment pour les pays d'Europe centrale et orientale. Les resultats enregistres par certains d'entre eux au cours de ces dernieres annees temoignent de progres remarquables. lls doivent poursuivre leurs efforts afin d'etre capables de rejoindre l'Union europeenne, puis l'UEM dans de bonnes conditions, ce qui est de leur interet et de celui des pays membres de l'Union europeenne. En ce qui concerne la cooperation internationale, la zone euro va egalement jouer un role important. Elle represente une zone de stabilite et de croissance economique durable pour quelque 292,6 millions d'habitants et elle aura certainement une influence substantielle au sein de la communaute internationale. L'avenement de l'euro va faciliter la cooperation internationale en matiere economique notamment avec les Etats-Unis et le Japan. Chacun de ces partenaires est en mesure de parler au nom de regions dont !'importance economique est significative. De meme, chacun est individuellement expose de maniere relativement similaire aux chocs pouvant affecter le systeme financier international. L'euro devrait done favoriser des relations equilibrees dans lesquelles chaque partenaire assumera ses responsabilites, afin de contribuer a un environnement global stable. En conclusion, je voudrais mettre l'accent sur trois points:En premier lieu, la posture strategique qui est appropriee s'agissant de l'Euro­systeme, est resumee par les mots cles que sont la confiance et la vigilance. ?e sont cette confiance et cette vigilance qui expliquent notre decision du 3 fevner dernier, lorsque la BCE a hausse le taux des appels d'offre de 3% a 3,25%. Comme l'a explique Wim DUISENBERG, le President du Conseil des Gouverneurs, en notre nom a taus, notre decision s'explique par le souci de preserver, dans une 6 perspective de moyen terme, la stabilite des prix, et par-la meme de consolider les conditions d'une croissance aussi durable que possible, parce que non inflationniste. Par cette decision, nous avons voulu adresser un triple signal de confiance : D'abord, un signal de confiance, adresse a tous les agents economiques, dans la realite de la robustesse de la croissance de l'economie europeenne aujourd'hui. Ensuite, un signal de confiance, adresse aux entreprises en leur montrant que l'Euro-systeme veille a assurer la longevite de cette croissance. Enfin, un signal de confiance, adresse aux epargnants, sur la stabilite et la credibilite de la monnaie europeenne dans une perspective a moyen terme. Une majorite d'observateurs a bien compris la nature de ce triple message. (9 S'agissant de l'Euro et de son comportement sur le marche des changes je rappellerai que nous avons une position unanime du Conseil des Gouverneurs de la Banque Centrale Europeenne et que le porte parole du Conseil des Gouverneurs est notre president Wim DUISENBERG. C'est lui qu'il taut ecouter et personne d'autre pour avoir la position du Conseil des Gouverneurs. Je dirai simplement pour ma part que je ne suis pas satistait du niveau actuel de l'Euro et je m'en tiendrai la. En deuxieme lieu, ii taut bien retenir qu'il y a onze economies composantes mais une seule zone Euro. Celle-ci comprend 292,6 millions d'habitants, a une dimension economique presqu'egale a celle des Etats-Unis, une dimension commerciale superieure, et reflete un formidable potentiel, une diversite exceptionnelle. Les decisions du Conseil des Gouverneurs sont prises sur la base d'une analyse d'ensemble unique de la zone et non au terme d'une confrontation entre des points de vue nationaux differents. L'un des grands defis lances a l'equipe monetaire de l'Europe est que chaque Banque centrale nationale doit non seulement mettre en reuvre de maniere decentralisee la politique monetaire unique dans sa propre (' economie mais aussi expliquer inlassablement a sa propre opinion publique, dans le contexte de sa propre culture et avec sa propre langue, les raisons des decisions de politique monetaire de l'Euro-systeme tout entier. I I' Entin, en troisieme lieu, la derniere enquete d'opinion realisee en France, juste avant l'euro, en novembre 1998, montrait que 80 % environ des Franc;ais, de sensibilite de gauche comme de droite, taisaient confiance a la Banque de France pour assurer la stabilite des prix et du Franc. C'etait la plus belle recompense possible pour une institution independante, et dont l'independance a ete le fruit d'un consensus multipartisan. Les sondes indiquaient, dans la meme enquete d'opinion, dans la proportion de 95 %, qu'ils souhaitaient que l'euro soit au moins aussi solide que le Franc. Des reactions analogues de !'opinion sont observees dans les autres pays. En derniere analyse, une institution independante est responsable devant !'opinion publique. II s'agit, pour l'EUROSYSTEME tout entier, de se montrer digne de !'immense credit de confiance qui a ete accumule au cours de ces dernieres annees. 7 ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2000_06_04.json","04.06.2000","Speech by M. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France 0 « The euro at fifteen months >> Euromoney Conference Paris, April 6, 2000 r -E Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here, in Paris, in front of such a distinguished audience. I am particularly _ happy to express my views on the successful introduction of the euro, -and the necessary conditions for its durable success. But first within . - ' ' the context of this c~nference on the euro capital markets, let me recall recent announcements regarding mergers or close cooperation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearmg houses, and so forth. It is obvious that the setting up of the Euro is fostering large scale restructuring of markets throughout Europe. The Euro is a strqng catalyst for structural reforms in Europe. On the 1st of January 1999, a unique event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of political and economic actors that the success of the euro is a necessity 2 for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. It is clear that, now ~md for the future, we have to face a number of -challenges -to make this success sustainable. I would like today to draw your attention particularly to_ the following two issues: • F1rst, the euro area members have to meet certain conditions for the euro to be a-full success; • Second, the euro will make an important contribution towards r;; encouraging a balanced international monetary situation. r <-1/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP 3 --The successful introduction of the euro is, in itself, a major reform. But it will be fruitful only if some conditions are met, above and beyond monetary policy, in particular regarding structural reforms. A few ye~rs ago, it was .necessary to convince a _great _number ,.. . of sceptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was a viable project. Many people pointed_ to its presumed contradictions, and its alleged -inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achie'l.ing an efficient policy mix without a political federation;_the impossibility of avoiding some ""asymetric shocks"" (that is to say difficulties occurring in a r; Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility of the economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! r 4 r r Facts have refuted these criticisms. ·sut these criticisms are useful to help answering the question of what are the conditions for ensuring that the euro is a complete success. I see four conditions: -The first condition is tbe credibility . of monetary policy guaranteed by the independence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in the Maastrictit Treaty and rooted in the independence of each-national central bank. If the euro is to be a credible currency, it must-win the confidence of the 292,6 million Europeans in the euro area and also the confidence of other Europeans and non-Europeans with whom we do r; business. r , The necessary dialogue between monetary policy officials and economic policy officials must take into account the independence of the Eurosystem- the grouping of the ECB and the eleven national central banks- and also the objective of 5 r ,. ( price stability which, according to the Treaty, must guide the monetary policy of the euro area. Respect for the independence of the Eurosystem is a condition for the success of the euro and for the success of the European economic policy. As a m_?tter qf fact, the harmonious functioning of the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks from toe eleven founding euro area countries, will facilitate the compliance -with this first condition related to the credibility and the independence of the monetary policy. This is this full, eleven-member monetary team with the ECB acting as a coach, the Eurosystem, which is playing on the field, with a single team spirit ; and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of Europe. -The second condition is compliance with the provisions of the Treaty and the guidelines laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact with regard to fiscal policy. Close coordination of fiscal 6 policies and vigilant peer surveillance are the responsibility of the informal council of the eleven participating Member states -the ""Euro Eleven""- and of the ministers of finance of the 15 Member states convened in the Ecofin Council. Coordination and surveillance are essential for the success of a balanced policy mix throughout the eurozone. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surptus"" -me~ning nobody gets to run a selfish ·- -budget deficit - is indispensable for the union- as a whole to weather periods of economic difficulty and for individual -countries to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy. We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic and Monetary Union. 7 Indeed, for my part, I would give three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and -Growth Pact: - First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good -policy mix within _ the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy. Since - Europe_ does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has -no federal government, the sum of the national budgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This calls for close mutual surveillance and coordination of fiscal policies within the area. We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of th~ Economic and Monetary Union. 8 r I"" - Then, the pact helps prevent well-m.anaged economies from having to bear unjustified risk premia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits . . - Finally, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim for a fiscal position of «close to balance or -in suFplus» in the medium term, the -pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them tQ create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on, if an asymetric shock occurs. -The third condition, for a complete success, is that all European countries must resolutely undertake structural reforms. Continental Europe is experiencing too high levels of unemployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been 9 declining in most of its economies. According to the IMF arid the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment is structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council of the Banque de France and the Council of Governors · of the European Central Bank are in fufl agre~ment with this analysis. Just recently, some external observers were still reproaching Europe to focus its efforts and politica1 energy on the euro, -instead of implementing the structural reforms necessary for more dynamic job creation. These critics were wrong regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assessment of the problems of the European economy is obviously correct. The euro will complement and foster, rather than detract from, structural reforms. Most importantly, a single currency will ease the flow of goods, services and capital within the eurozone. And the euro will also 10 -, encourage ""cross fertilization"" of best p·ractices through stronger -coordination of member states structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, · effective welfare safety nets, etc .. lt is the reason _ why the december 1997 European · Council meeting in . Luxemburg has decided_ to ta~e this necessity into account and has explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced coordinatjon. The Lisbon European Council, held last march 23th, is a further important step towards the necessary medium term strategy for structural reform in the Union. -The fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must be clearsighted with regard to the crucial question of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic 11 performance ·and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensible, multiple and very reactive. Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level oc have ~een their significance weakened, with the advent of the euro. But, of course, they remain on the euro-wide level. This is also why the coordination of fiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. .: Nevertheless, the - rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness 12 fj even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs, and the tax and regulatory framework. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up so quickly on radar screens like exchange markets, interest rates markets or external accounts. So, economic managers mllst be even more vigilant in watching pertinent ---competitiveness indicators. The sanctions_ for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously via rising - unemployment and weak growth. II/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL YIELD A CONTRIBUTION TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD. 13 In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, our partners, notably the United States or the European countries which are candidates to enter the European union, are interested in and associated to European prosperity and growth as .part of a healthy world economy. ~learly, the new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching conseqt1ences not only for Europe as a -whole and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. o The euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through the development of balanced economic relationships between the euro area and the rest of the European Union, and with the countries outside the European Union, in particular through the reinforcement of international financial and monetary stability. 14 0 0 The relationship between the monetary union and the other countries of the European union will be based on coqrdination. Coordination of the . economic policies -of the 15 countries of the European Community is required by the Treaty. It is necessary for the European Union to function properly at the economic _level. It is important that the dialogue between all EU coJ:Jntries continues, even though the changeover to the euro modifies th~ - traditional economic environment of the European Union. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will -· allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchange-rate mechanism (ERM2) that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concerned (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1st 1999) will play its part 15 0 0 0 0 in this process. By promoting exchange-rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will help the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. The Monetary Union will also have close relationships with countries outside the European Union. First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for the accession countries. The results achieved by some of them during the last y~_ars show remarkable improvements. They must keep on making an effo-rt to be able to join the EU and, then, in due course, EMU in fitting conditions, which is in their own interest and in the interest of current EU member states. Second, with regard to international cooperation, the euro area will also play an important role. It represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 292,6 million 16 0 inhabitants, and it will definite.ly have a substantial influence in the international community. The euro will make the international economic cooperation process easier between the main- partners - the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Each of them is in a position to · speak on behalf of a large _ economic area. M.9reover, each partner is vulnerable to a rather 0 similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. Therefore, the euro should fosteF-a balanced 0 relationship in which each partner will take on responsibility for contcibuting to a stable global environment. * * * In conclusion, let me stress three points: Firstly, the strategy that is best for the Eurosystem can be summed up in two key words: confidence and vigilance. It was this confidence and this vigilance that lay behind our decision of 17 0 0 0 0 16 March last, when the ECB Governing Council raised the Eurosystem's tender rate from 3,25% to 3,5%. Our decision was made in order to maintain price stability over-the medium term. Economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. At the same time, upside· risks to price stability were seen as a reason for vigilance. The decision taken by the Governing Council addresses those upside risks"""" thereby strengthening the conditions for a growth path which is as sustain-able as possible by virtue of being non-inflationary. In taking this decision, we wanted to send out a three-fold signal of confidence: - a signal to -all economic agents of our confidence in the reality of the robust growth of the European economy today. 18 0 0 0 - a signal to businesses of our determination to ensure that this growth lasts as long as possible. -And finally, a signal to savers of our commitment to the stability and the credibility of the single European currency over the medium term. Indeed, observers_ did understand the nature of this three-fold signal. In the occasion of our mo_st recent meeting in Madrid, we agreed that the Gove__rning Council shall continue to be vigilant in order to be in a position,- if needed, to counter inflationnary eressure in a ·timely fashion. As regards the euro and its exchange rate I will remind that we have a unanimous position in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank : the present level of the euro does not reflect the significant recent improvement in the outlook for the euro area economy. 19 0 Secondly, as regards the recent evoi""ution of stock markets, I will recall that central banks have a special responsability as regards not only monetary stability but also financial stability. In this perspective, I wili stick to three short comments : · -First, we have witnessed a great deal of market volatility and _ excessive volatility is never desirable. -Second, '!!e call for investors to assess the merits, chances 9nd risks of their investments after thorough analysis of the -particular entity concerned and not on the basis of an irrational herd behaviour. Full transparency of the market and rational individual decisions are not only theoretically desirable but are preconditions for avoiding as much as possible the successive and contradictory waves of fashion. -Third, I suspect that the generalisation of « Indices based management» strategies should be monitored very carefully, as it probably fosters the « herd instinct » and the « herd 20 O behaviour » which are one of the majo""r problem we have today to cope with. Thirdly, we are experiencing in Europe economic -developments that are fostering major changes in the present mood which is still too « malthusian ». I see three main reasons o for such changes in the european psychology : firstly, major 0 (9 -structural reforms have been launched- the single market, the single currency-; secondly, a technological wave without precedent is boosting, not only the yibrant information technology sector, but also the full body of the economy ; and, last but not least, steady growth is now confirmed here. In that environment, a significant number of enterprises encounter difficulties in recruiting employees and we observe scarcity of skilled labor. According to the most recent survey, this is the case for 35 % of the French enterprises. Not surprisingly, we also note that, in spite of the recent dynamism 21 0 in fixed capital investment, the stock of capital is still insufficient, taking account the pressure of demand at the present level of capacity utilization rates. Not only have we got evidences that · the economy needs more skilled labor and more capital but the full body of the society is now convinced that an acceleration of productivity is welcome. 0 Central banks of the Eurosystem, and the B~mque de France in particular, are steadily antimatthusian. We call for more skilled labor -including by _ unleashing --additional hours- more investment -it is, more than ever, time to invest- and a-speeding up of productivity. o Because eliminating inflationnary bottlenecks is decisive to improve the non inflationnary growth potential and therefore to consolidate job creation and foster further diminishing of unemployment. 0 22 ","jean-claude trichet",""

I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful e<U+FFFD>Istence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. On 1st of January 1999, a unique event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLEMONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMICAND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE1.1. The euro is based on a credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralized organization of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important aspects : - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the precise adjustment of bankingliquidity and steering of short-term interest rates ;- the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by theEurosystem, both for the execution of the operations and in the field of large-valuepayments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the inter-bankmarket took place last year, right from the start of EMU, thanks to the setting upof the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in real timethroughout the euro area and other EU countries : the system now processesover 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 23 trillioneuros of which 42 % are cross-border payments. These figures show a significantincrease in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introductionof the euro;- the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organization of theEurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact withthe national central banks on the implementation of the operations.The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and by private r financial market operators. 2 <U+FFFD> bl Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Germany towards the Bundesbank, or in the other countries participating in the Euro zone, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six currencies which are now making up the euro - and represent two thirds of the GDP of the Euro area - had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also guaranteed by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the eleven and, as from next January, twelve euro area countries. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as players on the field, with a single team spirit; and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability­oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers, particularly in this country, as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4,5%, for growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with and helps maintaining price stability over the medium term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the Euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large : in particular the yields on long-term bonds 3 <U+FFFD> denominated in euro are clearly indicating that the Eurosystem has already earned a significant level of credibility. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, the President of the ECB holds a press conference - which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website. It is extremely important to stress that the EUROSYSTEM was the first in the world to introduce the 1st January 1999 the concept of regular, frequent, real-timetransparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates to which extent some criticisms are profoundly unjust ! It is very noteworthy, in this regard, that, soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real time transparency, the Federal Reserve System itself decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy - or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to the public opinion at large.In this respect the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to the attention of the national Institutions and national public opinions are decisive. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasonings that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a crucial part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the European and national Institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG is participating more often in hearings with the European Parliament in BRUSSELS than Alan GREENSPAN is on the Hill in WASHINGTON. Each national governor explains in nine different languages, through the grid of eleven - and, tomorrow, twelve - different cultures the same message of the EUROSYSTEM. In terms of transparency and accountability - namely the duty to explain, justify, whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis a vis public opinion for decisions taken - I think that the Eurosystem meets the best standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. The euro contributes to growth in Europe by enhancing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union; or that the lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, which could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any 4 asymmetric shocks and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force ... The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! Facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are now utilized to suggest that the Euro zone economy is full of deep and profound inconsistencies that are putting in danger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint on this very important question? Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily imply that, at any given point of time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Who knows that data on major cities of the US show that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The latest statistics available for the United States confirm that wages and salaries differentials within the euro area are not necessarily atypical for a recently­established monetary union: for example, the average weekly earnings in the non­durable goods sector work out to USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and at USO 644 in New Jersey. Significant disparities may even exist between the regions of a single-state country. A recent article published by the Financial Times presenting the results of the latest official survey of the UK's regions shows, for example, that per capita GDP was highest in London at £ 16,200 in 1999, followed by the south-east at £ 14,500, compared with only £ 9,800 in the north-east. People living in London enjoyed average weekly earnings of £ 520, compared with a UK average of £ 399 and, therefore, much lower earnings in the so-called ""depressed areas"". These differences might not diverge so much from the gaps observed between the economies of the euro zone within an integrated economic area of 293 millions inhabitants. My intimate conviction is that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. This has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations : I would mention authors like Artis and Zhang who found evidence that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, a well-functioning EMU means that all 5 Member States must be aware of the spill-over effect of all their national policies, ( ' especially their budgetary policies. In this respect, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, in full respect of the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly the euro zone is not devoid of the mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact : ( - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. ( - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro areahas no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a membereconomy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. To summarize on that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory which was developed by Mundell as early as 1961, has frequently been called upon by economists who criticised EMU and expressed concern about giving up the exchange rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks - in particular to asymmetric shocks within the monetary union. Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member-country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluationwere valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, I could also. refer to other economists such as Bayoumi and Eichengreen, who suggest thatdealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. 6 II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESSWhile many should acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask, at this point, what are the conditions for a full success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market al The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing impredictible and erratic exchange rates movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of next year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the facilities related to using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for merger and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be the most dynamic in the world : with operations totalling over USD 1 trillion in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. ( c Moreover, the euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered consolidation in the financial industry. This is true both on euro area money markets and on capital markets. (( - As from the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in themoney market increased so as to represent more than 50 % of the total activity inall segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit inter-bank market -which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities- exhibits a very high degree ofintegration. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a keyachievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR haveprovided the market with a uniform benchmark fully accepted by all marketparticipants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market,whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, forinstance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of theeuro interest-rate swap market.7 (_ ( ( These structural changes in the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. _ With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 836 billion euro in 1999, against 634 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. These figures soared to EUR 228 billion and EUR 182 billion, respectively, in the first quarter of 2000. From January 1999 to end-March 2000, according to the Bank of International Settlements, euro area private sector borrowers issued 76% of their debt in euros, compared to an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies as from the beginning of the decade. Similarly, private borrowers residing outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros since 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, fuelled by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, let me recall recent announcements regarding mergers or close co­operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses, and so forth. Had the Euro not been created, would have it been thinkable that the Paris, Brussel and Amsterdam exchanges would merge creating EURONEXT ? It is visible that the introduction of the Euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and in particular the take-off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. 11.2. The Euro is an incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes, earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, 8 r •-<U+FFFD>ffective welfar<U+FFFD> safety nets, etc .. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting<U+FFFD>n Luxembourg in De<U+FFFD>ember 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among theitems select<U+FFFD>d !or reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made afu<U+FFFD>her contnbut,on t? the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Urno<U+FFFD>. The emp_has,s put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issue<U+FFFD> closely: all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms on labour market. With increased capital mobility and a more perfect functioning of the single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be put on the competitiveness issue. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicato'rs affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like exchange markets, interest rates markets or external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Busin<U+FFFD>ssmen allocat<U+FFFD> these job<U+FFFD> _ to various possible locations in various countries according t<U+FFFD> the relat1v<U+FFFD>. compet1t1veness ofthese locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the c<U+FFFD>ntext, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. 9 * * * Let me address, in conclusion, three questions : growth, confidence in the future of the euro and the entry of sterling in the euro. Growth: Centr<U+FFFD>I bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with r<U+FFFD>spect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy -price stability- is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. That is the reason why the Governing Council has decided to increase our rates by 25 basic points duri<U+FFFD>g- o<U+FFFD>r last meeting. Wim DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of allof us that 1t 1s important to address potential inflationary risks ""in order to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations. We are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases -and thus ensure price stability- and to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70%. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in France and throughout Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. Confidence : The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world. In the current overall economic situation the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, Eur<U+FFFD>pe's partners -the United States and Japan- are interested in and associated with European prosperity and growth as part of a healthy world economy. And each partner is vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. In this respect, the recent joint 10 ( • intervention in foreign exchange markets by the main central banks in the world speaks by itself and is self-explanatory. And the communique of the G7 itself is cristalclear ; I quote : ""at the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the US, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada joined with the E. C.B. on Friday, September 22, in concerted intervention in exchange markets, because of the shared concern of Finance ministers and Governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy."" As regards the position of the Eurosystem itself it is equally cristalclear and I cherish a very eloquent short sentence to sum up our consensus : ""A strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". UK entry in the euro : Speaking here, in London, I cannot help mentioning the question of the entry of Britain in the Euro zone. I would like to stress the following points: - first of all, we should never forget that the UK is unanimously and warmlywelcome in the Euro area. It depends only on the decision of the British peopleand of the British authorities to join in. That situation compares extremelyfavourably with the episode of the entry of the UK in the EEC when the UK waswilling to join in and the EEC hesitating to accept her. Everybody on the continentis very warmly hoping for a positive decision by the UK.Secondly, I hope that I have been sufficiently convincing in this exposition that theeuro is the necessary last major tool for achieving the single market that has beenso strongly and unanimously supported by the UK. It is highly paradoxical - andeven, in a way, bizarre - that the UK hesitates to pursue and achieve her owncherished single market endeavour.And, thirdly, let us not forget the figures. The first January 2001, 12 members ofthe European Union out of 15 will be members of the Euro area, i.e. four fifth ofthe member states. These 12 members will represent four fifth of the Europeancitizens, namely 304 million out of 377 and four fifth of the consolidated GDP ofthe European Union. The economic advantages of participating fully in such avery large single market with a single currency are such that economic leaders allover the Euro area are fully supporting this extraordinary structural reform.May be you will forgive me to be so visibly in favour of the UK joining in. May be I have also personal reasons ! Being a French ""breton"" myself I cannot forget that a number of my ancestors were living in Britain. I cannot forget that in the time of the Roman Empire all ""Bretons"" were in the British Isles. And I cannot forget that when a French Breton refers to the old legends of Bretagne, to King Arthur, to Merlin and to Melusine, he refers to a single concept of Bretagne which is merging Great Britain and French Brittany as if the Channel did not exist. Thank you for your attention. 11 -","jean-claude trichet",""

( / 1.1/ t:IV .LU • _,_, • the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the<U+FFFD>- .Eurosystem, both for the execution of Its operations and in the field of large-valuepayments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbankmarket took place last year, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to thesetting up of the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in realtime throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system nowprocesses over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly1,000 billion euros daily, of which 43% are cross-border payments. These figuresshow a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EUsince the introduction of the euro;- the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, inwhich the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the nationalcentral banks on the ·implementation of operations.The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. b/ Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter a/ia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Germany towards the Bundesbank, or in the other countries participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, five of the currencies which now make up the euro--and 3 Fa>< re9U de 27/11/00 10 ;jj Pg : 20 represent two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence Is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the eleven and-from next January-twelve euro area countries. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand In hand. The Eurosystem Is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Hannonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part 1Jf the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds , 27/11/1::11::1 .Ltl • .:,.:, denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has already earned a significant level of credibility. d/ Finally, the credibility of the eura al8r.> ra$1.1lts from th<U+FFFD> F11rn:c;y""tAm'<U+FFFD> f'"".nn,:.t;:tnt efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference- which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website .. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 1st January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust I It is especially noteworthy I in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, the Federal Reserve System itself decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinio·n, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasoning that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the·communication of the European monetary team with the European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels more often than Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so in total in nine languages), 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 22 through the lens of eleven and tomorrow twelve different cultures the same message from the Eurosystem. In tenns of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to explain, justify, whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken- I think that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are now deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy is full of deep and profound inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very Important question? Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that 6 inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergence.s of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Ba/assa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the. US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector wurk uul <U+FFFD>l USO fi.40 at the national level, while standir,g at UCD 437 i"" Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey.· I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. In this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained In the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ''as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. 7 t:""_ .. , ............ . Fax re<U+FFFD>u de Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter o'f fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union,the pact ensures a· good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential formonetary pollcy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have asignificant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutualsurveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""EuroGroup'' and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective ofachieving budgets that are 11close to· balance or in surplus"" means that individualcountries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturnswhich affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mixthroughout the euro zone.- Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bearan unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits.- And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that theeuro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to amember economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""closet;e- to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscaldeficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. Inshort, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods thatcan be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks.To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal CutTency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks­in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of 8 Fax re<U+FFFD>u ae 27/1V00 10:33 Pg: 25 EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift ' in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued/"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESSWhile many acknowledge that the Introduction of the euro has been successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to continue ensuring the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of 2001; it will enable not only enterprises but all our -citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. g 1,<U+FFFD>v ••-· Fax re9u de 27/11/00 10:33 27/11/00 10:33 pq ; 27 Pg: 26 b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the 11· economic and financial environmeat. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion dollars in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in themoney market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity inall segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit interbank market­which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree ofintegration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a keyachievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR haveprovided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all marketparticipants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market,whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, forinstance. in the seal<U+FFFD> of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the eurointerest-rate swap market.These structural changes In the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has beensignificant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market.10 L......_ Fax re9u de 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 27 r The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro In 1999, against the aquivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated In US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first half of 2000 at 372 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issuecL,more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses. and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the Increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. 11 11.2. An incentive for further structural refonns 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 28 al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the mason why the European Council, meeting In Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on th<U+FFFD> structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot ·has already been done. in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that Is, generated by our own burdensome rules and ( regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural refonns in the labour market. Wrth increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms wlll become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate refonns. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be put on competitiveness. 12 Fax re9u de27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 29 Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising ·unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions . • * • Let me address, in conclusion, two issues: growth and confidence in the future of the euro. Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the end of the press conference following the ECB Governing Council_on 2 November, Wim 13 -, DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ""monetary policy will not accommodate Inflationary tendencies in the euro area and in this way will make its best contri<U+FFFD>ution to sustainable growth"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-Inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations. We are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to aJJow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy'"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. 1r- We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. ( We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advaniage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. 14 l'aX l't::YU ....... . 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 31 ... Confidence: The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world. In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, the euro-area's partners-in particular the United States and Japan­have a joint interest in global prosperity and growth. And each partner is vulnerable to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. And the communique of the G7 following the concerted intervention of the main central banks itself is crystal clear : ""at the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the US, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada joined withthe E.C.B. on Friday, September 22, in concerted intervention in exchange markets, because of the shared concern of finance ministers and governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy.n This intervention was followed by several rounds of intervention by the Eurosystem. Interventions on foreign exchange markets are not words : they are acts which speak by themselves. Finally, if I had to sum up the European position, entirely shared by the members of the Governing Council of the ECB and also shared by the Ministers of Finance, I would say: 11A strong euro is in the interest of Europe"".

It is also a great pleasure to rrteet again with my colleague Otmar lssing, between two meetings of the ECB Governing Council. I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, within ten months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary changeover the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. A decisive event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention on why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and on the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: 2 - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments.

This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosyste~ work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.

Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the 6 same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on · ' the successful completion of a convergence process. p Let us focus,4'or example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed around 1.5 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 0 In this regard, we are in favour of co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. But this co-ordination is already contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic pdlicies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be .drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. 8 0 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up theAexchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to ~oint out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If t~e argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, 0 · services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 0 0 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary insfrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. Preparatory work by the Eu~osystem and by national authorities is on track, not only in terms of technical work but also as regards communication to economic agents and the public at large bl Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion euros in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent around 60% of the total activity in all segments of the money market, namely deposits or repos and whatever the payment system used (Target, Euro 1, Euroclear, Clearstream, ... ). The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market. 10 0 These structural changes in the euro area ·money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term s~curities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro ·in 1999, against the equivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects 0 · not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation 11 0 of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets, in the conviction that their implementation would contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and_ to developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the 0 jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. 12 0 0 0 o · According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be put on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. 13 The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, 0 inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. 0 * * * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the press conference following the ECB Governing Council on 151 February, Wim Duisenberg said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ""within the euro area, the maintenance of price stability over the medium term ( ... ) will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled and unskilled labour in order to O • continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and 14 to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we alt welcomed the objectives of the 0 European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy"" skills. This is a very impdrtant decision which represents a conceptual turning point. 0 0 o · We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also antj-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. - As regards our present diagnosis on the situation we are very often asked three questions, namely : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability in the Euro zone ? "" ""What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe and in the US ? "" and finally ""What about the euro on the exchange markets?"". Let me respond to these three questions. To the first one I entirely share the analysis displayed, in the name of the Governing Council, by Wim Duisenberg :"" after the recent slowdown in monetary growth the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised"". As far as the conjuncture is concerned, I think the G7 communique is particularly appropriate to sum up our present diagnosis : ""In the Euro area, growth prospects remain favourable thanks to strong domestic demand"". The last figures we have coming from France are confirming this overall situation of the Euro zone : the January survey of Banque de France has been encouraging as far as orders, production, and consumption are concerned and the forecast for industrial investment in 2001 is + 9%. 15 As regards the US, I share the lucid optimism of the G? : ""Economic growth has 0 slowed, though economic fundamentals remain strong"". A soft landing of the US economy is the realistic working assumption. G 0 6 Finally, as regards exchange rates I will only mention that we are living in a universe of floating exchange system : in such a system exchange rates are not a target but they are a pertinent indicator for monetary policy. And I see only one sentence to sum up our position : ""A solid , a strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". Thank you for your attention. 16 ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2001_04_17.json","17.04.2001","Discours de M. Jean-Claude TRICHET Gouverneur de Ia Banque de France « L'EURO APRES PLUS DE 2 ANS D'EXISTENCE » Rennes, Chliteau d'Apigne, 17 avril 2001 )AS Mesdames et Messieurs, c' est pour moi un grand plaisir et un grand honneur de me trouver parmi vous aujourd'hui a !'invitation de . M. Cam.bray. Je suis heureux d'evoquer le succes de l'euro et de l'Union monetaire, et d'examiner les conditions de la consolidation de ce succes a l'avenir. -Comme vous le savez, 1' emission des billets et pieces en euro interviendra dans mains de neuf mois, le ler janvier 2002, et l'euro deviendra alors tangible pour tous. Ce sera le plus grand changement monetaire jamais organise dans le monde. Cependant, il (aut rappeler que d'un point de vue economique, monetaire et institutionnel, l'Union Monetaire a ete -.creee le 1 er janvier 1999. A cette date, s' est done deja produit un evenement unique dans l'histoire de !'Europe. L'euro a vu le jour et le caractere irreversible de ce changement a convaincu un nombre croissant d'agents economiques que le succes de la monnaie unique est necessaire a l'Europe. L'euro est un pilier du Marche unique, et il contribue a assurer a l'Europe une prosperite durable dans son interet et dans celui du reste du monde. Je souhaiterais attirer votre attention sur les raisons pour lesquelles l'euro et l'Union monetaire ont, des le depart, ete un succes et exposer les conditions necessaires pour preserver et renforcer ce succes a l'avenir. ,., I L'EURO ET L'UNION MONETAIRE SONT FONDES SUR UNE POLITIQUE MONETAIRE CREDIBLE · ET CONTRIBUENT A ASSURER UN EQUILIBRE ECONOMIQUE ET MONETAIRE SATISFAISANT EN EUROPE 1.1 L'euro est fonde sur une politique nionetaire credible, axee sur la stabilite . a) En premier lieu, il fautt souligner que, d'un point de vue technique _ et o perationnel, l 'introduction de l' euro sur les marches de capitaux, le·. 1 er janvier 1999, a incontestablement ete un succes. Et pourtant, il faut rappeler tousles doutes exprimes ace sujet il ya trois ans. L'ensemble compose de la BCE et des Banques Centrales Nationales de la zone euro a realise l~s objectifs qui lui etaient assign.es sur trois plans importants : - l'efficacite operationnelle, d'abord avec· le reglage precis de la liquidite bancaire et le pilotage sans faille des taux d'interet a court tenne; - la securite fournie par les procedures et systemes mis en ceuvre par l 'Eurosysteme, pour l' execution des operations interbancaires et pour les paiements de montant eleve. L'integration du marche interbancaire est intervenue en 1999, des le debut de 1~union Monetaire, grace a la mise en "") place du systeme Target destine a traiter les paiements de montant eleve, en temps reel, dans l' ensemble de la zone euro et dans les autres pays de l 'UE : ce systeme traite en moyenne plus de 4 millions de paiements par mois, et, en valeur, environ 1100 milliards d' euros par jour sur lesquels 40 % concement des paiements transfrontiere. Ces chiffres refletent la forte progression du recours aux paiement en temps reel dans l 'UE depuis l' introduction de l' euro ; le fonctipnnement harmonieux de l'Eurosysteme qm est une organisation integree dans laquelle le centre de decision travaille en contact permanent avec les banques centrales nationales pour la mise en reuvre des operations. Les rru.sons de ce succes resident principalement dans les travaux preparatoires approfondis qui ont ete menes durant plusieurs annees par les banques centrales et par les operateurs prives des marches de capitaux. b) En second lieu, conjointement avec d'autres facteurs, ce succes technique et operationnel a contribue a un degre eleve de credibilite de Ia politique monetaire unique, qui est garantie, entre autres, par l' independance de la Banque centrale europeenne et des banques centrales nationales. L'Eurosysteme a herite d'un capital de confiance, accumule pendant plusieurs decennies par les banques centrales nationales. Ainsi, en France , la derniere enquete d'opinion indiquait que 80 % des citoyens font t;; confiance a la Banque de France . Le niveau de confiance des citoyens des ,t autres pays participant a la zone euro, envers leur banque centrale nationale, est certainement aussi eleve. II faut . rappeler que contrairement a ce qui est souvent dit, l 'Union Monetaire n'a pas demarre de zero. Il est particulierement interessant de souligner que pendant les douze annees qui ont precede le lancement de la monnaie unique, cinq devises, faisant desormais partie de l' euro et representant pres des deux tiers du PIB -de la zone, s' etaient revelees remarquablement stables, n'ayant fait l'objet d'aucun realignement au sem duMCE. Ce degre eleve de confiance est egalement garanti par le fonctionnem~nt homogene de l'Eurosysteme: l'equipe monetaire europeenne, composee aujourd'hui de la BCE et des BCN de 12 pays membres puisque nous avons accueilli le 1 er janvier 2001 un nouveau membre, la Banque de Grece. Tous les membres de l'Eurosysteme travaillent constamment main dans la main. L 'Eurosysteme est une equipe monetaire unique, dont ~ l'entraineur et le chef d'equipe est la BCE et les joueurs, les BCN, animes par un esprit d'equipe commun; et cet esprit d'equipe constitue l'un des atouts inappreciables de la zone euro. c) en troisieme lieu, la credibilite de la BCE depend, fondamentalement, de sa strategie de politique monetaire, fondee sur la stabilite . Le traite de Maastricht nous a donne un mandat pour maintenir la stabilite des prix. Nous avons choisi d'etre aussi clairs et transparents que possible en donnant une definition precise de la stabilite des prix: celle-ci se C caracterise par une augmentation de l'indice des prix a la consommation harmonise de la zone euro inferieur a 2% en glissement annuel. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons fonde notre politique monetaire sur deux piliers. Le premier pilier, repose sur une valeur de reference -que nous avons fixe a 4.5%-, pour la progression annuelle de l'agregat monetaire large, M3. En decembre dernier, nous avons reconduit ce taux de progression de 4,5 % pour M3, qui est un indicateur important pour stabiliser les anticipations. II faut noter · que le concept de valeur de reference n~impose pas a l'Eurosysteme !'obligation de corriger automatiquement les ecarts constates de M3 a court terme. Neanmoins, !'existence d'une valeur de reference pour M3 va dans le sens de la stabilite des prix et permet de la maintenir a moyen terme. Le second pilier de la strategie de politique monetaire est fonde sur une large gamme d'indicateurs, dont l'utilite fondamentale a nos yeux est d'indiquer ,-pour l'avenir, les evolutions de prix dans la zone euro. Cette strategie assure un important element de continuite avec les politiques monetaires menees auparavant _ par les BCN appartenant a l'Eurosysteme. Elle semble avoir ete bien per~me par les marches de capitaux et le grand public : en particulier, les rendements des obligations a long terme libellees en euros, inferieurs a 5 %, confirment que les marches ont confiance et que l'Eurosysteme a preserve le capital de credibilite dont ii a herite. d) Enfin, la credibilite de l'euro resulte egalement des efforts constants de l'Eurosysteme en matiere de transparence et de communication. J'en profite ici pour mettre !'accent sur le fait que l'Eurosysteme est l'une des Banques centrales les plus transparentes du monde. Une fois par mois, immediatement apres la reunion du Conseil des Gouvemeurs, le president de la BCE tient une conference de presse qui commence par un expose detaille du diagnostic porte par le Conseil des Gouvemeurs et qui est publiee en temps reel sur le site internet de la BCE. Cela a ete le cas par exemple lors de notre derniere reunion a Francfort, mercredi dernier. Je souligne que l'Eurosysteme a ete la premiere Banque centrale a introduire des le ler janvier 1999 l'idee d'une communication regulie!e, frequente et ""en temps reel"" dans le domaine de la politique nionetaire. Cela montre a quel point certaines critiques peuvent etre _ injustes! II convient de noter, a cet egard, qu'aussitot apres !'adoption de ce nouveau concept de transparence ""en temps reel"", d' autres grandes banques centrales ont decide de nous emboiter le pas. Etre responsable signifie, pour une institution independante au sein d'une democratie modeme - ou, comme c'est le cas, pour l'Eurosysteme, au sein d'un ensemble subtil de diverses democraties, comme !'Union europeenne - etre responsable vis-a-vis de !'opinion publique, au sens large. A cet egard, tant les discours et les declarations du president de la BCE a I' attention des Institutions et de I' opinion publique europeennes que ceux des gouvemeurs des BCN aupres des fustitutions et des opinions publiques de leur Etat respectif revetent une importance fondamentale. C 'est en effet ,., un des elements essentiels de notre tache collective que d'expliquer inlassablement les raisons et les arguments qui etayent les decisions prises par le Conseil des Gouvemeurs. On sous-estime actuellement la qualite du dialogue entre l'equipe monetaire europeenne, d'une part, et les institutions europeennes et nationales et !'ensemble de la societe civile d'autre part. Wim DUISENBERG participe aussi souvent a des auditions aupres du Parlement europeen a BRUXELLES gue ne le fait Alan GREENSPAN au Capitole a WASHINGTON. Et les gouverileurs des BCN transmettent le meme message de l 'Eurosysteme dans dix langues differentes et au travers de douze referentiels culturels distincts. C'est potrrquoi, je pense que du point de vue de la responsabilite de· Banque Centrale dans une societe democratique -c'est-a-dire le devoir d'expliquer, de justifier, si possible de convaincre, et en tout cas d'assumer la pleine responsabilite des decisions prises vis-a-vis de }'opinion publique-,je pense que l'Eurosysteme est au premier rang des grandes banques centrales du monde. 1.2 L'euro contribue significativement a la croissance en Europe et favorise le renforcement de la coordination des politiques economiques II y a quelques annees, il fallait convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, non seulement en Europe mais egalement dans le monde, de la certitude du lancement de l' euro. De nombreux observateurs soulignaient ses supposees contradictions et ses pretendues incoherences, en proclamant par exemple que les divergences economiques et les ecarts structurels entre les pays de 0 la zone euro seraient trop importants pour garantir la viabilite de l 'union monetaire; ou que faute d'une coordination des politiques economiques, la zone euro ne disposerait pas du policy-mix approprie, que l'on ne pourrait done realiser l'euro sans une federation politique prealable. D'autres objections ont ete soulevees: absence d'instruments permettant de repondre a un choc asymetrique, rigidite et faible mobilite du facteur travail dans les peys europeens ... On en a tire la conclusion que l'euro n'existerait jamais ! Les faits ont infirme cette conclusion. Mais les memes arguments sont utilises pour suggerer que la zone euro comporte des contradictions qui mettent en danger sa prosperite. Que peut-on dire sur ce sujet fondamental, du point de vue de !'analyse economique ? En premier lieu, l'Union monetaire n'implique pas necessairement que tous les pays participants disposent,-a un instant donne du meme taux d'inflation ou de croissance, meme si le passage a I' euro s 'est appuye sur la reussite du processus de convergence. Prenons, par exemple,' l'inflation. Les ecarts actuels constates en Europe ne semblent pas tres importants par rapport a ceux constates aux Etats-Unis, qui constituent une Union monetaire ancienne, d'importance comparable a celle de !'Union Monetaire. Sait-on que outre-Atlantique, les ecarts d'inflation entre les principales villes ont ete parfois tres importants,-de l'ordre de 7 % au debut des annees quatre-vingt? n Dans la zone euro, la convergence a long terme vers un niveau common de prix conduit naturellement a !'apparition de differences de taux d'inflation, d'un pays a l'autre de !'Union Monetaire. La convergence de la productivite et des niveaux de vie cree une tendance a la convergence des prix, resultant de l'effet bien connu de Balassa-Samuelson. Selon le FMI, cet effet pourrait contribuer a hauteur de 1,5-2,0 points de pourcentage par an a l' inflation des pays de l 'UE rattrapant leur retard en matiere de productivite et de niveau de vie. Les statistiques les plus recentes disponibles concemant les Etats-Unis confirment aussi que les ecarts_ de salaires au sein de la zone euro ne sont pas necessairement atypiques dans une union monetaire : par exeinple, -en 2000, les revenus hebdomadaires dans le secteur des biens non durables s'etablissaient en moyenne a 546 dollars au niveau national, tandis qu'ils ressortaient a 437 dollars au Mississippi et a 644 dollars dans le New Jersey. J'ai l'intime conviction que nous assistons a une integration croissante des pays europeens et a une synchronisation de plus en plus manifeste entre les evolutions economiques de la zone euro. Plusieurs etudes universitaires demontrent que les cycles conjoncturels sont de plus en plus harmonises en Europe. En deuxieme lieu, on s'est souvent demande si l'Union Economique et Monetaire pouvait etre un succes sans une union politique renforcee. De fait, le hon fonctionnement de l'UEM implique que tousles Etats membres 1 ( r. aient conscience de l'effet d'entrainement de leurs politiques nationales et notamment budgetaires. C'est pourquoi nous sommes favorables a une forte coordination des politiques economiques. Cette coordination est au demeurant inscrite dans le Traite lui-meme qui demande aux Etats membres de considerer leurs politiques economiques nationales comme une « question d'interet commun »eta les soumettre a une procedure multilaterale. Naturellement, cette coor~ation economique doit elle-meme respecter strictement l'independance de la Banque Centrale Europeenne et de l'Eurosysteme. Plus important encore, la zone euro dispose elle-meme de mecanismes institutionnels propices a un policy mix approprie : le Pacte de Stabilite et de Croissance comporte, de la part des Etats membres, des engagements importants sur le plan budgetaire. Je citerai, pour ma part, trois justifications economiques aux dispositions du Traite qm ont donne naissance au Pacte de stabilite _ et de croissance : - Premierement, en coordonnant les politiques budgetaires des Etats membres de l 'Union monetaire, le Pacte · garantit un policy mix satisfaisant au sein de la zone euro. Cela est essentiel pour la politique monetaire, afin de pallier le fait que l'Europe ne dispose pas d'un Gouvemement federal et done pas d'un budget ""federal"" significatif. La surveillance mutuelle et la coordination etroite des politiques budgetaires incombent aux Ministres des Finances dans le cadre de l' « Eurogroupe » et du Conseil Ecofin. Le respect de la limite maximale de 3 % de deficit et de 1' objectif de moyen terme consistant a parvenir a 1 1 des soldes budgetaires « proches de l 'equilibre ou en excedent » garantit un equilibre convenable du ""policy mix"" de !'ensemble de la zone Euro. - Deuxiemement, le Pacte permet de premunir les economies bien gerees contre une ""prime de risque"" injustifiee sur les taux d'interet qui leur serait infligee du fait de la mauvaise gestion d'autres economies de !'Union monetaire, grace a la dissuasion exercee par un systeme de penalites en cas de deficits excessifs . - Enfin, le Pacte de stabilite nous permet de refuter I' affirmation selon laquelle la zone euro ne possede pas de stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de chocs asymetriques affectant une economie membre . En effet, en pressant les gouvemements .de parvenir, a moyen terme, a un solde budgetaire « proche de l' equilibre ou en excedent », le Pacte_ leur perm et d'accroitre leurs deficits budgetaires, en periode de difficultes nationales specifiques, dans la limite de la valeur de reference de 3 %. En resume, il leur permet effectivement de creer un « amortisseur » budgetaire durant les phases economiques normales, susceptible d'etre utilise pour faire face a des ecarts ou a des chocs asymetriques, en periode de moins bonne conjoncture. II est interessant d'evoquer ici la theorie de la« zone monetaire optimale », developpee par Mundell des 1961, qui a parfois ete invoquee par les economistes qui critiquaient l 'UEM et exprimaient des craintes quant a l' abandon de l 'instrument du taux de change permettant de reagir a des chocs asymetriques. Le Professeur Mundell a lui-meme, pour soutenir l 'UEM, apporte un eclaircissement interessant au debut de 1998 : dans le cas d'une augmentation unilaterale de la demande adressee par un Etat membre a un autre, creant du chomage pour le premier et des tensions inflationnistes pour le second, les tamc de change flottants ne seraient pas necessairement la voie la meilleure pour resoudre le probleme. Je cite :· « Si I 'argument en faveur de la devaluation etait valable, ii pourrait aussi bien s 'appliquer a chaque Etat federe ou region de n 'importe quel pays, avec une proliferation de nouvelles monnaies, de fa~on qu 'el/es puissent etre devaluees I». Dans le meme esprit, je pourrais egalement citer d'autres economistes tels que Bayoumi et Eichengreen, selon lesquels venir a bout des ecarts s~cturels et des asymetries dans la zone euro ne devrait pas etre beaucoup plus complique que dans une union monetaire etablie depuis longtemps, telle que les Etats-Unis. II. L'EURO EST, EN SOI, UN CATALYSEUR PERMETTANT LA POURSUITE DES PROGRES Si de nombreuses personnes reconnaissent que !'introduction de l'euro a ete dans !'ensemble une reussite, on peut se demander, ace stade, quelles sont les conditions necessaires a la confirmation et au renforcement de son succes a moyen et long terme. Ce qui est tres-encourageant a cet egard, c' est que dans un certain nombre de domaines, I' euro apparait en soi comme etant un catalyseur propice a la realisation de ces conditions. 11.1. L'euro approfondit et paracheve le marche unique a) L'euro permet d'achever la construction du marche unique. L'objectif de celui-ci est de permettre au secteur productif et amc entreprises de 1.., I. realiser des economies d'echelles substantielles, et a toute l'epargne europeenne d'etre orientee vers les investissements les plus efficients. II renforce egalement la transparence des marches et stimule la concurrence et !'innovation au profit des consommateurs. Cependant, l'objectif final du marche unique ne pouvait pas etre pleinement atteint tant que des obstacles monetaires contrecarraient la libre circulation des biens, des services, des capitaux et, d'une certaine maniere, des personnes, en imposant des variations imprevisibles et erratiques des taux de c~ange et des cofits de transaction. La derniere etape de ce processus sera franchie avec l' introduction de la monnaie fiduciaire en euros a la fin de cette annee ; elle permettra non seulement aux entreprises -ce qui est le cas depuis le 1 er janvier 1999- mais egalement a taus nos concitoyens de beneficier des avantages lies a !'utilisation du meme instrument monetaire a travers le continent europeen, a l' instar des Americains aujourd'hui sur le territoire des Etats-Unis. b) En outre, l'introduc~ion de l'euro engendre une mutation profonde de l'environnement economique et financier. L'introduction de l'euro a ete un catalyseur puissant des fusions et acquisitions dans la zone euro. Le marche europeen des fusions et acquisitions est parmi les plus dynamiques au monde avec un montant total d'operations s'elevant a environ 900 milliards de dollars en 2000, derriere le marche americain. L'euro a favorise des mutations structurelles dans le secteur financier, tant pour les marches monetaires de la zone euro que pour les marches de 1 A !'argent a plus long tenne, et ceci permet aux investisseurs de la zone de disposer de possibilites accrues et de meilleures conditions de placement et de financement. - A partir du I er janvier 1999, les operations transfrontieres sur le marche monetaire se sont accrues pour atteindre plus de 50 % de l'activite totale, sur tous les segments de ce marche. Le marche interbancaire des depots en blanc - qui est principalement concentre sur les echeances a tres court terme - presente un tres haut degre d'integration. L'integration des marches de taux d'interet au sein de la zone euro est une realisation majeure qui merite d'etre soulignee. L'Eonia et l'Euribor ont ""fourni au marche des - taux de reference uniforme pieineni.ent :· --acceptes par tous les intervenants. Le diagnostic est le meme sur le marche des produits derives de court terme, dont !'integration, la standardisation et la profondeur se sont accrues. Ce phenomene se reflete par exemple dans le montant des operations quotidiennes et le developpement col}siderable du marche des swaps de taux en euros. Ces mutations structurelles du marche monetaire de la zone euro ont amene les intervenants des marches a concentrer leur activite de gestion de tresorerie en euros et a beneficier ainsi d'une meilleure liquidite sur le marche secondaire. Naturellement, ii faut mener a bien cette integration sur les autres segments du marche monetaire, a savoir le marche des pensions et le marche des titres a court terme. La poursuite de !'integration renforcera l 'efficience des marches de capitaux de la zone euro et sera benefique tant pour les emprunteurs que pour les investisseurs. 1 C - S'agissant des marches obligataires et boursiers, les progres realises sur la voie de !'integration ont egalement ete significatifs. Selon des statistiques recentes, l' euro aurait ete la premiere monna1e d'emission obligataire devant le dollar durant le premier trimestre de cette annee avec 46 % des emissions intemationales d'obligations contre 44 % pour le dollar. De plus, les investisseurs europeens ont considerablement diversifie leurs portefeuilles obligataires depuis !'introduction de l'euro, phenomene favorise par la suppression du risque de change. Cela leur permet d'ameliorer leurs performances pour un niveau donne de risque. Permettez-moi en outre de rappeler la tendance aux fusions· ou aux -cooperations etroites entre Bourses, systemes de reglement de titre, chambres de compensation, etc. Si l'euro n'avait pas ete cree, aurait-il ete concevable que les Bourses de Paris, Bruxelles et Amsterdam fusionnent pour creer EURONEXT? Visiblement, !'introduction de l'euro favorise des restructurations d~ marches a tres grande echelle dans toute I 'Europe. II existe encore quelques obstacles a Ic1: poursuite de !'integration des marches financiers de !'Union europeenne. A· cet egard, l'Eurosysteme s 'est felicite que le Conseil europeen reuni a Lisbonne en mars 2000 se soit assigne comme objectif d'accelerer l'achevement du marche interieur des services financiers et de definir un calendrier rigoureux de maniere a pouvoir mettre en reuvre le plan d'action pour les services financiers avant 2005. L'Eurosysteme apporte aussi son soutien aux conclusions strategiques du Comite des Sages sur !'integration des marches europeens de valeurs mobilieres et accueille favorablement le reglement qui s' en est r suivi et qui a ete adopte au Conseil Europeen de Stockholm de mars dernier : nous sommes convaincus que la mise en place de ces grandes orientations vont contribuer a une meilleure allocation du capital · dans l'economie europeenne et a des developpements sur les marches d'actions conformes aux besoins de la politique monetaire. 11.2. L'euro est un stimulant pour la_ poursuite des reformes structurelles a) L'euro est, en soi, egalement, un puissant catalyseur de reformes structurelles en Europe dans tous les domaines non-financiers : une monnaie unique facilite une comparaison complete des prix, de·s impots, -- .·.-des revenus. Je pense que l'euro pourrait favoriser la « fertilisation croisee » des meilleures pratiques par le biais d'un renforcement de la coordination des politiques structurelles des Etats membres dans des domaines comme les marches du travail, !'education et la formation, les incitations a la cre_ation d' emplois, I' efficacite de la protection sociale, etc. C'est la raison pour laquelle · le Conseil europeen, .reuni a Luxembourg en decembre 1997, a explicitement mentionne les politiques structurelles dans les elements · retenus pour renforcer la coordination. Le Conseil europeen de Lisbonne a apporte une nouvelle contribution a la strategie a moyen terme necessaire aux reformes structurelles dans !'Union. L'accent mis sur l'approfondissement du marche unique, la definition d'indicateurs permettant d'etablir des comparaisons des meilleures pratiques parmi les Etats membres, le fait que les grandes orientations de politique economique, agreees en commun, comporteront un examen attentif des questions structurelles : ,,.., toutes ces evolutions vont dans le bon sens. Le recent Conseil Europeen de Stockholm a confirme ces orientations et y a meme ajoute des themes aussi importants que le vieillissement de la population de l'Union Europeenne et le role des biotechnologies dans la croissance economiqueeuropeenne Tous les pays europeens doivent resolument poursuivre les reformes de structures deja initiees. Il faut reconnaitre que beaucoup a ete fait, en particulier avec la mise en reuvre du marche unique. Toutefois, !'Europe enregistre encore des niveaux de chomage trop eleves, meme si, depuis trois ans, le taux de chomage a nettement baisse dans la plupart de_~ economies concemees. Selon le FMI et l'OCDE, -et les banques centrales partagent ce sentiment- il s'agirait a pres de 75 % d'un chomage structure!, c'est-a-dire genere par un environnement comportant de nombreux obstacles a la creation d'emplois. L'Union Monetaire stimule incontestablement la ID1se en reuvre de reform es structure Iles sur le marche du travail. L' accroissement de la mobilite du capital et le fonctionnement fluide du marche unique vont rendre les entreprises de plus en plus sensibles a l'environnement general du point de vue de leur competitivite quand elles choisiront un lieu d'implantation dans la zone euro. Le mecanisme meme de la localisation des investissements dans la zone euro constituera une incitation importante a !'engagement des reformes necessaires. b) Outre les reformes structurelles, ii convient d'ailleurs d'insister tout particulierement sur !'importance des questions de competitivite 10 Avant la creation de 1' euro, la conduite de la politique economique comportait en particulier la surveillance de la balance des paiements et des marches de changes et de taux d' interet. Les auto rites recevaient constamment des informations sur les indicateurs-cle affectant les resultats economiques de leur pays et pouvaient, en fonction de ceux-ci, prendre des mesures appropriees. Ces indicateurs etaient sensibles, multiples et tres reactifs. Desormais, avec la monnaie unique, une perte de competitivite apparait plus rapidement sur les « ecrans radars » que sont les cours de change~ les marches de taux ou les comptes exterieurs. Des lors, les responsables-de l' economie sont appeles a suivre l 'evolution des indicateurs de competitivite avec encore plus de vigilance. Car les erreurs de politique economique sont desormais sanctionnees plus tardivement et insidieusement par le biais d'une hausse du chomage et d'une faible cr01ssance. Les regles de l 'economie de marche continuent de s' appliquer a toutes les economies membres de la zone Euro. Les emplois sont crees par les consommateurs -totalement libres d'acheter ce qu'ils veulent- quand ils choisissent les biens et services qu'ils estiment offrir le meilleur rapport qualite-prix. Les entreprises - totalement libres dans leurs choix d'investissements - localisent ces emplois sur les meilleurs sites d'implantations, en fonction de leur competitivite relative. II est done necessaire de surveiller la competitivite plus etroitement encore 1n qu'auparavant, en particulier les couts unitaires de production et le cadre fiscal et reglementaire. La surveillance multilaterale exercee dans le cadre de I' Eurogroupe doit permettre de suivre les tendances de la competitivite - dans chaque economie et dans la zone dans son ensemble - et de suggerer, le cas echeant, les corrections appropriees. * * * En conclusion, j 'aimerais evoquer deux points : la question de la croissance · ·· et le diagnostic actuel de l'Eurosysteme sur la situation economique et monetaire. La croissance d'abord : Les -responsables des banques centrales europeennes sont par.(ois presentes comme faisant preuve d'une prudence ,~ et d'une reserve excessives en ce qui conceme la croissance economique. En realite, nous sommes tout a fait favorables a la croissance. D'abord et avant tout parce que l'objectif meme de la ' politique monetaire - la stabilite des prix - ouvre la voie a une croissance robuste et durable a moyen et long terme. Je vois trois principaux canaux a travers lesquels la stabilite des prix favorise la croissance. D'abord, en preservant et en renforyant la competitivite du secteur productif grace a une inflation faible et, par la, des cot1ts de production unitaires bas. Ensuite, en renforyant la confiance des epargnants dans la capacite des instruments monetaires et financiers de bien conserver leur valeur a long terme, ce qui permet de preserver de bas taux d'interet de marche a moyen et long terme. Et, enfin, en encourageant la demande interieure grace a la preservation du pouvoir d'achat des menages due a la faible inflation. Cette derniere contribution a la croissance est a l 'heure actuelle particulierement importante dans la zone euro. En renforyant la confiance de la population europeenne clans la capacite de l'Eurosysteme a assurer la stabilite des prix, nous preservons par la meme la confiance globale des consommateurs et done le niveau de la demande. L'Eurosysteme cherche a atteindre une cr01ssance stable et non inflationniste non seulement grace a son action directe de politique monetaire mais egalement par le biais de ses recommandations. L'objectif d'une cr01ssance durable, soutenue et non inflationniste, permettant de ramener le chomage a son etiage, sera d'autant mieux atteint que !'Europe adoptera resolument une attitude ouverte a l'egard des ""facteurs"" de production - travail, capital et progres technique - qui sont a la ·source de la croissance. La persistance d'un chomage de masse - dont les causes structurelles etaient mal comprises - avait longtemps conduit les europeens a adopter certaines attitudes malthusiennes : la circonspection a l'egard du progres technique car ii serait potentiellement destructeur d'emplois ; le refus d'investissements de productivite supposes contribuer a l'augmentation du chomage ; enfin, la recherche d'une diminution des forces de travail disponibles dans l'idee de reduire le chomage. Nous sommes heureusement en train de changer profondement de perspective en Europe et de nous eloigner de certaines de ces attitudes 'I I r malthusiennes sous l'intluence notamment des nouvelles technologies de !'information et de la communication, et de la constatation que !'apparition de goulets d'etranglement preintlationnistes pourrait faire obstacle a une croissance forte et durable parce que sans inflation. Pour concretiser ce changement d'etat d'esprit, trois orientations font desormais l'objet d'un consensus de plus en plus large, comme il ressort des dernieres reunions du Conseil europeen : - investir massivement et desserrer les contraintes pesant sur le facteur capital. L'investissement est essentiel dans des economies dans lesquelles le taux d'utilisation des capacites de production est a un niveau historiquement eleve et ou une proportion importante des entreprises rencontre des goulets d'etranglement pour la production ; - desserrer les contraintes pesant sur le facteur travail. Pour prendre l'exemple de la France, dans la derniere statistique, 58 % des entreprises indiquent qu'elles rencontrent de serieuses difficultes de recrutement, alors meme que le ~ux de chomage s'eleve encore a 8,8 %. Il serait done favorable a la croissance et a la creation d'emplois de recourir plus largement aux heures supplementaires dans les secteurs ou il y a penurie demontree de main-d'reuvre . Plus generalement, !'augmentation du taux d'emploi, en Europe, de 61 % aujourd'hui a 70 % dans dix ans decidee par le Conseil europeen de Lisbonne de maniere a augmenter la population disponible pour le travail, est tres opportune et revelatrice d'un changement profond d'attitude. - enfm, rechercher activement les progres de productivite qui sont a la source meme de la croissance economique, en etant ouvert au progres technique, a la revolution numerique, aux nouvelles technologies de ,,,, !'information et de la communication, de la biotechnologie, des sciences des materiaux. Cette ouverture a l'egard du progres technique et des progres rapides de productivite - manifestee en particulier par les derniers Conseils europeens - est l'une des cles du maintien d'une faible inflation et de la longevite d'une croissance robuste et durable. - Le diagnostic du Conseil des Gouverneurs de l'Eurosysteme enfin. Je resumerai notre diagnostic du 11 avril dernier expose par Wim Duisenberg en quatre phrases de la maniere suivante : ""La croissance de la masse monetaire M3 s'inscrit sur une tendance au ralentissement depuis le printemps 2000 : mesures sur la masse monetaire --les risques a la hausse pour la stabilite des prix ont diminue au cours -des derniers mois. S'agissant de !'ensemble des autres indicateurs precurseurs d'inflation, les risques a la hausse pour la stabilite des prix se sont aussi legerement reduits ces derniers mois, mais non pas disparus. L'une des contributions essentielles du Conseil des Gouvemeurs de la Banque Centrale Europeenne a la croissance de la demande inteme et done a une croissance economique robuste et durable en Europe est la credibilite de la stabilite des prix aux yeux des consommateurs : il n'y a done pas contradiction mais complementarite entre notre vigilance mise au service de la stabilite et la croissance"". C'est ainsi que nous avons done laisse inchange notre reglage de la politique monetaire le 11 avril. Dois-je enfin rappeler que nous nous reunissons regulierement et que nous examinons !'ensemble des donnees monetaires financieres et economiques ,,., ( ( de la zone dans le cadre d'un processus de decision particulierement transparent. Je vous remercie de votre attention. ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2001_04_30.json","30.04.2001","C I Speech by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France THE EURO AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS European Institute Washington, 30 April 2001 Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be invited to speak today at the European Institute, today in Washington. I am happy to express my views on the success of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you know, within eight months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will be tangible for everybody across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. Then, a decisive event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market and it contributes to ensure lasting prosperity in Europe not only for our benefit but for the benefit of the rest of the world as well. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the necessary conditions and prospects for protecting and reinforcing this success in the future. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, it is useful to point out that from a technical point of view, the launch of the euro has been an indisputable success. Together, the European Central Bank and National Central Banks of the euro area have achieved the objectives they were assigned in three important respects: - The first is operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and the steering of short-term interest rates; - The second is the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem for interbank operations and large-value payments. The integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the creation of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1,100 billion euros daily, of which 40% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - And the third objective attained is the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work rr conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial 2 r(C market operators. b/ Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has _contrib_uted to the high credibility of the single monetary policy which is guaranteed, mter aha, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several _de~ades by the national central banks. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And in the other euro-area countries, the level of confidence towards the respective National Central Banks is certainly just as high. It should be remembered that, contrary to what has often been said, Europe's monetary union did not start from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two-thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, and had never had to be re-aligned within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is coupled with the acknowledged efficiency of the operational framework. In this respect, the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem relies on the principle of decentralization asserted in the Maastricht Treaty. The Eurosystem is a team, a European monetary team, composed of the European Central Bank and the National Central Banks of the-now twelve-euro-area countries, as we welcomed a new member, the Bank of Greece, on the 1st of January 2001. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and a captain and the NCBs as the players on the field in daily contact with market participants. We all share the same team spirit, and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. cl Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. By virtue of this announcement, we provide a clear yardstick against which the public can judge the performance of our monetary policy. At this stage, may I recall briefly the main principles of the European monetary policy which are sometimes unknown or not well understood. The Eurosystem monetary policy strategy aims to create the best monetary framework for economic growth by ensuring price stability in a medium term perspective. So, a prominent feature of the Eurosystem monetary policy approach is that it does not aim to fine-tune economic developments. Price stability is a yardstick for wage moderation, a crucial element for maintaining competitiveness. A sound competitive position is conducive to a balanced 3 (' and sustainable growth and creates favourable conditions for low market interest rates. To design the effective framework of such a policy, European central bankers have faced uncertainties surrounding either the economic structures of the euro area or the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within these structures. For this reason, we have adopted a ""full information"" approach, which encompasses not only all the relevant information, but also takes into account interpretations that may differ. This monetary policy strategy, which is illustrated by our so-called two ""pillars"", differs in some respects from the strategies pursued by other central banks. In recognition of the fundamentally monetary origins of inflation over the medium term, we have assigned a prominent role to money, which constitutes the first ""pillar'' of our monetary strategy. This pillar is based on the announcement of a reference value-which we have set at a maximum of 4.5%-for annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3. Last December, we confirmed this growth rate of 4.5 % for M3. It is an important factor for stabilising expectations. This first pillar differs from traditional ""monetary targeting"", since the concept of a reference value implies that the Eurosystem is not compelled mechanistically to correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. The definition of a reference value for M3 is consistent with and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. However, monetary developments cannot be the only guide for assessing risks to price stability. We also need to review a comprehensive set of early indicators on future inflation whether it deals with present consumer prices, production prices, unit labor costs, commodity prices, exchange rates, aggregate demand, etc. Therefore, in parallel with the analysis of monetary developments, we also evaluate a wide range of other economic and financial indicators, which constitute the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy. This ""two pillars concept"" differs from so-called ""inflation targeting"", not only because we have assigned a prominent role to money but also because we do not want to be a prisoner of a single mathematical model to foresee future CPI evolution. In brief, we consider that central banks should not base their monetary policy decisions upon any single indicator, model or simple policy rule. Therefore, our two-pillar strategy constitutes a very convenient framework in which to correlate monetary developments with non-monetary factors when assessing risks to price stability. I would also like to stress that our two-pillar approach represents a balance between the requirements of clarity and simplicity on the one hand, and openness and honesty on the other . Furthermore, this strategy ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks. This appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the relatively low yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros confirm that markets have confidence and that the Eurosystem has protected the legacy of credibility it has inherited. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, 4 immediately after the Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The conference begins with a clear account of the diagnosis of the Governing Council, which is immediately posted in real time on the ECB website. May I remind you that the Eurosystem was the first central bank to introduce, on the 1st of January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates just how unfair some criticisms are! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other important central banks decided to follow in our footsteps . Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy or, as is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, and those of the Governors of the National Central Banks to their respective national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Tirelessly explaining the reasons and reasoning that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective task. This intertwining between the communication of the European monetary team and that of the European and national institutions to society as a whole is currently underestimated . Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels at least as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. And each national governor is responsible for disseminating the same message from the Eurosystem in his own language. This means that the Eurosystem's message is expressed in eleven different languages and received through the filter of eleven different cultures . To improve its transparency and communication even further, for the first time in December 2000 the Eurosystem decided to publish Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. This is why I believe that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main f central banks in the world in terms of central bank accountability in a democratic society: namely the central bank's duty to explain, justify, and whenever possible, convince and, in any case, be fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for the decisions taken. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptical people, in the United States as well as in Europe and around the world, that the euro was really going to be implemented. Many observers pointed to its alleged contradictions and inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries were too large for a viable monetary union and a viable single monetary policy. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to asymmetric shocks and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real labour force mobility. The conclusion was that the euro and the single monetary policy would never exist! The facts have disproved 5 this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy has some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. How can we respond to this very important question? First of ~II, I must firmly stress that the Governing Council formulates a single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. Each Governor is fully independent within the C~uncil, ignores any national bias and deliberates and decides according to th~ economic and monetary situation of the entire euro area. Of course, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not seem very large, in comparison with your experience here, in the United States, which is a long-standing monetary union of comparable size. Data on major US cities show that inflation differentials have been very substantial at times. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices leads to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samue/son effect. According to the IMF, this effect could have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity and standard of living. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union: for example, in the United States in 2000, the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector were USO 546 at the national level, but USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we will witness the increasing integration of European countries and more and more synchronised economic developments in the area. Indeed, several academics have demonstrated that business cycles are becoming more correlated across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether Economic Monetary Union can be a success without enhanced political union. De facto, for EMU to function well, all Member States are aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. So, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies. By the way, this co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which requests from Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Of course, this economic co-ordination must observe the independence of the ECB and of the Eurosystem strictly. Even more importantly, the euro zone has institutional mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix : The Stability and Growth Pact includes important fiscal requirements for Member States. For my part, I would like to mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: 6 - First, by providing for fiscal policy co-ordination among the Member States of Monetary Union, the Pact ensures a good policy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and, thus, cannot present a significant federal budget. Close mutual supervision and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ministries of finance within the framework of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. A suitable ""policy mix"" balance in the euro area as a whole is achieved by remaining below the 3% budget deficit threshold and adhering to the medium-term objective of keeping budgets ""close to balance or in surplus"". - Second, thanks to the dissuasive effects of a penalty system for excessive deficits, the Pact helps prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium - in terms of interest rates - as a result of other economies' bad management. - Finally, the Stability and Growth Pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State's economy. By requiring that governments aim for a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ·the Pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase in the case of specific problems in the country without, however, exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it actually allows them to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic activity that can be drawn upon to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during less favourable circumstances. Now, it is interesting to refer to the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory which has sometimes been called upon by economists who criticised EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks. I would like to point out, firstly, that one of the most remarkable effects of European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a unilateral increase in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not necessarily be the best way to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied as well to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove any more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the United States. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to confirm and enhance the success of the euro in the medium and long term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. ri-· 11.1. The euro and the single market 7 . al The euro allows to achieve the construction of the single market. Its purpose 1s to enable the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market transparency and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of co~sumers. But the _ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while ~onetary barriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, m a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises - that is already the case since the 1st January 1999 - but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like you do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market is amongst the most dynamic in the world : second behind the American market with operations totalling over 900 billion euros in 2000. The single monetary policy has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on medium and long-term capital markets; it offers euro-area financial markets participants more opportunities and better conditions for investment and financing : - Since the 1st of January 1999, cross-border money market transactions have increased to more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of this market. The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement, which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, which has become deeper and more integrated and standardised . This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the impressive growth of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro-area money market have encouraged companies to concentrate their euro cash management activity within the euro area in order to benefit from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, that is, the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro-area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the long-term capital markets, progress towards integration h~s been significant too, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. According to recent statistics, the euro may have been, together with the dollar, a 8 rr r r • leading currency for bond issuance in the first quarter of 2001, around 45% of international bond issuance for each currency. Furthermore, the removal of exchange-rate risk has encouraged European investors to substantially diversify their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. In addition, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses and other such organisations. Without the single monetary policy, would the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges have ever merged, creating EURONEXT? Indisputably, the introduction of the euro has prompted very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.7 trillion euros at the end of 2000, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure partially reflects the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective, stated by the European Council at its meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of speeding up the completion of the internal market for financial services and of setting a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets and welcomes the ensuing Regulation recently adopted by the EU Council in Stockholm. We are convinced that the implementation of these policy guidelines will contribute to better allocation of capital in the European economy and to developments in securities markets that are consistent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in Europe, in all non-financial domains: a single currency facilitates the full comparability of prices, taxes and earnings. It could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practices through reinforced co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. This is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies as one of the fields where co-ordination should be reinforced. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. Emphasis was placed on deepening the single market; indicators were set to enable comparisons of best practices among the Member States; and it was decided to include a close examination of the structural issues in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. All these developments are heading in the right direction. The recent Stockholm European Council confirmed these orientations and even added key issues, such as ageing in the EU and the role of biotechnology for European economic growth. 9 ( r r All European countries must resolutely carry on with the structural reforms they hav~ alread_y launched. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in p~rt,cular _with_ regard to the implementation of the single market. However, Europe is still experiencing unacceptably high levels of unemployment, although the jobless rate declined significantly in most economies over the past three years. According to the IMF, the OECD and Central Banks, around 75% of unemployment appears to be structural i.e. generated by an environment that hampers job creation. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a smoothly functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to the general environment, as regards their competitiveness, in choosing a particular location in the euro area. The investment localisation process in the euro area will provide a strong incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be placed on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy management involved, in particular, monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign-exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities received a constant flow of data on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. Conversely, with a single currency, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on the radar screens of foreign-exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers have to monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. From now on, the sanctions for economic policy errors will come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. Market economy rules continue to apply to each euro-area economy. Jobs are created by consumers, who are entirely free to buy what they want, when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen, who are entirely free to select their investments, create these jobs at the best possible locations according to their relative competitiveness. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before, especially through the unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance provided for in the context of the Eurogroup -namely the twelve Ministers of Finance of the euro area countries (a member of the European Commission and the President of the ECB are also invited)- should enable us to monitor competitiveness trends in each individual euro-area economy as well as throughout the area and to suggest, where necessary, the appropriate corrections. * * * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem on monetary and economic developments. 10 ' First, as regards growth: European central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with regard to economic growth. On the contrary, they are very much in favour of growth, first and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy itself -price stability - is paving the way for medium-and long-term sustainable robust growth. There are three main channels through which price stability is fostering growth. First, maintaining and reinforcing the competitiveness of the productive sector through low inflation, and so, wage moderation, and therefore low unit production costs. Second, reinforcing savers' confidence in the ability of monetary and financial instruments to maintain the value of their savings in the long run, therefore allowing for low-, medium- and long-term market interest rates. And, finally, fostering domestic demand by preserving households' purchasing power through low inflation. This last contribution to growth is particularly important at present in the euro area. By boosting the Europeans' confidence in the ability of the Eurosystem to deliver price stability, we preserve consumer confidence and, therefore, we contribute to maintain and reinforce the level of consumer demand. The Eurosystem contributes to a sustainable, non-inflationary, steady medium-term growth not only through central bank monetary policy aiming at price stability but also via all its recommendations. The objective of sustainable, non-inflationary, steady growth, which could force unemployment down to its low tidemark, will be achieved more easily if Europe resolutely adopts an open-minded attitude towards the ""factors of production"" - i.e. labour, investment and technical progress - which are the wellspring of growth. For some time, a persistent high unemployment, the structural causes of which were not well understood, led Europe to adopt Malthusian attitudes, such as a wariness towards technical progress, which was seen as a potential factor of job destruction, a cautious attitude towards productivity-enhancing investment, which was thought to contribute to higher unemployment, and efforts to reduce the available work force in order to curtail unemployment. Fortunately, a profound change in perspective is underway in Europe, and we are discarding certain Malthusian attitudes. This change has been prompted notably ( by the new information· and communication technologies, by the growing consensus on the necessity to augment the growth potential of the European economy through structural reforms, and by the realisation that the emergence of pre-inflationary bottlenecks could be an obstacle to growth that is robust and sustainable because it is non-inflationary. As was confirmed by the latest meetings of the European Council, there is a growing consensus that, to entrench this change in attitude, our strategy should move in three directions to: - invest actively and loosen capital constraints. Productivity and capacity investments are essential in our economy in which the capacity utilisation rate is currently at a historic high, and a large proportion of companies are experiencing production bottlenecks. - ease labour constraints and improve the functioning of labor markets. As an example, the objective set by the European Council meeting in Lisbon to increase Europe's employment rate from the current 61 % to 70% in ten years' time in order 11 ( ( to expand the available workforce is particularly timely and reveals a conceptual turning point; - lastly, actively seek productivity improvements, which lie at the very heart of economic growth by embracing technical progress, the digital revolution, the new information and communication technologies, biotechnology and material sciences. This openness to technical progress and rapid productivity enhancement, which was very much in evidence at the last European Council meetings, is one of the keys to maintaining low inflation and robust and sustainable growth. Let me finally try to sum up the diagnosis that the governing council of the ECB worked out in its last Thursday's meeting and which was explained by Wim DUISENBERG on the occasion of the G VII meeting. Our monetary considerations are based on two ""pillars"": the evolution of the monetary aggregate M3 and its counterparts on the one hand, and the synthetic observation of a full set of early indicators of future inflation on the other. As regards monetary aggregates, we have observed during the last months and until now, a progressive diminishing of the pace of gorwth of M3 which suggests that the assessments of risks to price stability are more balanced than before. As regards the second pillar, there is the slowing down of external demand triggered by the slowing down of the US economy, but continued vigilance is appropriate, due, in particular, to the evolution of wages and salaries and the necessity to avoid the possible second-round effects of the present inflationary pressures stemming from oil price increases and the low level of the euro. This being said, we are pragmatic, we are relying on objective data, on facts and figures, and we are assessing the situation at each of our meetings. I do not want to repeat myself. But I think that the ECB is bringing about a very important contribution to growth of domestic demand in Europe by fostering consumer confidence in ensuring credible medium-term price stability. Thank you for your attention. 12 ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2001_05_11.json","11.05.2001","Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EURO : A MAJOR STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY NIKKEi Euro Symposium LONDON 5 November 2001 La_dies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here today, at the Nikkei Euro Symposium, in front of such a distinguished audience. I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the launch of the notes and coins, which will be a reality within 8 weeks The economic and financial ties· between Europe and Japan have been strengthened significantly over the recent period : European investors and companies have . stepped up their market presence in Japan these last two years ; likewise, Japanese foreign direct investments in the Euro area and _Japanese portfolio investments in euro since January 1999 have highlighted the confidence in the European single currency. I would - like to explain _YhY the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and the conditions and prospects for building on this achievement. I will then discuss the historical event of the introduction of banknotes and coins at the end of this year. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POL.ICY, AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1 The euro is based on a credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) I would like to point out that, from a technical point of view; the launch of the euro on financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success, and that the Eurosystem, made up of the ECB and the National _ Central Banks of the euro area, has fully achieved the objectives assigned to it in the following. areas: - operational efficiency, highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market became integrated in early January 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. 3 l - and, finally, the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, which is an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the ir:nplementation of operations. b) Together with many other factors, this technical and operational succe~s has contributed to the high level of credibility of the single monetary policy which is based, in particular, on the independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks, and on the store of confidence inherited from the latter. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, European Monetary Union did not start from scratch. For no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the twelve currencies which now make up the euro - and represent almost two thirds of euro-area GDP - had proven remarkably stable, and were not realigned within the ERM. This high degree of confidence also stems from the acknowledged effi~iency of the operational set-up of the Eurosystem, which is based on the principle of decentralisation stipulated in the Treaty. The Eurosystem is a team. The European monetary team now comprises the ECB and the national central banks of twelve Member States, following the Bank of Greece's entry on 1 January 2001. All the members of the Eurosystem work in close co-operation. c) The credibility of the Eurosystem lies, fundamentally, in its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by providing a clear definition of price stability: that is to say a year~on-year 4 increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of the euro area of below 2%. The aim of the single monetary policy is to ensure medium-term price stability, therefore creating a favourable monetary and financial environment for economic growth. Price stability offers an anchor for wage negotiators, and is a necessary factor for competitiveness, which is in turn essential for achieving balanced and therefore sustainable economic growth. The euro area is however a complex financial and economic zone. For this reason, we have adopted a broader-based approach, taking into account all relevant data. We have thus based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". In view of the monetary origins of inflation in the medium term, we have assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3, which constitutes the first ""pillar"" of our monetary policy strategy. This pillar is based on a reference value which we .set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. This monetary indicator is regarded as being the most compatible with medium-term price stability. Last December, we confirmed this 4.5% growth .rate for M3. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short ·term. The reference value of M3 is consistent with lasting price stability. Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the ec~nomy and capital flows with the rest of the world. However, trends in monetary aggregates are not in themselves sufficient for assessing the risks to price stability. This is why we need an exhaustive description of the prevailing economic and financial situation. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is based on a broad range of variables acting as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments. 5 Our monetary strategy ensures a continuity from the monetary policies previously conducted by the national central banks, which now belong to the Eurosystem. This strategy has been well received by fina.ncial markets and the general public. In particular, the relatively low yields on long-term · euro-denominated bonds confirm that the Eurosystem has retained the credibility store it inherited. d) Lastly, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts in terms of transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the ECB . Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference which starts with a precise report of the assessment of the Governing Council, and which is made available in real time on the ECB website. The Eurosystem was the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Other major central banks have since decided to follow us. Being accountable, for an independent institution in a modern democracy -or, as it is · the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle constellation of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to public opinion. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, as well as those by the Governors of National Central Banks to the attention of national Institutions and public opinion, are of vital significance. Indeed, a crucial part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the 6 reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Governing Counc;:il. In December 2000, the Eurosystem decided to release, for the first time, its euro area economic staff projections, with a view to improving transparency and communication. Thus, from the point of view of the accountability of the central bank in a democratic society - that is to say the duty to explain, justify, convince, whenever. possible, and take full responsibility vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken -, the Eurosystem strives to meet the highest standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2 The euro significantly contributes to growth in Europe by enhancing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics, in Europe as weU as in the rest of the world, that the euro would really be launched. Many observers believed that the single monetary policy would never succeed ! Facts have disproved this conclusion. However, other observers still sometimes evoke the supposed fragility of the euro area stemming from the supposed economic and structural divergences between euro area countries. How can we answer this important question? Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating c.ountries will have the same rate of inflatioff or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us take inflation for example. Inflation divergences across countries or regions are quite natural in a monetary union. 7 In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices naturally gives rise to different inflation rates across countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence. Now, present differentials in the Euro area are not very large, in _comparison with those sometimes observed in the United States, which is a long established monetary union of comparable size. My intimate conviction is that we will witness further European integration and, in the medium term, an increasing correlation of economic developments in the area. Several academic studies show that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly, the question has often been· raised as to whether EMU. can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, to achieve this, the correct mix is required between fiscal, economic and monetary policies. In the European Union, Member States are responsible for conducting economic and fiscal policies. We therefore believe that these policies should be closely co-ordinated. Co-ordination is stressed in the · Treaty itself, which requests that Member .States treat national economic policies uas a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Naturally, this economic co-ordination can in no way undermine the independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem. Even more importantly, the euro area possesses institutional mechanisms which are conducive to an appropriate policy mix: the Stability and Growth Pact includes, on the part of the Member States, strict fiscal requirements. I will cite three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by keeping a rein on the fiscal policies of the EMU Member States, the Pact ensures a satisfactory policy mix within the euro area. This is essential 8 r for monetary policy, in order to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and hence no significant ""federal"" budget. Mutual surveillance and close co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Eurogroup"" and of the Ecofin Council. Keeping the deficit below 3% of GDP, and achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the euro area. - Second, the Pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium on interest rates, resulting from the poor management of other EMU economies, by_ setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the Stability and Growth Pact disproves the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to allow budget deficits to increase during periods of specific national difficulties without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it enables countries to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic conditions. This buffer can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during economic downturns. But of course, the extent to which Governments can let automatic stabilisers play strictly depends on the initial level of the fiscal balance; obviously ·countries which still have fiscal deficits have less room than countries with budgets close to balance or in surplus. 9 II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was broadly successful, one may ask, at this juncture, what the conditions are for the full and ongoing success of the euro in the medium and long term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that, in a number of areas, the euro in itself appears to be a catalyst for meeting these conditions. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market a) The euro makes the completion of the single market possible. It enables the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, and all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. However, the ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while monetary ba""rriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will b~ the euro cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only companies but all our citizens to enjoy all the benefits of using the same monetary instrument throughout Europe, just like Americans do today with the dollar throughout the United States. · b) Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong .catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M&A market has been in 2000 one of the most dynamic in. the world with operations totalling around one trillion euro. ( The single monetary policy encourages structural changes in the financial sector, in both the euro area money market and longer-term capital markets. This gives euro area investors greater possibilities and improved financing and investment conditions. - From the beginning of January 1999, cross-border money market transactions increased sharply, to reach almost two-thirds 0f total activity on all money market segments. The unsecured deposit interbank market -which is mainly concentrated on the shortest maturities- is highly integrated. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored; EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have prompted market participants to concentrate their euro cash management activity in order to take advantage of the higher liquidity levels on the secondary market. Needless to say, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets · and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. - · As regards stock markets and bond markets, major progress has been made in terms of integration. According to recent statistics, the euro, together with the dollar, appears to have been a major bond issuance currency in the firs·t semester of 2001, with the euro accounting for close to 40% of total issuance. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios 11 since · the introduction of the euro, prompted by the removal · of the · exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve better performances for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to current trends in mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement · systems, clearing houses, and similar institutions. Had the ·euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges merge to create EURONEXT and recently conclude another major alliance? Undeniably, the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan may be implemented by 2005 ; a . regular review of this Plan is made by European authorities, and progress is well under way. The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securities markets, ratified by the ~uropean Council meeting in Stockholm in March 2001: we are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help to improve capital allocation in .Europe and foster developments on equity markets in line with monetary policy requirements. 11.2. The euro is an incentive for further structural reforms a) . The euro, per se, is also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe: a single currency facilitates the comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. The euro could encourage ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States' structural 12 C policies in areas such as the labour market, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. For this reason, the European Council, meeting in · Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council further enhanced the medium-term strategy necessary for structural reform in the Union. The following developments are a step in the right direction: the emphasis ~n deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which will examine the structural issues closely. The recent European Council meetings in Stockholm in March 2001 and Gothenburg in June 2001 confirmed these guidelines and even added a number of important issues such as the consequences of the ageing population in the European Union, the role of biotechnologies in econom~c growth, and the environment. The European Heads of State and Government, meeting in Ghent a couple of weeks ago, called for an acceleration of the whole process. All Europ·ean countries must resolutely pursue the reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that much has already been done, in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is stiU experiencing levels of un~mployment that are too high, despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been declining · significantly in most of its economies for the past three years. According to the IMF, the OECD and central bani(s, 75% of unemployment is of a structural nature, .i.e. generated by an environment which handicaps job creation. There is no doubt that EMU stimulates structural reforms on the labour market. With increased capi~al mobility and the smooth functioning of the single market, firms will become · increasingly sensitive to the general · environment in terms of their competitiveness when choosing a particular 13 C location in the euro area. The actual process of selecting an investment location within the euro area will be a . major incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b) Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be · placed on competitive .ness. Pre-euro economic policy required careful monitoring of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The . authorities received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could then react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. At present, with the advent of the single currency, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance, as economic policy errors could have slower and more insidious repercussions, such as rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy continue to apply to all euro area countries .. Jobs are created by consumers - totally free to purchase whatever they wish - when they choose the goods and services that they deem to be best value for money. Companies - totally free in their investment choices -locate their business according to the relative competitiveness of the different possible sites. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before, in particular unit production costs, and the tax and reguiatory framework. The multilateral surveillance carried out in the context of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competition trends in each euro area country and in the zone as a whole and, where necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. 14 ,. l Ill. A SMOOTH CHANGEOVER TO THE EURO WILL ALSO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR FOR EUROPEANS' CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CURRENCY Of course, the Eurosystem is at the heart of the euro cash changeover process. Our challenge consists in replacing all national monetary units by the euro in all monetary and financial relations of public administrations, banks, enterprises, businesses and citizens. The first contribution of the Eurosystem is the euro banknote production. Today, more than 12 billion banknotes have been manufactured, out of a total of 14.9 billion. The launch stock is almost ready. The manufacturing process has been carefully monitored, in accordance with state of the art security standards. The new banknotes combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro. These security features provide all persons handling cash, especially the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes. Special attention has also been. given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted. The Eurosystem also plays a key role in the supplying process of euro banknotes and in the withdrawing process of former national monetary units. At the national level, each central bank of the euro area works in close co-operation with credit institutions, security companies, shopkeepers and police forces. This fruitful concertation is essential to the success of such a huge operation, on both fields of logistics and security. 15 The ""non-cash"" euro is already in use The final stage of the introduction of the euro will include two changeovers: the changeover to the non-cash euro,· which concerns all book-entry tran$actions (cheques, bank accounts, bank card payments, transfers,· loans, etc.) and the changeover to the cash euro, which concerns banknotes and coins. This summer, banks in France started to systematically convert bank accounts into euros and provide customers with euro cheque books. In various participating countries, in · particular France, all bank accounts have already been converted . It is now up to each citizen in the euro area to establish a new scale of values for the currency and to make payments in euro. In this respect, retailers have a fundamental role to play: their active participation · and their readiness to accept payments in euro will greatly facilitate the euro changeover as a whole. The cash euro will be in circulation within 8 weeks As regards the cash euro, the main task now consists in frontloading the banknotes and coins so that, on 1 January 2002, transactions can be carried out smoothly in the best possible security conditions. To achieve this, · frontloaded coins are supplied to credit institutions. Banknotes will soon be provided to them (as of 1 December in France). Retailers will also be provided with frontloaded banknotes and coins. Furthermore, in order to familiarise the public and to facilitate the giving of change as of 1 January 2002, individuals. will be able to obtain, as of mid-December, packs of euro . coins known as 'euro starter kits' ; these coins cannot be· used for payments before 1st January 2002. 16 As of 1 January 2002, banks will only i deliver euros, retailers will give change in euro and ATMs will supply euro banknotes only. A few days after this date, almost all transactions will be carried out in euro. Beyond technical aspects, the Eurosystem -and also public authorities- have an important responsibility in informing the general public on the challenges ahead, the deadlines and the practical aspects of the euro cash changeover. The success of the global process depends heavily on the confidence of the general public and cash handlers as well. Preparing people.to be well informed. and to feel confident in using the euro banknotes and coins is the overall (~ objective of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign conducted by the Eurosystem. This campaign aims to reach the general public through the mass media. It is closely supported by a Europe-wide Partnership Programme with more than 2 600 national and international organisations. It has now entered into an intensive information phase, since the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features by our President, W. Duisenberg, on 30th of August. As Mr Duisenberg stressed, this event was more than a mere technical presentation, but took on an historical and symbolic dimension. On 1 January 2002, we will have the honour of witnessing the largest currency changeover that the world has ever experienced. This will be the crowning achievement of a long economic and political process which led to the creation of Monetary Union . on 1 January 1999. This unique event in European history will help to ensure lasting prosperity, which is not only in Europe's interest but that of the rest of the world as well. * * * 17 Lastly, speaking in front . of bankers, financial institutions, business executives and journalists, I would like to make the following remarks as regards the present situation: -first, the main message in the present exceptional circumstances, is that the first quality of all Institutions, all economic leaders, all enterprises as well as households is to keep one's nerves. The best gift we could give the terrorists would be to change our plans, to cancel endeavours, to delay decisions, to reduce investment or consumption. We, Institutions, enterprises, individuals had and have projects: let us realize them, in time, and unchanged. -second, let us beware of fashion. It was still fashionable, a year ago, to embark ·on vibrant eloge of the new economy, to predict the end of the business cycle and to forecast for ever very high level of productivity progress and buoyant economic growth. To-day some kind of herd behaviour drives a lot of observers and actors in the opposite direction: overwhelming pessimism as regards the present situation and the economic future. Both attitudes are equally totally . inappropriate. It is up to the Central Banks to remain moderate in _their judgments, pragmatic and lucid in the various circumstances and to offer r an anchor not only for monetary and financial stability but also for stability of judgment -third, fostering confidence is a major contribution of the Eurosystem to the prosperity of the European economy. Confidence is a very preciou~ ingredient in the present European conjuncture, as recently emphasized by the European Council in Ghent : confidence in the euro, in price stability, in its ability to be a highly reliable instrument for savings, in its medium and long term solidity. Confidence of the consumers ·in price stability underpins growth through dynamic household consumption - which is today a m?jor motor of economic 18 -growth. Confidence of the . savers underpins growth through a favourable financial environment. Thank you very much for your attention. • 19 ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2001_05_16.json","16.05.2001","') Keynote address by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France at the OECD FORUM 2001 on Sustainable Development and the New Economy May 16, 2001 Preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be invited today to this OECD Forum to talk about preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. One should keep in mind that financial globalisation has brought about improved macro-economic efficiency. As you know, the globalisation of the world economy and the development of financial markets were driven by two key factors: - firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced in Europe by the setting up of the single market and subsequently of the Economic and Monetary Union- which liberalised capital flows and enhanced competition among financial sectors; - and secondly, technical and financial innovation, which simultaneously paved the way for the creation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected. What is interesting to stress is that the interaction of free capital movements within interconnected markets, increasing integration of market segments and hedging opportunities provided by new financial instruments have allowed a better fit between the financing capacities and borrowing requirements of both governments, households and companies . The use of market interest rates, which represent the markets' consensus on the risk incurred at a moment, as a driving force is fully beneficial to an efficient allocation of capital. Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercer competition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of pure and perfect competition, which is beneficial to all consumers. Last but not least, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled directly into investment. Reducing the share of bank financing, and consequently that of money creation, has enabled a less inflationary financing of the economy. Thus increased, monetary stability has produced tangible and positive effects and contributed decisively t~ a strong and sustainable growth of the world economy. Thus, these developments have resulted in increased monetary stability and a more efficient allocation of resources. However, while globalisation and financial integration have decisively contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, experience also suggests that financial cycles may have tended to amplify relative to business cycles over recent years. In particular, financial markets have experienced in some circumstances somewhat erratic developments. The rapid emergence of the ""new economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000- followed by a series of sharp corrections- illustrated the potential of markets for providing funding to the real economy (particularly to the most innovative sectors); but it also demonstrated the tendency of markets to over-react, moving from excessive optimism to disproportionate pessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for the behaviour of firms and households. As a result, financial authorities have been confronted with boom-bust episodes which must be carefully monitored, since they could affect global monetary and financial stability. I would like therefore to consider two issues here: ¦ Firstly , experience suggests that financial cycles may have recently tended to amplify relative to business cycles; what are the driving factors behind this move; ¦ Secondly , what are the possible policy implications of this development, from both a monetary and financial stability perspective. 1. Experienc e suggests that financial cycles have recently tended to ampli fy relative to business cycles. A. What are the major f eatures of these amplified financial cycles? Let us first consider credit cycles. There is no doubt that the amplitude of credit cycles is usually larger than that of business cycles. What is however noticeable here is that, over the last three decades, business cycles have been less frequent and less amplified while credit cycles have tended to remain fairly marked. Thus credit cycles have been amplifying in relative terms compared with business cy cles. Asset price cycles have also become more pronounced even if the fixed interest rate markets have a tendency to be somewhat contra-cyclical. ¦ In the last two decades market forces have indeed tended to cause clear misalignments between equilibrium and actual asset prices . Stock markets in particular have experienced this phenomenon. But in foreign exchange markets as -2 well, prices have also tended to diverge substantially from their ""equilibrium level"", although those divergences have been contained through fruitful GVII cooperation during the last 15 years. • In addition, some markets have seen an increase in volatility and frequent volatility peaks. Although cyclical moves should be clearly distinguished from volatility, the latter may in some circumstances exceed what can be considered optimal, making the price determination mechanism less efficient and thus contributing to misalignments. • Moreover, as demonstrated by a number of financial crises during the last two decades, contagion among countries and across financial markets has been frequent. As a result, investors have faced asset price fluctuations that might be more synchronised than before. • Lastly, the connections between credit, asset price and business cycles have tended to amplify cyclical swings. Credit, in particular, has played an increasing role in asset price fluctuations. Initially observed during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted. Another example is provided by boom-bust cycles in asset prices and credit activities, which have often been associated with sharp economic contractions. · In sum, the recent period has experienced some amplification of financial cycles, compared with business cycles. B. What are the factors underlying this possible amplification of financial cycles? Let us first consider credit cycles : • the first factor in play is the behaviour of banks, which is closely linked to their environment. Some of them may have tended to artificially increase their return on equity through higher leverage or low provisioning during upswings. As a consequence they tend to become more fragile in the downward phase of the cycle. In parallel, investors have become more reluctant to invest in the banking sector when profit expectations are low, making it difficult for banks to raise new funds. Banks' soundness therefore tends to be more correlated to economic fluctuations than in the past, contributing to the amplification of the credit cycle. • Accounting regulations so far may also contribute to amplifying credit cycles to some extent. In most financial centres, current provisioning behaviour does not allow hanks to take a forward-looking view of their risks, as accounting and tax rules only accept loan-loss provisions for impaired loans. Such a regulatory environment may amplify the credit cycle, contributing to low provisioning and over-lending during upswings and paving the way to sharp corrections during 3 downswings. Using full fair value accounting for loan portfolios might further amplify credit cycles by increasing the volatility of banks' earnings. • Prudential rules may also have been unable so far to always prevent these developments. Current capital adequacy rules are not risk-sensitive; as a result, credit deterioration does not require additional regulatory capital unless loan losses erode the capital base under minimum requirements. As most banks -particularly large ones- have capital far beyond the prudential minimum requirements, they can bear a reduction of their capital base without being compelled to restrict their credit granting. Therefore, capital ratio is not pro-cyclical as such. The point is that, even while capital requirements are fulfilled, losses can reduce banks' own funds at a time when capital issuance is difficult or costly; in such a juncture, some analysts argue that banks may be led to restrict credit lending during downswings although they are not bound to do so for prudential reasons. I consider that the future capital requirements of the New Accord will significantly improve the situation as regards the risk-sensitivity of capital requirements. Let us now turn to asset price moves. As previously mentioned, financial asset prices may fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals for long periods of time. Several factors may be in play when this happens. I shall give a few examples. • Some market participants may have become more inclined to engage in ""short-termism"", that is, they are only preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield high immediate financial results that are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market financial products may also have contributed to this widespread focus on immediate financial performances. This focus on short-term performance can translate into additional volatility in the price discovery process: the shorter the investment horizon of market participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. ¦ Mimetic · behaviour is of course by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. Technological developments on markets may however have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour, as participants are increasingly incited to follow their peers through matching the performance of a benchmark. There is no doubt that the spread of benchmarking allows fund managers and clients to better assess their performance against that of other funds. But, in a context of growing competition within the sector, it may well have increased mimetic behaviour. Some economic operators (whose own compensation is closely linked to the relative, rather than absolute, profit and losses they generate) may indeed have come to the conclusion that it would be better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than running the risk of being wrong alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. 4 • Another factor to be taken into consideration is the spectacular development of certain fund management techniques, such as index management. As it has proven very popular on equity markets, index management may have contributed to exacerbating movements in financial asset prices. Because their goal is to mimic the performance of indexes, ""passive managers"" try constantly to match the composition of their benchmark. They thus help to amplify market trends, buying more as the market rises and liquidating more as the market drops. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indexes and that, as a result, the indices end up creating rather than measuring performance. • Last but not least, the impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting . Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standard approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and to set up exposure limits. Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments. But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of sophisticated risk management techniques by financial intermediaries might have had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock, exhausting liquidity and contributing to contagion phenomena. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, we see that their growing use may have produced pernicious effects. When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All those factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 2. Possible policy implications of such developments from a monetary and a financial stability perspective All the factors I have just mentioned require authorities to consider - in conjunction with the financial industry - ways of preserving monetary and financial stability in this changing environment. A. A stability-oriented monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite for the smooth functioning of financial cycles. Financial deregulation has radically changed the conduct of monetary policies. More open economies and greater interdependence between financial systems have completely overhauled the context in which monetary policy is implemented. ¦ Financial markets can now penalise inflationary monetary policies by withdrawing capital, with a subsequent rise in long-term interest rates and/or depreciation of the exchange rate. -5 • At the same time, monetary policy transmission mechanisms have become more diversified and complex. This situation has prompted the authorities to separate the different instruments for implementing economic policy. In this context, monetary policy has been clearly been assigned the objective of maintaining price stability. Today, monetary policies are conducted within a framework characterised by three features: • Firstly, reducing inflation expectations depends on compliance with a number of rules that have been clearly defined in advance. Consequently, this policy can only be effective if the authority responsible for defining and implementing it is credible. The conjunction of a clear, overriding objective of price stability (which has been explicitly laid down in the statute of the ECB), with well-established institutional independence ensures the continuity of the monetary policy decisions made by the authorities. • Secondly, the emergence of a globalised market has quite naturally led to new developments in monetary policy instruments. The interest-rate instrument is overwhelmingly used to the detriment of quantitative and regulatory instruments. • Lastly, these instruments serve converging strategies. The ECB 's monetary policy framework, for instance, is based on an analysis of growth in the monetary aggregate-the EMU reference value for M3 growth is 4.5%--combined with a wide range of economic and financial indicators to monitor inflationary risks. In such a context, monetary policy acts as a stabiliser Monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which inay be jeopardised by shocks from both the financial and the real economies. However, it must be stressed that an adequate monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite to a smooth functioning of the financial cycles. An appropriate monetary stance -both in terms of interest rate and money supply- is crucial for banks and monetary participants to base their decisions on solid ground. The objective of price stability lowers economic agents' uncertainty regarding future price developments. In addition, by committing itself to a long-term objective, the central bank reduces market uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest rates and money supply are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy. However, for financial systems to be stable, monetary policy must be consistent with the other aspects of economic policy, that is, fiscal policy and structural programmes. The policy mix must be well-balanced at the international as well as the domestic levels. Placing too heavy a burden on monetary policy in terms of achieving the main economic and financial balances is detrimental to its effectiveness. In particular, it diminishes its ability to maintain and consolidate financial market stability. This concern underlies the implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact in Economic 6 r C C and Monetary Union. By obliging fiscal policies to commit to stability, the pact allows the fisc~l bu~fers to fulfil their role as stabilisers. Indeed, by their information and e~pect~tions, investors can penalise imbalances affecting the main world economies or diverging developments in different countries. To reduce this constraint economic and monetary policies must be harmonised at the international level in o;der to achieve more balanced international financial relations. B. Financial authorities have to soften as much as possible some of the side-effects of the new financial market features. Let us first consider a few possible improvements as regards credit cycles : • Provisioning standards should allow banks' lending to be less pro-cyclical. As a general rule, provisioning standards require improvements so that provisions better reflect the actual inherent credit risk of loan portfolios. They should also be improved for macroeconomic purposes, so that banks' lending behaviour becomes less pro-cyclical. These objectives could be achieved through a more forward-looking provisioning, whereby provisions are set up earlier - that is to say, in a perfect world, as soon as a loan is granted. Current accounting and tax frameworks hamper the widespread adoption of dynamic provisioning by requiring that risks on specific loans be identified prior to provisioning. Discussions among accounting standard-setters, tax authorities and regulators are essential to encourage such a reform. • Globalisation and the development of financial markets have created a real need for reliable information and harmonised accounting practices. We fully support such trends towards increased transparency. But, it is nonetheless vital to ensure that, when applied to banks, some of the new widespread accounting practices neither distort the presentation of banks' individual situations, nor disrupt their management practices. A ""full fair value"" approach assumes that a ""fair value"" can be determined for all financial instruments; but this does not necessarily apply to banking activities, since loans and deposits are essentially neither liquid nor tractable. Using the f u/1 fair value approach for the banking book might result in sharp swings in banks' earnings and prompt banks to curtail their lending activity. This approach might further amplify the credit cycle and could potentially affect financial stability. This is the reason why an increasing number of bank regulators are not in favour of this approach as regards banking book. Let now focus on asset prices moves. Financial authorities might reflect on some ways to foster behavioural diversity in financial markets. As we have seen before, a series of factors, such as short-termism, mimetic behaviour or index management, have tended to make ""contrarians"" less pro-active on financial markets. This has resulted in somewhat modified market dynamics and less efficient price determination mechanisms. In order to safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, the diversity of participants' behaviours must be _protected or even reinforced. This necessary diversity should logically reflect natural differences 7 in time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore three possible avenues for future action for both authorities and the industry. First avenue: Strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency • Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore continues to be a priority. • One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness. A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouring countries are treated in the same way -regardless of their actual economic and financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. • Transparency as substantially improved since the Asian crisis thanks to a solid global consensus. Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. Second possible avenue : Taking into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants. • Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, this type of investor are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors , who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. • To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures . This objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds and life insurance companies are assessed. In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use. It might imply that some rules and standards would be adapted to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. Third possible avenue : Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions: ¦ As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used by too many participants. To some degree, this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they took inadequate account -8 of market liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis -, such tools might tend to give conve~ging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. • Of course, the fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than th~ average is a guarantee that standardisation .will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. • However , supervisors might help, and obviously are already helping to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing . This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach . These are only examples of possible options to help improve the functioning of the financial cycles and smooth their interaction with the business cycles . There is probably some merit to embark in an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices and of structural developments of markets themselves, to identify possible amendments and improvements that could help, protect and enhance the ""behavorial and conceptual diversity of modern financial markets. 21n conclusion, let me stress the important role played by central banks in preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. ¦ The recent years have shown the benefits of monetary stability in terms of growth in a globalised world. It is of course closely linked to central banks ' independence, which is no longer a matter of debate. ¦ Financial authorities are nevertheless faced with a new challenge , which is to strengthen financial stability, in a context of amplified financial cycles, in conjunction with monetary stability. I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. ¦ Central banks have a undoubtedly special responsibility due to their position at the heart of financial systems: - they contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions gives them a thorou gh understanding of banking systems, - they are responsible for ensuring that payment systems operate smoothly, - and they contribut e to banking supervision.

Le taux d'utilisation des capacites de production, toujours superieur a sa moyenne de longue periode , s'est replie pour revenir a son niveau d'octobre 1999. j La demande globale a peu evolue. A !'exportation, le courant d'ordres en provenance des Etats-Unis et, clans une moindre mesure, de l'Asie s'est affaibli; la demande europeenne, a !'exception de celle de l'Allemagne, demeure soutenue . La demande inteme est moins affectee mais les commandes interindustrielles sont jugees moins vigoureuses en raison, notamment, du repli de certains secteurs comme la telephonie. Les carnets de commandes continuent de se reduire, particulierement dans les biens intermediaires, mais sont toujours juges correctement gamis dans l 'ensemble . Les stocks excedent legerement le niveau desire, sauf clans les industries agroalimentaires ou ils apparaissent bien adaptes. Au cours des prochains mois, l'activite devrait faiblement augmenter dans !'ensemble des secteurs. Les prix des matieres premieres comme ceux des produits finis n'ont guere varie. Les investissements programmes se realisent comme prevu . Toutefois, les responsables d'entreprise tendent plutot a privilegier !'amelioration de la productivite sur !' augmentation des capacites. L'activite commerciale s'est repliee au cours du bimestre ecoule. Elle apparait neanmoins en hausse a un an d'intervalle et la plupart des commeryants demeurent confiants pour les prochains mois. Les effectifs permanents sont restes stables dans tous les secteurs .

I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, within nine months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be - recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st -January 1999. Then, a decisive event in the history of Europe ft occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. C I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out thatj from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: 2 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 4 • operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking t liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates;. • the security provided by the procedures and systems Implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the transfer of large--value payments in real time throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system now processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1, 1 oo billion euros daily, of which 40% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. b/ 'Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success f has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. ,... I The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in the other co.untrtes. participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. 3 Fa>< re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 P9: 5 Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not i starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, . on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the ,. field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the darity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a man~ate for maintaining price stability. We . have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have-based f our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up. a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad mo.n~ aggregate M3; last December, we have confirmed this ra_te of growth of 4,5 % as an important factor for stabilising expectations. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. 4 -=---·: r Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 6 The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set -of • indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood. by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has kept intact the legacy of credibility that it has inherited. di Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's _constant e_fforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the • Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference-which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB -website. This will be the case when we will meet next Wednesday in Frankfurt. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 1st January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other t important central banks decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modem democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, In a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reast?ni~ that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective. 5 Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 7 duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the i European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so In total in ten languages), through the lens of twelve different cultures, the same message from the Eurosystem. To improve its transparency and its communication even further, the Eurosystem decided to publish for the first time in December 2000 Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. In terms of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to e)(J)lain, justify, • whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions· taken.: I think that . the Eurosystem meets the. best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to i~ pres~m~p c~ntrJq;qtiQr,~ ~nd ~lleijed inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the lack of ~o-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an . ' ' '. ,.. "" ~ppropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy contains some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very important question? 6 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 8 Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily , imply that, at any given point in time, all the particlpati~g countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence proces,. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the earty 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally i rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in 2000, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USD 437 in Mississippi and USD 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic deveh:;,pments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 r= 06/04/01 09:01 , rn this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policiest while strictly respecting the Independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies •as a matter of common Interest'' and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed , for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States o.f Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy , to counterbalance the facl that Europe does not have a significant federal budget> just as it has no federal government. Close mutual Pg: 9 . - - ; :• surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individua l countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns -which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits . - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed , by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ''close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during r,~ssions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to q.iwe a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to couA~ ~romic divergences or asymmetric shocks . 8 I '£' .. - • • . - . . • 06/04/01 09:01 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a re_sponse to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mu_ndell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: 11 If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established -monetary union such as the US. IL THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly. successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 Pg: 10 06/04/01 09:01 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be ~ made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 900 billion euros in 2000, it is now ~ catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of the money market The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the sh<?rt-term derivatives market. whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market These structural changes m the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated within the euro area their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition 10 Pg: 11 Fax re~u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 12 in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. • With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on 1he euro-denominated bond market and the equity market.. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro in 1999, against the equivalent of _902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in 1he first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued about ~ three quarters of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s .. Similarly, private borrowers residing outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. And, according to recent statistics, the euro could have been the first currency for bond issuance before the US dollar during the first quarter of 2001, with 46% of international bond issuance against 44% for US dollar. Furthermore. European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would It have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. Tbis figure reflects 11 Fax re9u de : 06/04/01 09:01 the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further Integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal mark~t for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets and welcome the ensuing Regulation recently adopted by the EU Council in Stockholm : we are convinced that the i~plementation of these policy guidelines will contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and to r developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms Pg: 13 - . .. :::_ al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial -,:; r domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. Two weeks ago, the Stockholm European Council confinned these orientations and even added key issues sue~ a~ ageing in the EU and the role of bfotechnology in the Eur9Pean economic growth. 12 Fax re!;U de 06/04/01 09:01 All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in ' particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been dedining significantly In most of its economies for three years . According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations . EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital m~bility and a better functioning single market; firms Yt'ill become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue_ to be put on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets . The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic perfonnance and could react ·-accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly ~ on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy , especially competition, continue to apply to each economy_ Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the_goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of 13 Pg: 14 Fax re-;u de 06/04/01 09:01 these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and ~ regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a vie~ to ensure ear1y warnings and appropriate reactions . .. . .. Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the pr~sent diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central· ~ankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary , we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is paving the way for medium and for long-term, sustainable robust growth. This is the strong belief of the Europeans. I see th·ree main channels through which price stability is fostering growth. First , preserving and reinforcing the competitiveness of the productive sector through low inflation and therefore low unit production costs. Second, reinforcing the trust of savers.-in that monetary and financial instruments will preserve their value in the medium and long run therefore permitting low medium and long term market interest rates . And, last but not least, fostering growth of domestic demand by preserving the purchasing power of households through low inflation. - This last contribution to growth is particularly important presently in the Eurozone. In reinforcing confidence of the European people in the ability of the Eurosystem to deliver price stability and low inflation we are improving the ~verall confidence of the consumers and therefore the level of consumer demand. Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are calling for · implementing 14 Pg: 15 ,, 06/04/01 09:01 resolutely anti-Malthusian policies in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from th.ese advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to aHow ~ unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which ainJ at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe ~- · from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ·new economy"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic -as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attibJde in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouragi~ ,to~erm growth. -As regards our present diagnosis on the situation of the Eurozone we are very often asked several questions, in particular : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability ? "" and What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe? "" The best I can do is certainly to refer to the consensus of the Council of Governors of the ECB as summed up by our President Wim Duisenberg . 15 pg: 16 Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 The European Central Bank confirms its position of !Await and see"" with regard to its monetary policy stance. In an environment of Increased uncertainty about the global economy and its impact on the euro area. the Governing Council is carefully assessing whether and to what extent upward risks to price stability will continue to de~line. The ECB has the primary objective of maintaining price stability. Within its forward-looking strategy, the Governing Council had raised central bank interest rates to contain increasing inflation risks and to bring inflation back to levels below 2% over the medium term. This policy has retained credibility as demonstrated by continuing low inflation expectations. It is important for economic growth that the households of • · the euro area can rely on price stability preserving their purchasing power and,  therefore, swpportirig_ solid domestic demand. Information from the first pillar shows that money growth has been on a downward trend since the spring of 2000, indicating that upwards risks to price stability from the monetary side have receded . As for the second pillar, somewhat lower real GDP growth this year will contribute to a reduction in domestic upward price pressures. On the other hand, owing to the risk of second-round effects from past oil price increases, wage developments need to be monitored carefully. Thank you for your attention. 16 Pg: 17 TOTRLT ANT.

"discours_2001_06_15.json","15.06.2001","Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France at the European Financial Markets Convention (EFMC 2001) Paris, 15 June 2001 PRESERVING FINANCIAL STABILITY IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALISED WORLD Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this European Financial Markets Convention. The impressively dense program of the Convention illustrates that the integration of financial markets in Europe is a major and multi-dimensional challenge. The Banque de France and the Eurosystem have a strong interest in all these issues. In particular, a safe and efficient functioning of the clearing and settlement systems of the euro area is crucial for the stability and efficiency of the financial system and for the good implementation- of monetary policy. The consolidation of the market infrastructure, currently underway, will contribute to reaching these objectives through the fostering of market liquidity and the reduction of transaction costs. There is however no single path for such a consolidation : it will be up to the market to select the way which best fits its needs, while it will be up to regulators and to the Eurosystem to make sure that the resulting infrastructure is adequately safe, efficient and reliable . I would like now to share with you some views from the broader perspective of financial globalisation. As you know, the globalisation of the world economy and the development of financial markets were driven by two key factors: - firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced in Europe by the setting up of the single market and subsequently of the Economic and Monetary Union- which liberalised capital flows and enhanced competition among financial sectors; - and secondly, technical and financial innovation, which simultaneously paved the way for the creation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected. What is interesting to stress regarding financial globalisation is that the interaction of free capital movements within interconnected markets, increasing integration of market segments and hedging opportunities provided by new financial instruments have allowed a better fit between the financing capacities and borrowing requirements of governments, households and companies. The use of market interest rates, which represent the markets' consensus on the risk . incurred at a moment, as a driving force is fully beneficial to an efficient allocation of capital. Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercer competition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of pure and perfect competition, which is beneficial to all consumers. Last but not least, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled • directly into investment. Reducing the share of bank financing, and consequently that of money creation, has enabled a less inflationary financing of the economy. Thus increased, monetary stability has produced tangible and positive effects and contributed decisively to a strong and sustainable growth of the world economy. However, while globalisation and financial integration have decisively contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, experience also suggests that financial asset prices have experienced in some circumstances somewhat erratic developments. The rapid emergence of the ""new economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000- followed by a series of sharp corrections- illustrated the potential of markets for providing funding to the real economy, particularly to the most innovative sectors; but it demonstrated again the tendency of markets to over-react, moving from excessive optimism to disproportionate pessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for the behaviour of firms and households. Thus financial authorities have been confronted with boom-bust episodes which must be carefully monitored, since they could,affect global monetary and financial stability. I would like therefore to consider two issues here: • First, some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder a smooth and efficient functioning of the markets, and • Second, the authorities might reflect on some ways of fostering more diverse behaviour on the markets. • 1. Some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder a smooth and efficient functioning of the markets Even though fixed interest rate markets have a tendency to be somewhat contra-cyclical, financial asset price have tended to fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals for long periods of time. 1. 1. Experience suggest that asset price cycles continue to be very substantial • In the last two decades market forces have indeed tended to cause misalignments between equilibrium and actual asset prices. Stock markets in particular have experienced this phenomenon. But in foreign exchange markets as well, prices have also a tendency to diverge substantially from their ""equilibrium level"", although those divergences have been contained through fruitful G7 co-operation during the last .15 years . • In addition, some markets have seen an increase in volatility and frequent volatility peaks. Although cyclical moves should be clearly distinguished from volatility, the latter may in some circumstances exceed what can be considered optimal, making the price determination mechanism less efficient and thus contributing to .misalignments . • Moreover, as demonstrated by a number of financial crises during the last two decades, contagion among countries and across financial markets has been frequent. As a result, investors have faced asset price fluctuations that might be more synchronised than before. • Lastly, the connections between credit, asset price and business cycles have tended to amplify cyclical swings. Credit, in particular, is playing an important role in asset price fluctuations. Observed in particular during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted. Another example is provided by boom-bust cycles in asset prices which have often been associated with sharp economic contractions. 1.2. Several factors are in play when financial asset prices experience amplified moves I shall give a few examples. • Some market participants have become more inclined to engage in ""short-termism"", that is, they nught be too preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield immediate financial results that are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market all assets and liabilities has also contributed to this widespread focus on immediate financial performances. This focus on short-term performance can translate into additional volatility in the price discovery process: the shorter the investment horizon of market participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. • Mimetic behaviour is by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. However, technological developments on markets may have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour. The spread of benchmarking, which allows fund managers and clients to measure performance against that of other funds, together with the growing competition within the sector, appears to have increased such mimetic behaviour. Some operators have come . to the conclusion that it is better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than take the risk of being right, or wrong, alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed, a few years ago; as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. • The spread of certain fund management techniques, in particular index management, which has proven very popular on equity markets, may have contributed to amplifying movements in financial asset prices. This technique endeavours to match as accurately as possible developments in stock market benchmark indices. It therefore mechanistically leads managers to accentuate current price trends by buying stocks that are on the rise and selling those that are falling. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indexes and that, as a result, the indices might end up creating rather than measuring performance. • The impact of risk management techniques on· market dynamics is · particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting. Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standards approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and set up exposure limits . Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments~ But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of homogeneous risk management techniques by financial intermediaries has had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock and the spill-over effect. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, their growing use may have produced some adverse consequences . When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All these factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 2. For this reason, the authorities might reflect on some ways - in conjunction with the financial industry - to foster behavioural diversity in global markets Monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which may be jeopardised by shocks from both the financial and the real economies. However, it must be · stressed that an adequate monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite to smooth the financial cycles. An appropriate monetary stance is crucial for banks . and monetary participants to base their decisions on solid ground. The objective of price stability lowers economic agents' uncertainty regarding future price developments. In addition, by committing itself to a long-term objective, the central bank reduces market uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest rates and money supply are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy. However important, a sound monetary policy is not enough. To safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, and in particular an efficient pricing mechanism, it is essential to protect, and even reinforce, the diversity of behaviour on the markets. This necessary diversity is merely the echo of the diff ere:rit time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore a few possible avenues for future action. 2.1- Strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency ¦ Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore continues to be a priority. ¦ One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness . A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties , all neighbouring countries, or countries that share common characteristics, are treated in the same way - regardless of their actual economic and :financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. Transparency has substantially increased since the Asian crisis, thanks to a solid global consensus. Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. 2.2- Take into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants • Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, these types of investors are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors, who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. • To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures . This objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds (including pension funds) and life insurance companies are assessed . In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use . It implies that some rules and standards would be adap~ed to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. I have no answer at this stage. I am only asking the question . 2.3- Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions • As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used by too many participants. To some degree, this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they took inadequate account of market liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis-, such tools tend to give converging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. ¦ The fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average is a guarantee that standardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. In this respect, I must stress that the Basie Committee, as illustrated by the new Capital Accord, is encouraging banks to use more sophisticated and accurate risk measurements techniques. ¦ In addition, supervisors might help -and obviously they are already helping- to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing . This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events . The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach. These are only examples of options to help improve the functioning of markets. There is probably some merit in an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations , as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices, and of structural developments of market themselves, to identify possible amendments and improvements that could help protect and enhance the behavioural and conceptual diversity of modem financial markets. In conclusion, let me stress the important role played by central banks in preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. • The recent years have shown the benefits of monetary stability in terms of growth in a globalised world. It is of course closely linked to central bank's independence, which is no longer a matter of debate. • Financial authorities are nevertheless faced with a new challenge, which is to strengthen financial stability in a context of amplified financial cycles. I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. • Central banks have a undoubtedly special responsibility due to their position at the heart of financial systems: they contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions gives them a thorough understanding of banking systems, they contribute to banking supervision, last but not least, central banks are responsible for a safe and efficient functioning of payment systems and, at least for some of them, of securities clearing and settlement systems.

I also thank Arthur Andersen and the Banco Bilbao Viscaya for their contribution to this gathering. It is also a great pleasure to meet again with my colleague Jaime Caruana, between two meetings of the ECB Governing Council. I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, Within ten months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. Then, a decisive_event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. ,. l. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. 2 Fax re9u de rg , -. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem ·has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in real -time throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system now processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1,000 billion euros daily, of which 43% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. 0 bl Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Spain towards the Banco 3 Fax re,;u de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 5 de Espana, or in the other countries participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks -of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We 0 have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3; we have recently confirmed this rate of growth of 4,5 % as an important factor for stabilising expectations. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. 0 4 Fax re~u de t'g : b The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in oLJr eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, Which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears . to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has kept intact the legacy of credibility that it has inherited. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant 0 efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference- which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website. This was the case when we met last Thursday in Frankfurt. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 151 January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that O soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other important central banks decided to go along the same path. 0 Being accountable for an independent institution In a modern democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasoning 5 Fax re9u de tJ ( I' t)~I' t:J.L .Ltl • O J. C!f • I that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so in total in ten languages), through the lens of twelve different cultures the same message from the Eurosystem. To improve its transparency and its communication even further, the Eurosystem decided to publish for the first time in December 2000 Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. In terms of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to explain, justify, 0 whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken- I think that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the (j lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy contains some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. VVhat can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very important question? 0 6 Fax re9u de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 8 Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever takes place, does not necessarily e imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuefson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. 0 0 The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 Fax re9u de 07102/01 10:01 Pg: 9 0 0 0 In this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty proyisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium tern,, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. a Fax reyu de 07/0V01 10:01 Pg: 10 0 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than withfn a long-established monetary union such as the US. 0 0 11. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro fn the medium term. What is very encouraging fn this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market al The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the sfngle market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 Fax re9U de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 11 0 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. bl Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion euros in 1999, it is 0 now catching up _on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key G achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other ,~ 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 12 0 segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro in 1999, against the equivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro--area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of 0 their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and O so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. 1~ Jo'ax reyu u""' • 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 13 0 There are still some barriers to further integrati~n of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the initial policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets, in the conviction that their implementation would contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and to developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the fi) Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. 0 All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According ta the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. ,2 Fax re'iu de 87/82/01 10:01 Pg : 14 0 EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. 0 b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be put on competitiveness. Pre--euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicate.rs affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each Q economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. 0 The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. Fax re9u de 07/ 02/01 10 :01 0 Q * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the press conference following the ECB Governing Council on 1st February, Wim DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ''within the euro area, the -maintenance of price stability over the medium term ( ... ) will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these @ advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. Pg: 15 Fax re~u de We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as 0 possible, in te1TT1s of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. -As regards our present diagnosis on the situation of the Eurozone we are very often asked three questions, namely : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability ? "" Q ""What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe? u and finally ""What about the euro on the exchange markets?"". Let me respond as concisely as possible to these three questions. To the first one I will refer to the analysis displayed, in the name of the Governing Council, by Wim Duisenberg :"" after the recent slowdown in monetary growth the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised "". As far as the second question is concerned I can also refer to a joint analysis of the G) Governing Council : "" While downside risks to real GDP growth exist, growth is very likely to continue at a reasonably robust pace."" 0 Finally, as regards exchange rates I will only mention that we are living in a universe of floating exchange system : in such a system exchange rates are not a target but are a pertinent indicator for monetary policy. And I see only one sentence to sum up our position:"" A solid , a strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". Thank you for your attention. ,.r C !J , .1.0 ","jean-claude trichet",""

I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the launch of the notes and coins, which will be a reality with in 75 days. Before touching upon the subject of this exposition, I would like to make two short comments related to the economic and financial impact of the tragic events _of 11 September in the United States. I would first like to stress the importance of coolheadedness in exceptional circumstances : coolheadedness of the public auhorities, of the institutions, of the national central banks and of the citizens. Being confronted with an exceptional event, the Eurosystem gave an exceptional response. It ensuied a calm and orderly functioning of the financial markets. In addition, on Monday, 17 September, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to lower the ECB key rates by 50 basis points . This decision was taken in concert with the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve System and was fully consistent with the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. This opportune ~nd concerted reaction of central banks, and more genera !!y, of supervisory authorities, occurred in an environment characterised by a remarkable moderation and sense of responsibility on the part of market professionals . It must be recalled that, in the end, the robustness of a system is basically dependant on the quality and dedication of the persons taking part in it. If we keep this in mind, it can be said that the resilience of the interna tional financial system is a very positive sign : it comforts our collective past efforts and constitutes an encouragement to pursue our task. I would now like to explain why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and the conditions and prospects for bui~ding on this achievement. I will then discuss the historical event o'f the introduction of banknotes and coins at the end of this year. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CRED IBLE MONETARY POLICY, AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1 The euro is based on a ciedible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) I would like to point out that , from a technical point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indispL1table success, and that the Eurosystem, made up of the ECB and the National Central Banks of the euro area, has fully achieved the objectives assigr ,ed to it in the following areas: - opernticnal efficiency, highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented , both for the execution of . interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market became integrated in 1999, right from the start of EMU, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries . .. and, finally, tr.e smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, which is an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre wor ~s in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. b) Together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high level of credibility of the single monetary policy which is based, in particular, on the independence of the European Central r .• . Bank and national central banks, and on the store of confidence inherited from the latter. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, European monetary union did not start from scratch. For no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the twelve currencies which now make up the euro - and represent almost two thirds of euro-area GDP - had proven remarkably stable , and were not realigned within the ERM. This high degree of confidence also stems from the acknowledged efficiency of the operational set-up of the Eurosystem, which is based on the principle of decentralisation stipulated in the Treaty . The Eurosystem is a team. The European monetary team now comprises the ECB and the national central banks of twelve Member States, following the Bank of Greece's entry on 1 January 2001. All the members of the Eurosystem work in close co-operation . c) The credibility of the Eurosystem lies, fundamentally, in its stabmty-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability . We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by providing a clear definition of price stability: that is to say a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) uf the euro aiea of below 2%. The aim of the single monetary policy is to ensure medium-term price stability, therefore creating a favourable monetary and financial enviro nment for economic growth. Price stability offers an anchor for wage negotiators , and is a necessary factor for competitiveness, which is in turn essential for achieving balanced and ther~fpre sustainao !~ economic 9rnwth. d) Lastly, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts in terms of transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central b~nks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the ECB Governing Council m~eting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference which starts with a precise report of the assessment of the Governing Council, and which is made available in real time on the ECB website. The Eurosystem was the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Other major cantral banks have since decided to follow us. Being accountable , for an independent institution in a modern democracy-or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle constellation of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to public opinion. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, as well as those by the ·Governors of National Central Banks to the attention of nat ional Institutions and public opinion, are of vital significance . Indeed, a crucial part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Goveming Council. In December 2000, the Eurosystem decided to release, for the first time, its euro area economic staff projections, with a view to improving transpa r·ency and communication . Thus, from the point of view of the accountability of the central bank in a democratic society - that is to say the duty to explain, justify, convince , The euro area is however a complex financial and economic zone . For this reason, we have adopted a broader-based approach, taking into account all relevant data. We have thus based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"" . In view of the monetary origins of inflation in the medium term, we have assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3, which constitute s· the first ""pillar"" of our monetary policy strategy . This pillar is based on a reference value which we set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggragate M3. This monetary indicator is regarded as being the most compatible with medium-term price stability. Last December, we confirmed this 4.5% growth rate for M3. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term . The reference value of M3 is consistent with lasting price stability. Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the economy and capital flows with the rest of the world. However, trends in monetary aggregates are not in themselves sufficient for assessing the risks to price stability . This is why we need an exhaustive description of the prevailing economic and financial situation. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is based on a broad range of var iables acting as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments . Our monstary strategy ensures a continuity from the monetary policies previously conducted by the national central banks, which now belong to the Eurosystem. This strategy has been well received by financial markets and the general public . In particular , the relatively low yields on long-term euro-denominated bonds confirm that the Eurosystem has retained the credibility store it inherited . whenever possible, and take full responsibility vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken -, the Eurosystem strives to meet the highest standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2 The euro significantly contributes to growth in Europe by enha ncing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to . convince a great number of sceptics, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro would really be launched. Many observeiS believed that the single monetary policy would never come to fruition! Facts have disproved this conclusion. However, other observers still sometimes evoke the supposed fragility of the euro area stemming from the supposed economic and structural divergences between euro area countries. How can we answer this important question? Firstly, monetai'y' union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflati on or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us take inflation for example . Present differentials are not very large, 1n comparison with those of the United States, which is a long-estab lished monetary union of comparable size. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of r ,rices naturally gives rise to different inflation rates across EMU countries . The convergence of productivit y and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence . C My intimate conviction is that we will witness further European integration and, in the medium term, an increasing correlation of economic developments in the araa. Several academic studies show that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. I know that this issue of cycle synchronicity is all the more important here in the UK, as this is one of the five economic test :; that the Government will have to assess before calling for a referendum on EMU. Secondly, the question has often been raised as to whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, to achieve this, the COirect mix is required between fiscal, economic and monetary policies . In the European Union , Member States are responsible for conducting economic and fiscal policies. We therefore believe that these policies should be closely co-ordinated . Co-ordination is stressed in the Treaty itself, which requests that Member States treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Naturally , this economic co-ordination can in no way undermine the independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem. Even more importantly, the euro area possesses institutional mechanisms which are conducive to an appropriate policy mix: the Stability and Growth Pact includes, on the part of the Member States, strict fiscal requirements. I will cite three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: . First, by keeping a rein on the fiscal policies of the EMU Member States, the Pact ensures a satisfactory policy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, in order to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and hence no significant ""federal"" budget. Mutual surveillance and close co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Eurogroup"" and of the Ecofin Council. Keeping the deficit below 3% of GDP, and achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the euro area. - Second, the Pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from hav ing to bear an unjustified risk premium on interest rates, resulting from the poor management of other EMU economies, by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. And lastly, the Stabilit)I and Growth Pact disproves the assert ion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State . Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal posit ion ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to allow budget deficits to increase during periods -of specific national difficulties without exceeding the 3% reference value . In short, it enables countries to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic conditions. This buffer can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during economic downturns . But of course, the extent to which Governments can let automatic stabilise rs play strictly depends on the initial level of the fiscal balance; obviously countries which still have fiscal deficits have less room than countries with budgets close to balance or in surplus. II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was broadly successful, one may ask, at this juncture, what the conditions are for the full and ongoing success of the euro in the medium and long term . Nhat is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that, in a number of areas, the euro in itself appears to be a catalyst for meeting thesa conditions. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market a) The euro makes the completion of the single market possible. It enables the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, and all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. However, the ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while monetary barriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange rate movement5 and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be the euro cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only companies -which has been the case since 1 January 1999 - but all our citizens to enjoy all the benefits of using the same monetary instrument throughout Europe, just like Americans do today with the dollar throughout the United States. b) Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant chau-:ge in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M&A market has been in 2000 one of the most dynamic in the world with operations totalling around one trillion euro. The single monetary policy encourages structural changes in the financial sector, in both the euro area money market and longer-term capital markets. This gives euro area investors greater possibilities and improved financing and investment conditions. - From the beginning of . January 1999, cross-border money market transactions increased sharply to almost two-thirds of total activity on all money market segments. The unsecured deposit interbank market -which is mainly concentrated on the shortest maturities-- is highly integrated. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. E:ONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have pmmpted market participants to concentrate their euro cash management activity in order to take advantage of the higher liquidity levels on the secondary market. Needless to say, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. - As regards stock markets and bond markets, major progress has been made in terms of integration. According to recent statistics, the euro, together with the dollar, appears to have been a major bond issuance currency in the first semester of 2001, with the eurn c1<rcqunting for close to 40% of total issuance. Furthermore, • • I Euri:>pean investors hav~ s~p$t~ntially diversified their bond portiolios . : . : ~ . ,: ; . since the introduction of the euro, prompted by the removal c f the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve better performances for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to current trends in mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems , clearing houses, and similar institutions. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsteidam exchanges merge to create EURONEXT? Undeniably , the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan may be implemented by 2005 . The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securit ies markets, ratified by the European Council meeting in Stockholm in March 2001: we are ci;>nvinced that the implementation of these broad guide lines will help to improve capital allocation in Europe and foster developme nts on equity markets in line with monetary policy requirements. 11.2. The euro is an incentive foi further structural reforms a) The euro , per se, is also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in a li non-financial domains in Europe: a single currency faci litates the compari son of prices , taxes and earnings. The euro could encourage ""cross fertilisat ion"" of best practices through increased co-ord ination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as the labour market , educat ion and tra ining, job creation incentives, effectiv_e welfare safety nets, etc. For this reason, the ( European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, ·explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination . The Lisbon European Council further enhanced the medium--term strategy necessary for structural reform in the Union. The following developments are a step in the rignt direction : the emphasis on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States , and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which will examine the structural issues closely. The recent European Council meetings in Stockholm in March 2001 and Gothenb urg in June 2001 confirmed these guidelines and even added a number of important issues such as the consequences of the ageing population in the European Union , the role of biotechnologies in economic growth, and the environment. All European countries must resolutely pursue the reforms they have already initiated . It must be acknowledged that much has already been done , in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high , despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for the past three years. Accord ing to the IMF, the OECD and central banks, 75% of unemployment is of a structural nature, i:e. generated by an environment which handicaps job creat ion. There is no doubt that EMU stimulates structural reforms on the labour market. With increased capital mobility and the smooth functioning of the single market , firms will become increasingly sensitive to the gE-neral environment in terms of their competitiveness when choosing a pari:icular location in the euro area. The actual process of selecting an investment location within the euro area will be a major incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b) Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be placed on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy required cijreful monitoring of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could then react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and vary reactive. At present, with the advent of the single currency, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance, as economic policy errors could have slower and more insidious repercussions, such as rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy continue to apply to all euro area countries. Jobs are created by consumers - totally free to purchase whatever they wish - when they choose the goods and services that they deem to be best value for money. Companies - totally free in their investment choices -locate . their business according to the relative competitiveness of the different possible sites. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness . even more closely than before, in particular unit production costs, and the tax and regulatory framework. The multilateral surveillance carried out in the context of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competition trends in each euro area country and in the zone as a whole and, where necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. I L Ill. A SMOOTH CHANGEOVER TO THE EURO WILL ALSO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR FOR EUROPEANS' CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CURRENCY Of course, the Eurosystem is at the heart of the euro cash changeover process. Our challenge consists in replacing all national monetary units by the euro in all monetary and financial relations of public administrations, banks, enterp rises, businesses and citizens. The first contribution of the Eurosystem is the euro banknote production . Today, more than 11 billion banknotes have been manufactured, out of a total of 14.9 billion. The launch stock is almost ready. The manufacturing process has been carefully monitored, in accordance with state of the art security standards. The new banknotes combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro. Thase security features provide all persons handling cash, especially the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes . Special attention has also been given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted . The Eurosystem also plays a key role in the supplying process of euro banknotes and in the withdrawing process of former national monetary units. At the national level, each central bank of the euro area works in close co-operation with credit institutions, security companies, shopkeepers and ~1olice forces. This fruitful concertation is essential to the success of such a huge operation, on both fields of logistics and security. ( The cashless euro is already in use The final stage of the introduction of the euro will include two changeovers: the changeover to the cashless euro, which concerns all book-entry transactions (cheques, bank accou~ts, bank card payments, transfers, loans , etc.) and the changeover to the cash euro, which concerns banknotes and coins. This summer, banks started to systematically convert bank accounts into euros and provide customers with euro cheque books. In various partici pating countries, including France, all bank accounts will have been converted by the end of October. It is now up to each citizen in the euro area to establish a new scale of values for the currency. In this respect, retailers have a fundamental role to play: their active participation will greatly facilitate the euro changeover as a whole. The cash euro will be in circulation within 75 days As regards the cash euro, the main task now consists in frontloading the banknotes and coins so that, on 1 January 2002, transactions can be carried out smoothly in the best possible security conditions . To achieve this, frontloaded coins are supplied to credit institut ions. Banknotes will be provided to them (as of 1 December in France). Retailers will also be provide d with frontloaded banknotes and coins. Furthermore, in order to familiarise the public and to facilitate the giving of change as of 1 January 2002, individuals wi ll be able to obtain, as of mid-December, packs of coins known as 'euro starte r kits' . As of 1 January 2002, banks will only issue euros, retailers will give change in euro and ATMs will supply euro banknotes . A few days after this date, almost all transactions will be carried out in euro. C Beyond technical aspects, the Eurosystem -and also public authorities- have _an important responsibility of informing the general public on the challenges ahead, the deadlines and the practical aspects of the euro cash changeover . The success of the global process depends heavily on the confidence c-f the general public and cash handlers as well. Preparing people to be well informed and to feel confident in using the euro banknotes and coins is the overall objective of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign conducted by the Eurosystem. This campaign aims to reach the general public through the mass media. It is closely supported by a Europe-wide Partnership Program _me with more thari 2 600 national and international organisations . It has now entered (. into an intensive information phase, since the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features by our President, W. Duisenberg, on 30 th of August. As Mr Duisenberg stressed, this event was more than a mere technical presentation, but took on an historical and symbolic dimension . On 1 January 2002, we will have the honour of witnessing the largest currency changeover that the world has ever experienced . This will be the crowning achievement of a long economic and political process which led to the creation of Monetary Union on 1 January 1999. This unique event in European history will help to ensure lasting prosperity, which is not only in Europe's interest but that of the rest of the world as wel I. * * * Now, speaking here, in London, I cannot help mentioning the question of the entry of Britain into the euro area. I would like to stress the following points: - first of all, we should never forget that the UK is unanimously and warmly welcome in the euro area. It depends only on the decision of the British people and of the British authorities to join in . Everybody on the continent is very warmly hoping for a positive decision by the UK. _ Secondly, I hope- that I have been sufficiently convincing, in this exposition, that the euro is the necessary last major tool for achieving the single market that has been so strongly and so unanimously supported by the UK since its setting up in 1985, 1986. - And, thirdly, let us not forget the figures. Since 1 January 2001, 12 of the 15 members of the European Union have been members of the euro area, i.e. four fifths of the member states. These 12 members represent four fifths of the population of the European Union, that is 304 million out of 378 and four fifths of the consolidated GOP of the European Union. It is already a vsry large area more populated, even without the UK, than the United Sta tes of America. The joining of the UK would considerably enhance for Britain all the economic advantages of participating fully in so vast a single market with a single currency. As regards the present situation I would like to make the following remarks: -first, the main message in the present exceptional .circumstances, is that the first quality of all Institutions, all economic leaders, all enterprises as well as households is to keep one's nerves . The best gift we could give the terrorists would be to change our plans, to cancel endeavours, to delay decisions, to reduce investment or consumption . We, Institutions, enterprises, individua ls had and have projects : let us realize them, in time, and unchanged . -second, let us beware of fashion. It was still fashionable, a year ago, to embark on vibrant eloge of the new economy, to predict the end of the business cycle and to forecast for ever very high level of productivity progress and buoyant economic growth. To-day some kind of herd behaviour drives a lot of obs ervers ancl ·•actors in . the opposite direction : overwhelming pessimism as regards the ( present situation and the economic future. Both attitudes are equally totally inappropriate. It is up to the Central Banks to remain moderate in their judgments, pragmatic and lucid in the various circumstances and to offei an anchor not only for monetary am;I financial stability but also for stability of judgment. -third, fostering confidence is a major contribution of the Eurosystem to the prosperity of the European economy. Confidence is a very precious ingredient in the present European conjuncture : confidence in the euro, in price stability, in its ability to be a highly reliable instrument for savings, in its medium and long term solidity. Confidence of the consumers in price stability underpins growth through dynamic household consumption - which is today a major motor of economic grO,vth. Confidence of the savers underp ins groVv1h through a favourable financial environment. Thank you very much for your attention. l., /I ?_ ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2002_04_23.json","23.04.2002","Keynote address by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago April23,2002 Asset Price Bubbles and their Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour and pleasure for me to talk today in Chicago at the invitation of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in front of such a distinguished audience on the theme of asset price bubbles. As a central banker, my main focus will be on the implications of asset price developments and bubbles for both monetary policy and financial stability. The far-reaching changes observed over the last decade on financial markets, the growing role of these markets for the financing of the economy, and the evidence gathered over the recent period on the key role that financial factors may play in shaping and amplifying the business cycle, have drawn attention to the relative importance of asset prices and wealth effects on the real economy. There are at least two reasons why asset prices and wealth effects may have grown over the last decade: - first, changes in asset valuations, mainly driven by the rise in the new economy stock prices from the mid-1990s and their subsequent collapse in 2000, have been dramatic. This is well documented for the United States. But, even in Europe, where the influence of the so-called ""new economy"" is more modest, the rise in stock prices has also been significant ; 1 - second, these changes have probably influenced private spending more than past asset prices movements did because of the more widespread share ownership observed in a number of industrialised countries. As far as France is concerned, market capitalisation as a percentage of GDP increased approximately fourfold between 1990 and 2000 (28% to 110.5%) and we have some evidence that the share of Households' equity holdings in financial assets has also risen. All of these developments have recently raised the issue of whether monetary policy should react to financial asset prices, and more generally to asset prices. The motivation is two-fold: not only could the large swings, misalignments or even bubbles, on asset prices endanger price stability, which is the main objective of most central banks, but also they could impinge upon financial stability, which is an other important goal of central banks. Let me now develop these two points. 1 - Implications for monetary policy ~ Transmission channels of monetary policy The role asset prices may play in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is well known theoretically , although quite difficult to characterise empirically. Monetary policy mainly controls the interbank overnight rate, which is not directly relevant for any material economic decision. The way to which monetary policy affects the real economy is when it impacts on relevant financial prices, i.e. when it moves the whole yield curve, or when it affects the exchange rate and other assets prices. 2 (I There might be there several channels through which the policy rate can affect asset prices or asset valuations: - first, changes in interest rate modify people's expectations about future economic growth, and thus their profit expectations; - second, monetary policy decisions may change the set of discount factors economic agents apply to their profit expectations or to the future stream of services or revenues from the asset they hold (housing for instance); - finally, interest rate changes may induce portfolios' shifts amongst assets that may in turn affect their relative prices. Besides this, and for the sake of simplicity, I will call it the ""interest rate channel"", changes in asset prices also generate wealth effects that may have a significant impact on several components of aggregate demand, namely consumption and investment. These wealth effects feed through to the economy via various channels, such as a direct increase in net wealth, which may lead to a rise in consumption because of households' inter-temporal smoothing behaviour; via Tobin's Q, which activates firms' investment; or via an increase in the value of collaterals, which may reduce agents external financing constraints and enhance final spending, in accordance with the ""broad credit channel"". Although the evidence is mixed about the effectiveness of the wealth channel, even in the United States 1, it is likely to have increased over recent years. Moreover, asset prices fluctuations or changes might also activate some confidence or expectations channels that may in turn influence households' or firms' spending decisions. For all of these reasons, asset prices have a particular role in the conduct of monetary policy. 3 How should central banks react? Does this mean that monetary policy should react directly to asset prices? Or, more precisely, should asset prices be directly taken into account by the central bank's reaction function? This issue is still debated amongst researchers and academics; my feeling is that we should remain extremely cautious about it, perhaps because it would be like opening Pandora's Box if we started setting our key policy rates according to asset price changes. Another reason for being extremely cautious is that assessing asset prices' valuations is a very challenging exercise. And what matters is not only the asset price level per se, or the pace of its change, but also its deviation from a highly hypothetical fundamental value, which basically is hard to measure or determine. Although, from time to time, it may seem that asset price dynamics are not really correlated to overall economic development, it is generally hard to assess whether these dynamics are rooted in some deep fundamental changes or whether asset prices evolve according to some ""pathological path"". The recent ""tech-stock bubble"" provides us with an illustration of such a difficulty: while one was witnessing ~ the ""irrational exuberance"" in 1996, the surge in capital spending associated with the development of new technologies resulted in a faster productivity growth, which in turn boosted equity prices. At that time, uncertainties about fundamentals (was there an American miracle?) made difficult a proper assessment of asset valuations, although the large movements in asset prices where a concern for central banks. 1 Cf. Martin LEITAU and Sydney LUDVIGSON (2001): ""Understanding Trend and cycle in asset values : bulls , bears and the wealth effect on consumption "", CEPR discussion paper , n° 3104, December. 4 However, when expectations reverse, for example due to the reassessment of expected profitability in the economy, and consequently asset prices decrease, the point is to determine whether the attitude of the central bank ought to be different in order to preserve monetary and financial stability. That is, some could argue that the central bank's response should be asymmetric. In the booming phase, as long as price stability is not endangered, central banks do not react to the rise in asset prices. Conversely, in the recession phase or when a bubble bursts, central banks could consider reacting if they deem that monetary and financial stability is endangered. What could then restrain them from doing it? Such an asymmetric reaction, all the more if it seems to be systematic, has actually a cost, pointed out in the literature, since it may generate some moral hazard problems: as long as economic agents believe the central bank will ultimately make use of its ""safety net"", there is an incentive to invest on riskier projects in order to magnify expected returns, keeping in mind that potential losses are likely to be limited. Would then, a systematically symmetric reaction by a central bank to asset price changes solve this problem? I would not share that view, because central banks cannot accurately assess the deviation of asset prices from their highly hypothetical fundamental value. To illustrate my point, let us consider a situation in which the central bank fails to diagnose the presence of a bubble, and therefore does not react appropriately to the surge in asset prices, then agents may become involved in riskier projects without having consciously taken the decision to accept greater risk, but on the ground of what they have interpreted as a sound financial and economic environment. As a result, we have shift to another problem, which is close to the idea of ""disaster myopia"" .2 2 J. M GUTIENTAG and R. J HERRING (1986), ""Disaster myopia in International Banking"", Essays in International Finance, 164, Princeton University. 5 The issue of measuring price stability However, this raises another issue, especially in the current context of muted inflationary pressures but ample fluctuations in asset prices: are we measuring inflation accurately? Is price stability being ensured, in the context of large movements in asset prices? Shouldn't asset prices be taken into account when defining price stability? Up to now, this debate has focused on the role asset prices may play as leading indicators of inflation: one rationale behind this thinking may be that asset valuation is computed in a forward looking manner, and ~ therefore asset prices embed expectations about future economic growth and future inflationary pressures. Empirical evidence gathered on such an issue tend to support the idea that some asset prices, housing prices in particular, may actually play such a role. However, this theory has to be qualified by the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, wealth effects are difficult to establish in a definitive manner. This is probably less true for the US, although this is debatable and could be discussed in this conference, but this is more likely to be true for the euro area. Moreover, there might be a danger that asset prices diverge from the CPI, as this was observed over the last few years. There might be an internal conflict here if the objective of ~ price stability is defined by aggregating the changes in the CPI and the changes in asset prices, and this is a crucial issue since the nature of both types of prices is fairly different. So, do asset prices have a key role to play in the conduct of monetary policy? To answer this question, I will briefly describe the way we deal with asset prices in the conduct of the European single monetary policy. As you already know, the ECB's monetary policy strategy is based on a two-pillar approach. This concept of monetary policy was designed to promote the conduct of a sound monetary policy whilst coping with the complexity of the set of major determinants of 6 I, inflation -fully recognized by the Governing Council of the ECB-. That is the reason (t why we rely upon a binocular vision of the factors of inflation, i.e. as a monetary phenomenon according to pillar 1 and as the result of short-term to medium-term developments of inflation according to pillar 2. This framework is also well suited to addressing the asset price bubble issue. In this context, the first pillar is very helpful for analysing how ample liquidity is within the euro area, that is to say how much the broad monetary aggregate (M3) deviates from its reference value, and how economic agents make use of this liquidity: credit and loan developments are carefully monitored, in line with economical and financial developments. Portfolio shifts are also an important part of the monetary analysis. Too rapid a credit expansion to the private sectors associated with large portfolios shifts towards equities and a strong rise in stock or asset prices would, under normal economic conditions, signal the risk of a bubble formation. The second pillar consists of a wide range of economic and financial indicators: stock and bond prices, housing prices, exchange rates are also analysed in depth. Obviously, their assessment is made in the context of maintaining price (.. stability over the medium term, and the ECB does not react to their signals unless price stability is endangered. To recap, if monetary policy does not react directly to asset price developments or to an asset price bubble, it has clearly to take under consideration all the consequences of these developments on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, on economic agents' confidence and expectations, since they may at some point affect price developments. Let me now turn to my second point, that is the implications of asset prices bubbles for financial stability. 7 f. 2- Implications for financial stability Over the last decade, we have experienced several financial crises and contagion episodes: just to name a few episodes, the Mexican crisis in 1994-1995, the Russian-L TCM in 1998, the 'Tech-Bubble"" that ended in 2000, or more recently the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey. However, recent research3 has shown that, if the frequency of financial crisis is not significantly different from what was observed in previous periods over the long run (1883-1998), recent episodes were certainly shorter, but perhaps more severe. Although financial globalisation has brought about improved macro-economic efficiency, via a more efficient allocation of resources and capital, liberalised capital flows, increased competition on financial markets, increased transparency (apart from the recent ENRON episode!), changes in asset prices have also become more pronounced and have experienced clear misalignments or deviations from their ""equilibrium"" levels. Moreover, credit seems to have played a greater role in asset prices fluctuations. Initially observed during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted, if not amplified. Several factors may explain these recent and abnormal patterns in asset prices. I shall give a few examples. - First, ""short-termism"": some market participants may have become more inclined to be mostly preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield good results immediately. However, these results are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market financial products may also have contributed to this widespread focus on 8 immediate financial performances. This emphasis on short-term performance may result in increased volatility in the price formation process: the shorter the investment horizon of markets participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. - Second, herding or mimetic behaviour: mimetic behaviour is of course by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. Technological developments on markets may however have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour, as participants are under increasing pressure to follow their peers through matching the performance of a benchmark. There is no doubt that the spread of benchmarking allows fund managers and clients to better assess their performance against that of other funds. But, in a context of growing competition within the sector, it may well have increased mimetic behaviour. Some market participants operators (whose own compensation is closely linked to the relative, rather than absolute, profit and losses they generate) may indeed have come to the conclusion that it would be better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than running the risk of being right alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend-following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. Moreover, more and more participants are able to access directly to financial markets, while the expertise to deal with a larger set of technical information is not evenly distributed. This may also reinforce the role of ""gurus"". 3 M . BORDO, B. EICHENGREEN, D. KLINGEBIEL and M. S. MARTINEZ- PERIA : ""Is the Crisis Problem Growing More Severe?"", CEPR, September 2000. 9 ((t, - Third, index management: as a fund management technique, it has proven very popular on equity markets and may have contributed to exacerbating movements in financial asset prices. Because their goal is to mimic the performance of indices, ""passive managers"" try constantly to match the composition of their benchmark. They thus help to amplify market trends, buying more as the market rises and liquidating more as the market drops. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indices and that, as a result, the indices end up creating rather than measuring performance. - Last but not least, the impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting. Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standard approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and to set up exposure limits. Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments. But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of sophisticated risk management techniques by financial intermediaries might have had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock, exhausting liquidity and (('4, contributing to contagion phenomena. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, we see that their growing use in the same fashion by all market participants may have produced pernicious effects. When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All those factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 10 So, what are the possible policy implications of these recent patterns or trends Q on financial markets? My opinion is that financial authorities might reflect on some ways to foster behavioral diversity in financial markets. As we have just seen before, some specific factors, such as short-termism, mimetic behaviour etc ... have tended to make ""contrarians"" less pro-active on financial markets. As a consequence, in order to safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, the diversity of participants' behaviours must be protected or even reinforced. This necessary diversity should logically reflect natural differences in time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore amongst many others three possible avenues for future action for both monetary or financial authorities and the financial industry. i First avenue: Strengthening the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Therefore, strengthening transparency continues to be the priority. In the same vein, attention should be paid to expand the skills and competencies required by the analysis of a more detailed and complex information. Transparency is useless if only a limited number of experts are able to deal with it. One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness. A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouring countries are treated in the same way - regardless of 11 their actual economic and financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. Transparency may have improved since the Asian crisis, which may explain why contagion effects are nowadays rather subdued (sees Argentina ... ). Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. Second possible avenue: Taking into accounts the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to (~ invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long-term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, these types of investors are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors, who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures. This ~ objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds and life insurance companies are assessed. In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use. It might imply that some rules and standards would be adapted to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. Third possible avenue: Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used on a standard basis and by all participants. To some degree, this is 12 perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been, ( . for very good reasons, massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they did not take market liquidity into account adequately at the time of the 1998 crisis -, such tools might tend to give converging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. Of course, the fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average is a guarantee that standardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. However, supervisors might help, and obviously are already helping to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing. This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach. 3- Conclusion Asset price developments are a serious cause of concern for central banks since they may impinge upon both price and financial stability. And I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. However, in my opinion, it is clearly not opportune to introduce asset prices into a monetary policy rule the central bank should commit to or in the central bank's reaction function. Besides the reasons I already mentioned, another issue 13 is: which asset price should we take into account? Should we limit to stock prices, or ( ~ extend the rule to housing prices, exchange rate, the cost of capital and so on? I would also not support the idea of introducing asset prices into the measurement of inflation or the definition of price stability. My first reason is that the nature of goods and services on the one hand, and assets on the other hand, is quite different, and so is the information contained in their prices. Another reason is that asset prices are highly volatile, much more volatile than other prices, especially in the current context of low inflation. Consequently, it might be difficult to implement a sound monetary policy by focusing on highly volatile indicators. Finally, it is highly questionable that one could determine scientifically what an asset price equilibrium value is. Some participants will probably address some of these issues during the conference, which are of great interest for central bankers. I also provided you with some examples of possible options monetary and financial authorities may take to help improve the functioning of the financial cycles. There is a lot of merit in embarking upon an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices, and finally of structural developments of markets "" themselves. I am convinced that this review, triggered not only by macro-financial considerations but also by dramatic micro observations, like ENRON, is likely to help identifying possible amendments and improvements that could, protect and enhance not only the integrity but also the behavioural and conceptual diversity which should make an essential characteristic of modern financial markets. I thank you for your attention. 14 ","jean-claude trichet",""
"discours_2002_06_14.json","14.06.2002","Oesterreichische Nationalbank 30th Economics Conj ere nee 2002 Speech: by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EUROSYSTEM : THE EUROPEAN MONETARY TEAM HOFBURG 14 June, 2002 -1 Ladies and gentlemen. ic is a gre,tt pleasure and an honour tO be with you coday. on che occasion of the 30th Economics Conference 2002 of che Oescerreichische Nationalbank, in front of such u distinauished audience . 0 I would like to present my views on the overall set•up of che Eurosysrem. The Maustricht Treaty clearly defines the institutional and organisational framework of the ESCB and of the Eurosysrem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the twelve National Central Banks of the euro area. I am convinced that such a set-up, which combines both centralised decisions and decentralised implementation, is able to cope successfully with current and future challenges. THE UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL SET-UP OF THE EUROSVSTEM RESULTS IN A CLOSE-KNIT MONET ARV TEAM The unique nature of the Eurosystem in the EU construction · The monetary field falls within the exclusive competence of the Commun tty In the EU construction, the Eurosystem is a unique institutional structure, of a , supranational (in a way : federal) nature. This is in contrast with some other policy areas, which are predominantly ruled by the principle of subsidiarity, whereby the Community rakes action ""only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better -2 achieved by the Community"". The first basic task of the Eurosystem is, according m the Treaty, ""to define and implement the mone tary policy of the ·~ community"", in order to achieve the primary objective assigned to the Eurosyscem: maintaining price stability. ' (( Subsidiarity with Member States does not apply to the monetary field, which is an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the Communiry. This ensures that: there are neither national nor ""regional"" monetary policies m Monetary Union; - the decisions of the ECB are binding on the entire Monetary Union; - monetary policy decisions are implemented in all Member States participating in Monetary Union according to identical procedures. Moreover, the probability of any inconsistency on exchange rate matters - a subject on which responsibility is shared with the EU Council - is ruled out by several provisions. First, while the ultimare decision to participate in an exchange rate system in relation to non-Community currencies is ro be made by the EU Council, the Treaty points our that the ECB shall be consulted ""in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability"". Such a decision can indeed have important implications for monetary policy. Second, the Luxembourg European Council in 1997 stated that the EU Council may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy ""only in exceptional circumstances"". and thar these general orientations muse always be ""consistent with the primary objective"" of maintaining price srability and respecting the independence of the Euro.system. This reinforces the credibility of the -3 cornmitml!nt to price stability and rules out the likelihood of any inconsistency between exchange rate policy and monetary policy. This unique institutional setting is enhanced by a strong independence coupled with transparency and communication The independence of the European Central Bank and Nacional Central Banks is enshrined in the Treaty . When exercising their powers and carrying om their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or cake instructions from Community instinuions, from any governmenr of a Member State or from any other body. ft Independence means institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider this comprehensive definition as an essenrial contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. -Transparency and communication: political institutions, opinion leaders of all sensitivities, enterprises, unions and public opinion at large must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy : an independent institution is in fact accountable before the public opinion. The ECB was one of the first central bank in the world to introduc~; as of l st January 1999, the concept of a regular, frequent, real-time display of the detailed diagnosis of the Central Bank. Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The independence of a central bank and its accounrability are two sides of the same coin: In chis respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the European Central Bank and by th~ Governors of National Central Banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are significant, and an important part of our colleclive duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arauments char underpin the decisions of the Governing Council. 0 4 ---The EMU set-up also provides for a permanent dialogue with the European and national authorities, as well as an operational framework for the co-ordination of economic policies At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as Narional Central Banks do with national instirutions. As the Eurosysrem operaces with a plurality of languages, it is important that its message is conveyed by all the Governors who are the natural contact point of the Eurosysrem for their respective national public opinion, national media and national parliaments. This shared responsibility enables the Eurosystem to deliver a ""single message"" as regards monetary policy and the exchange rate. Turning now to economic policy - that is to say fiscal and strucrural policies -there are sometimes questions on an alleged lack of co-ordination between Member States economic policies, in the absence of a political federation. It is not disputable that for EMU to function well, Member States, especially the major ones in terms of GDP, must be aware of ~e spill-over effects of all their national budgetary policies. The existence of spill•over effects justifies the implementation of close co-ordination between national economic policies. This is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subjects them to a multilateral surveillance procedure . Institutions and mechanisms have thus been sec to promote the required level of co-ordimuion. A coherent operational framework has been provided for the co-ordination of economic policies through close mutual surveillance (under the responsibility of rhe ""Euro Group"" and the Ecofin Council) and through the -5 implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact- Moreover, rhe Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, discussed each yeur by rhe Heads of States and Governments. help monitor and guide macroeconomic and structural developmems in the Member Scates. An original framework with centralised decisions and · decentralised implementation Centralisation of the decision within the Eurosystem The Treaty provides for a strong centralisation of the decision-making process within the Eurosystem. This contributes ro strengthen confidence in the institution and credibility in its commitment to price stability_ The Governing Council of the ECB is the supreme decision-making body of the ECB_ Ir consists of the six members of the Executive Board and the 12 governors of the NCBs of the Member Stares which have adopted the euro. According to the Treaty and the Statute of the E;SCB and the ECB, decisions relating to the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem are taken centrally by the Governing Council which adopts the guidelines and takes the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem. In particular, the Governing Council formulates the monetary policy of the euro area and esrab lishes the necessary guidelines for its implementation. The Executive Board of the ECB is primarily the co-ordinating centre at the operational level. In accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the Governing Council. it adopts implementing instructions addressed to the NCBs, which enables the Eurosystem to react and adapr to quickly changing 6 - . 7 conditions in the m d . . oney an capital markets, t() address specific cases and co deal with mutters of urgency. To sum up, with its c.:~nrral co-ordinaring position, the Executive Board, and thus the ECB, is che ""coach"" of the whole Eurosysrem team. The ECB and NCBs co-operate tightly in che decision-making process through the ESCB Committees. Those ESCB Committees are composed of representatives of the Eurosystem central banks and, where appropriate, of other competent bodies, such as national supervisory authorities in the case of the Banking Supervision Committee. Ac the request of both the Governing Council and the Executive Board, they provide expertise in their fields of competence and thus facilitate the preparation of the Governing Council decisions. This whole set-up contribm:es ro credibility and efficiency. In particular, the ultimate authority attributed to the decision-making bodies of the ECB contributes to the existence of a strong ''centre"" and thus to the credibility of the single monetary policy . Decentralisation of the implementation of t_he decisions: decentralisation is both possible and apptopriate In accordance with European tradition, the Eurosystem adheres to the principle of decentralisation, which stipulates that, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, the ECB shall have recourse to the NCBs to carry out operations which form part of the casks of the Eurosyscem. This principle is the organisational reflection, within the Eurosysrem, of the subsidiarity principle which underpins the whole European construction. Given due account of the knowledge and operational experience accumulated by the staff ot"" NCBs in rhe set-up of the Eurosystem, the System actually relies on -7 th~ NCBs fo h · l · r t e imp ememation of moncmry policy, the management of foreign reserves. the collection of sratistic8, the issuance of banknotes, the management of large value payment systems... As integral pans of the Eurosystem, NCBs comply with the internal legal instrumencs adopted by the Governing Council or the Executive Board. They act therefore as operative arms of the Eurosystem, carrying out on a decentralised basis the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the mles established centrally by the Governing Council. The experience accumulated since 1999 has proven that this framework is not only possible, as testified by the current practice, but is also appropriate. - Each National Central Bank remains the natural contact and interlocutor for credit institutions established in its country . They are the access points to central money in euros for national credit institutions, which have their accounts on the books of the NCBs This configuration ensures a level playing field for the different financial markers; . Through the NCBs, the Eurosystem benefits from a direct access to relevant national information. NCBs can also channel the local needs to the European level and they are of course an important channel for communication of the Eurosystem stance to the credit institutions 000 -8 THE COHESIVE ACTION OF EACH COMPONENT OF THE EUROSYSTEM TEAM HAS PRODUCED EFFECTIVE RESULTS AND CONCRETE BENEFITS The mutualised assets of the Eurosystem monetary team Common view and culture within the Governing Council The Governing Council takes the most imponam and strategically significant decisions for the Eurosystem. [ts composition represents a very fruicful ground for· building a common Eurosystem identity and culture. As a matter of fact, it perperuaces a well established tradition of close relationships and co-operation, within che European Monetary Institute (EMI), and even before within the Committee of Governors of the EEC, which was created in 1964 and greatly contributed to building the indispensable common approaches in the run up to Monetary Union. For all decisions relating to the definition and conduct of the single monetary policy, the Governing Council members vote according to the ""one member, one vote"" principle. NCBs' Governors sit in a person.al capacity, that is to say, they C- do not represent particular national interests; they take together che decisions best suited to the overall situation in Monetary Union. The smooth functioning of che Governing Council, inrer alia through its bimonthly meetings, . helped make the multi-cultural dimension of the Eurosystem a strength. In this decision-making body, common views are forged nae only on monetary policy, but also on many other issues of relevance for a cencrul bank or linked to the additional tasks laid down by the Treaty. These 9 9 -common views esrnbl ished within the Council through frequent meetings, ultimately prove very useful for the credibility of the Eurosystem . Close co-operation and team spirit between NCBs and the ECB The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co~operadon, and the team spirit is very strong. The organisation of the European monetary team according IO the principle of decentralisation allows che system to take full advantage of the diversity of its components, by making use of existing knowledge and resources with a view to share competencies and experience and enhance the Eurosystem's identity and corporate culture . The network of the ESCB Committees , which provide assistance to the decision -making bodies of the ECB, plays an imporranc role in forging the co-operation spirit between the central banks of the Eurosysrem. This original institutional feature has greatly contribured ro the progressive constitution of a shared corporate culture. As an example, within the International Relations Committee, issues scheduled for discussion by relevant international and European institutions or fora (L.IIF, 07, G 10, G20, FSF, EFC -, ... ) are prepared with all Eurosystem participants . This allows the full body of the Eurosystem to build its posmons on a comprehensive analysis and ro show a great cohesiveness in international organisations and fora . 10 j The concrete benefits resulting from this original set-up success in terms of credibility and efficiency The Eurosystem has inherited a legacy of credibility and ex.penise from its constitutive NCBs. The introduction of euro banknotes and coins on l January 2002 has been the last step of a now more-than-cwenty-year process of monetary integration. This unique and highly symbolic event for Europe can be considered as an outstanding achievement. The way the cash changeover has been successfully handled, thanks in particular m the efficiency of the monetary team of Europe, had, for sure. a strong positive impact on the image of the Eurosystem as a whole . As regard France, the early changeover of non-cash payments in 2001 , and the rapid introduction of banknotes and coins in euro in early 2002, proved to be a success entirely in line with the scenarios devised by Banque de France in close consultation with all the involved parties (the banking sector , cash-in-transit companies, the Police and the Army, retailers, col!:lpanies and consumers) . It has been the same all over Europe . Toe internationalisation of the euro also illustrates the success of the European monetary team in cenns of credibility. The euro has become a major currency in the world. As an official reserve currency , it is the second most widely used . As a bond issuance currency , according to the most recent statistics from the BIS , the euro has played a substantial role since the end of 1998 and accounted for around 35% of total "" C issuance in 200 l . The share of the euro in international bank assets has also increas~d significancly over the past two years. Furthermore, the euro constitutes a major reference currency for exchange rate regimes adopted by third countries. Over 50 countries in the world, mainly in Europe and Africa, are managing exchange rate arrangements that include a reference to the euro . The intensive trade and financial links with the euro area are the main factors behind this choice. Of course, the adoption of a euro-based exchange rate arrangement by a non EU country is a unilateral decision, and does not involve any commitment from the Eurosystem. The internationalisation of the euro might develop further, thanks to an established track record of the Eurosyscem wirh reference to its primary objective of price scability and continuing integration of financial markets in the euro area. Bur the Eurosystem does not pursue the internationalisation of the euro as an independent policy goal: this implies thar it neither fosters nor hinders this process . A successful technical framework, as highlighted by the smooth functioning of the monetary policy framework and the operational efficiency Prior to the launch of euro banknotes and coins in 2002, the launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has also been an indisputable success from a technical point of view. In this respect, three points are worth mentioning: • rhe monetary policy framework contains a wide set of instruments chosen with a view co ob~erving the principles of market orientation . equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency. The decentralisation of the operations has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth funcrioning of the 12 12 framework. Maintaining u close contact between commercial banks and their national cencral bunks has helped the financi .. tl markets to quickly adopt the harmonised practices relating w open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems. - operational efficiency is highlighted by rhe precise adjusrment of banking liquidity and effective steering of shorHerm interest rates. The Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days after the tragic evems of 11th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly functioning of the European financial markets. - security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large . value payments. It is reinforced by the decentralised ser•up. In particular, thanks to the sening up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughour che euro area and in other EU countries, the inter-bank _ market became highly integrated. The credibility of the European monetary team and of the single monetary policy, the successful changeover to the euro are major achievements. They certainly demonstrated the efficient funcrioning of EMU and of the European economic and financial institutional framework. Those are strong assets, which will help us to deal with cwo main challenges: financial stability and the accession to the EU of new Member States. 13 13 THE FLEXIBILITY OF ITS SET-UP ALLOWS THE EUROPEAN MONETARY TEAM TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES Financial stability A growing challenge _ _, _ 14 Like every modern and independent central bank, the European monetary team has to fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensuring price stability , a key condition for sustained growth, and secondly, preserving financial stability, a growing challenge in a context of globalisation of the world economy, of amplification of financial cycles, of instant access to information_ I insist on the highly complementary nature of these two objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built Maintaining financial stability might be consid~red as a fairly complex task nowadays. Indeed, globalisation and financial integration have significantly contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, by allowing a more optimal allocation of resources_ However, experience over the last decade suggests that they also have tended !O amplify financial cycles relative to business cycles, which may in some circumstances have led to somewhat erratic developments. I would also I ike to mention the rapid emergence of the anew economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000, which was followed by a series of sharp corrections - As a. result, financial authorities, and, among them, cencral banks, have been confronted with boom-bust episodes, which must be carefully monitored, since rhey could affect global monetary and financial stability. 14 ft • .. r The tra0 ic events of 11 s b . . . .::, eptem er and their 1mpnct on che financtal markets hn.ve recently reinforced concerns over financial stability. The fight against the potencial abuse of the financial system for the financing of terrorism has received top priority on international and European agendas. The international community is stepping up its efforts to hunt down money used by organised crime and terrorism. To this end, all players on che financial markets should observe the rules of international legal co-operation. The ade~uacy of the European monetary team's set~up enables it to adapt quickly to current financial trends and to contribute to tackling related challenges I would like co stress here the special responsibilities of central banks as regards financial stability, due to their position at the heart of financial systems: • they contribute directly rn supplying liquidity to the economy, via the banking sector, and might be called upon to play their role of lender of last resort in exceptional circumstances; - because of their close and constant contact with credit institutions, their expertise in banking systems is indisputable: - they contribute to prudential supervision and to the safe and efficient functioning of payment systems, and at least for some of them, to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. The present set-up of the European monetary team is appropriate to tackle the chan o-es tri o-oered by the current financial trends and the introduction of the 0 ~0 15 L euro. Tht!ir key position allows central bank~ to capitalise on the information-reluted synergies between supervisory tasks and core central banking functions. ~ Coupled wich excensive supervisory responsibilities of NCBs in domestic markets, and with reinforced co-operation ac an area.wide level, cheir traditional focus on systemic risk puts them in a strong position co assess the potenrial impact of disrurbances in domestic or international financial markets . . Beyond financial stability, the accession of new Member States to the European Union and to EMU is the last challenge that { would like to mention, but certainly not the least. Accession of new Member States to the EU and EMU Attractiveness of the European framework [ndeed, we are already working in the perspective of enlargement of the European Union and, at a later stage, of the euro area. Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating their accession to the EU. According to the very demanding calendar endorsed by rhe European Council, new accessions to the EU will take place as from l sc of January 2004, that is to say in less than L9 months. This testifies again to the attractiveness of the European Union framework, which has provided us with economic prosperity and political stability for half a century. When we negotiated the Maastricht Treaty, we did not think ar all about enlargement. History has gone very fast. And after 27 members, we may go up further, up to 36 Members or even more. ' .. The accession countries have accomplished remarkable progress in stabilizing and strengthening their economies and insiinuions. Observing their recent 16 ((' hiSt0 ry shows the major improvements those countries have made, in hardly l 0 years, on the road towards convergence with the EU and the euro area. However, we must not forget that the nominal convergence, which is requested in order to adopt the euro, must be sustainable and therefore constirutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-term priority. Indeed, the EU Treaty calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of susrainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic, in the t(_~. interest of both accessing coumries and the euro area. Moreover, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over che past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging restructurations and foreign ownership. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks chat support the banking sector, and an efficient fight against money laundering, are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countr_:ies. Role of the Eurosystem monetary team The Eurosysrem, and notably the Banque de France, is following the enlargement process with a great deal of attention. The European monetary ream monitors che enlargement process, and particularly the following points, which are of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and for accession countries themselves: . Central bank independence is of the essence. As I said earlier, it is an integral pan of the acquis communauraire, which is laid down, not only in 17 nationnl legislation, but ubove o.11 in che Maastricht Treaty. The effective implementation of the act1uis communnucaire is noc only a legal prerequisite for accession to the EU. Jr also implies che effective transformation of accession countries' economic framework, which should facilitate their integration into the EU and, later, the euro area. In this context, ic should be ensured that there is no discrepancy between the central banks' formal status in the legislation and the implemem::uion of that legislation. Independence means insticurional, operational and financial independence. We consider that comprehensive concept as an essential contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. It is of utmost imponance that all present and furore Member States respect this economic and institutional ground rule of the European framework. - I noted that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed, as it facilitates nominal and structural convergence. However, it should be clear that ERM II membership needs neither to happen immediately after EU accession in all cases, nor to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum for ado~tion of tqe euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II would allow countries co retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for increasing convergence with the euro area, for tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road cowards the adoption of the euro, for contributing to macroeconomic and ex.change rate srnbilicy, and for helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixacion of parities; and this, again, in the best interest of candidare countries themselves. 18 r In conclusion, let me make two remarks: • Firsc, the Eurosystem · s track record so for illustrates that the centralised decision~making of the Eurosystem has provided a strong and coherent basis for the exercise of the missions imparted co the European monetary team by the Treaty, both in normal and in exceptional circumsrnnces. Equally, the principle of decentralisation of operations, which is the second principle guiding the ( functioning of the Eurosystem, has also proved efficient. Both principles call for working out, developing and permanently improving a single team spirit, a single corporate culture within the ECB and the NCB 's throughout the full body of rhe Eurosystem. - Second, the currency changeover has proved that the European citizens have confidence in i:he euro, confidence in its capacii:y to be a good store of value, confidence in its medium and long-term solidity, and confidence in the capacity of the European Central Bank and the Eurosyst~m as a whole to deliver price stability. This confidence is a very precious asset:. It is a very important ingredient for fostering growth through consumer confidence and therefore consumer demand which is presently the main driving force behind the European economy.

"discours_2002_08_06.json","06.08.2002","Munich Economic Summit Statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France 3j THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND THE EU ENLARGEMENT Munich 8 June 2002 ' ( Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour to be with you today, on the occasion of the Munich Economic Summit in front of such a ' distinguished audience . I would like to present briefly my views on the important and historical challenge of enlargement that the European Union and, at a later stage, the euro area, will have to cope with. Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating accession to the EU. According to the calendar endorsed by the European Council, new accessions will take place as from 1st of January 2004, that is to say in less than 19 months. This testifies again to the attractiveness o_f the European Union framework, which has provided us with economic prosperity and political stability for half a century. The accession countries have accomplished re.markable progress in stabilizing and strengthening their economies and institutions. Observing the accession countries, recent history shows the major improvements those countries have made, in hardly 10 years, on the road towards convergence with the EU. Let's keep in mind, with some humility, the sometimes rather slow pace the current Member States took, regarding for example, trade openness, price liberalisation, or macro economic discipline. Nevertheless, there is also general agreement on the fact that the gap, in terms of average GDP per capita, between the accession countries and the euro area, although diminishing, remains still quite significant. On average, GDP per capita, in terms of purchasing power parity, might be around 44% 2 t --of that of the euro area, while in terms of current exchange rates it is only around 22%. There are large differences between accession countries, since a few of them are not that far from the EU standards. But, more generally speaking, the size of the gap, combined recently with a rather limited growth differential between the two groups of countries, suggests that the process of real convergence will be very gradual and will have to continue much beyond the tentative dates for EU accession. Although differences in income levels are not incompatible with EU and even EMU membership, it is important for accession countries to increase real convergence. Indeed, real convergence is essential to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States, thereby helping to minimize the risk and the effects of asymmetric shocks, in the best interest of accession countries themselves. The Eurosystem and, in particular, Banque de France, follows with a great deal of attention the enlargement process. Within the framework of the Eurosystem, Banque de France contributes to the process through co operation and twinning agreements with some central banks in accession countries, notably with the Bank of Poland, whose President is my colleague Leszek BALCEROWICZ, present here today, and Bank of Romania in particular. * * * 3 Let me stress a few points of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and 1 ( for accession countries themselves, on the road towards achieving catching-up and convergence with the EU. ( , ( , - Firstly, we should never forget that nominal convergence must be sustainable and therefore constitutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-tenn priority. The strict compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be key for joining the euro area, but should not be seen only as an immediate requirement for joining the EU. Indeed, the EU Treaty calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of sustainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. The sustainability of nominal convergence itself presumes that sufficient preliminary progress has been made towards real and structural convergence ( and namely having set a fully-fledged market economy, catching-up in income and productivity levels, as well as economic and social infrastructures, upgrading of the legal system ... ). Conversely, a sustainable catching-up process requires macroeconomic stability. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic. - Secondly, I noted that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed, although it should be clear that ERM II membership needs neither to happen immediately after EU accession in all cases, nor to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum for adoption of the euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II would 4 allow countries to retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for increasing convergence with the euro area, for tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro, for contributing to macroeconomic and exchange rate stability, and for helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixation of parities ; and this, again, in the best interest of candidate countries themselves. - Thirdly, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over the past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging foreign ownership. The latter has also contributed to greater integration into the EU financial system. The intermediation role of the banking sector remains fundamental for the efficient use of capital and sustained growth. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks that support the banking sector, and an efficient fight against money laundering, are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries . - Fourth, central bank independence is of the essence. It is an integral part of the acquis communautaire, which is laid down not only in national legislation but above all in the Maastricht Treaty. The effective implementation of the acquis communautaire is not only a legal prerequisite for accession to the EU. It also implies the effective transformation of accession countries' economic framework, which should facilitate their integration into the EU and, later, the euro area. In this context , it should be ensured that there is no discrepancy between 5 (, the central banks' formal status in the legislation and the implementation of that legislation. The independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty. When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. Independence means institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider that comprehensive concept as an essential contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. It is of utmost importance that all present and future Member States respect this economic and institutional ground rule of the European framework. - Fifth, and it will be my last point, let us not forget the present and future contribution of Central and Eastern European countries to the economic prosperity of Europe at large. It seems that this contribution might be sometimes underestimated . In fact, transition economies, as a whole, are as important as the US in terms of external demand addressed to the euro area: they both enjoy the same share, i.e. 13% of our exports. And, during the last two years, transition economies contributed up to two thirds (namely 2.2% over a total of3.3%) to the overall growth of our total external demand. Central and Eatem Europe countries might represent today only a small fraction of the overall consolidated GDP of Europe. But they represent a major source of potential growth and therefore, in a medium to long term perspective, a very important engine for growth to the benefit not 6 only of their own economies but to the benefit of the European economy as a whole.

"discours_2003_02_25.json","25.02.2003","FINANCIAL FORUM 2003 The Wall Street Journal Europe The New Economy Forum Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND THE EURO Madrid 25 February 2003 -1 Ladi;;;dgentlemen, it is a great pleasure and. an honour to be with you today, on the occasion of the ""Financial Forum 2003"", organised by the New Economy Forum and the Wall Street Journal Europe. I would like to present my views on the successful set-up of the euro, on the economic and financial integration of Europe and on the challenges that the euro-zone will confront going forward. THE EURO: BUil T ON A SUCCESSFUL SET UP Set-up of the Eurosystem The single monetary policy is formulated and implemented within a sound institutional framework, the Eurosystem, comprising the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area. Three principles underpin the Eurosystem : independence, transparency and decentralisation. The independence of both the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty. When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. Independence refers to institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider that independance as defined above contributes to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. Transparency and accountability: elected authorities, key economic players, as well as all European citizens must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy. At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as do national central banks with national institutions. The ECB is the only central bank in the world to enforce the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The independence of a central bank and its democratic accountability are two sides of the same coin. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the European Central Bank and by the Governors of national central banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are crucial. An important part of our collective duty consists of tirelessly explaining the rationale that underpins the Governing Council's decisions. Lastly, decentralisation: as the subsidiarity principle underlies the whole European construction, decentralisation is a major principle of the architecture of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co-operation, and the team spirit is really strong and fruitful. Monetary policy decisions are taken, at the centre, by the Governing Council, and are implemented by the national central banks in a closely co-ordinated way. 2 -ECB governance On 3 February 2003, the Governing Council of the ECB unanimously approved a Recommendation for a European Council decision, which is aimed at adjusting the voting modalities in the Governing Council in an enlarged euro area, in accordance with article 10.6 of the Statutes introduced by the Treaty of Nice. This adjustment became necessary so as to maintain the efficiency and timeliness of the Governing Council's decision-making process. The Recommendation has been submitted to the EU Council. We hope that it will eventually be endorsed by the Heads of State and Government after both the European Parliament and the European Commission, which has already delivered its opinion, have been consulted. As soon as the number of members of the Governing Council will reach 22, the total number of voting rights will be limited to 21. The six executive board members will have a permanent voting right and the NCB Governors will share the remaining 15 voting rights which will rotate among them according to pre-established rules. To ensure that all decisions taken by the Governing Council are representative of the euro area economy as a whole, Governors will be allocated to groups which differ with respect to the frequency with which their members will have voting rights. The allocation of Governors to groups will therefore be done in accordance with a ranking of their respective NCB's, reflecting mainly the size of economies and of financial sectors. All in all, this recent recommandation from the Governing Council is testimony to its ability to smoothly adapt its internal governance to the challenges posed by enlargement. Strategy of the single monetary policy The Maastricht Treaty clearly defines the ultimate objective of the single monetary policy, that is to say maintaining price stability. However, for attaining this goal, it is essential to clearly define price stability: we define it as a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (lllCP) of below 2% in the whole euro area. Bearing in mind this objective, our monetary policy strategy is based on two ""pillars"". We have first assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3. This ""pillar"" is based on a reference value which is set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. The concept of a reference value does not mean that the Eurosystem is committed to automatically correcting deviations in monetary growth in the short term. Naturally, we also follow the components and counterparts of M3 closely. In this regard, the development of loans to the private sector, as well as the evolution of government finance and capital flows with the rest of the world, deserve a particular attention. 3 -· --·--- ----- - -----However, it is common sense to say that monetary developments do not account for all the risks to price stability. This is why we have defined a second ""pillar"" for our monetary policy strategy, consisting of a broad range of variables that are referred to as indicators for the euro area price outlook. The relatively low yields on long-tenn euro-denominated bonds confinn investors' confidence in the new currency. This was not the case four or five years ago. At that time, financial markets were convinced that the euro would be the weighted arithmetic mean of its legacy currencies and would not inherit the level of confidence and credibility of the strongest of these. The euro has actually been founded on a benchmarking principle, not on a convergence towards an average. This may explain why the interest rates of the euro were the lowest in Europe from the outset. To sum up, we consider the maintenance of price stability over the medium tenn to be the Eurosystem's greatest contribution to fostering an environment which is conducive to sustainable growth and employment. And, it is also its greatest contribution to limiting unnecessary volatility of output and employment in the short run. The success, thus far, of our strategy does not mean that our current monetary policy strategy is engraved in the marble. With the benefit of hindsight, 2003 seems the appropriate point in time to take stock of our experience thus far and to reflect on the various elements of the strategy. This issue is actively dealt with our Eurosystem's staff and we plan to complete this evaluation in the course of the spring and to publish it. Needless to say that the decision to undertake an in-depth assessment of our experience does not necessarily imply that substantial changes are contemplated. Successful technical framework The launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success from a technical point of view. This is a great achievement since many observers doubted of the immediate success of a technical challenge of such a magnitude. Three orientations still shape this success: the monetary policy framework includes a set of instruments chosen with a view to observing the principles of market orientation, equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency. The decentralisation of operations has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth functioning of the framework. Maintaining a close contact between commercial banks and their national central banks has helped financial markets to quickly adopt the hannonised practices relating to open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems. operational efficiency is highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-tenn interest rates ; the Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days 4 after the tragic events of 11 th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly fun t· · f h E fin · c 1onmg o t e uropean ancial markets. Here again, doubts had been previously raised on the ability of the Governing Council to make decisions swiftly. security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of inter-bank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market has become highly integrated thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. Let me tum now to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, which has been the last step of a now more-than-twenty-year process of monetary integration. Euro changeover On 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins were issued and became legal tender in the countries of the euro area. This was a unique and highly symbolic milestone for Europe. Let me first stress that, thanks to national efforts and the co-ordination by the European Commission and the Eurosystem, almost 100 % of cash transactions in the euro area were being carried out in euro only two months after the changeover. Although the practical changeover to the euro might be considered as an outstanding achievement, we should remain vigilant on the following issues: First, price stability. Although some increases in prices of a certain number of consumer goods and services have been reported, the first evidence shows that, overall, the effect of the changeover on price stability has been marginal. But consumers must keep alert, while c?mp'.1°i~s _an? re~ailers remain responsible as regards price setting. In the end, competition should also contribute to lowering the prices in the short-to-medium term. Second, we must closely monitor the risks of counterfeiting of notes and coins : the information campaign of the Eurosystem ""The Euro. Our money"" was aimed at familiarising all the European citizens with their new banknotes and coins (and their security features) and, by doing so, it helped them identify the obviously fake banknotes. All institutions concerned, both national and European, are co-operating closely to prevent and fight counterfeiting. Right now, counterfeit banknotes are scarce and conspicuous. The credibility of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy, and the successful changeover to the euro represent major achievements. They certainly contribute to the efficient functioning of EMU and to European economic and fmancial integration, as I will explain it right now. 5 ••• EMU : A BALANCED CONCEPT FOSTERING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION EMU is an economically sound and well-grounded concept. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics that the euro would really be launched. The opinion that the single currency would never exist has of course been disproved by the facts . Nevertheless, objections are still being raised from time to time, on the alleged grounds that the euro area economy comprehends inconsistencies that could endanger and challenge the viability of EMU, all the more so since the European Union is about to welcome new members. Some observers thus claim that the lack of co-ordination between European economic policies, in the absence of a political federation, is likely to deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix. Others blame the lack of instruments allowing us to tackle asymmetric shocks that may arise, and underline the lack of flexibility or the absence of mobility of the European labour force. Others claim that the presumed economic divergences and structural gaps among euro area countries are too large to ensure a viable monetary union. How do we respond to these important objections? 1) It is not disputable that for EMU to function well, Member States, especially the major ones in terms of GDP, must be aware of the spill-over effects that national economic policies may trigger. The existence of spill-over justifies the implementation of a close co-ordination between national economic policies. This is embodied in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to consider national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Practically, member States have designed institutions and mechanisms to promote appropriate co-ordination. We can now say that EMU has in tum been beneficial to the European economic and financial integration as a whole. Indeed, a coherent operational framework has been provided for the co-ordination of economic policies through close mutual surveillance (under the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and the Ecofin Council) and through the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, discussed each year by the Heads of States and Governments, help monitor macroeconomic and structural developments in the Member States. I would like to briefly recall why the Stability and Growth Pact plays such an important role : - By supervising the fiscal policies of the euro area Member States, the Pact together with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines contributes to ensuring an appropriate policy mix within the euro area. It is 6 essential for conducting a meaningful monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget. - By setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits, the Pact also helps prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium which would be transferred from poorly managed economies to them through the channel of the single currency. As regards the second common criticism against EMU, that is to say the lack of instruments to respond to asymmetric shocks, I would like to stress that the Stability and Growth Pact helps countering this argument. Indeed, by urging countries to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase, if need be, providing that they do not exceed the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods, that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. The last set of criticisms focuses on presumed economic divergences between economies within the euro area. To answer this last objection, I would like to put forward a few ideas: Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. For example, inflation divergences across countries or regions may be accommodated in a monetary union as part of the process of convergence of productivity and living standards. Secondly, I would like to quote Professor Robert Mundell, who made, at the beginning of 1998, an interesting clarification of the Optimal Currency Area theory, and argued that in the event of a shift in demand from one meinber country to another, creating unemployment in the--firsf and· inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not necessarily be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state, province or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". Even though the EMU relates to a single monetary policy, it also relates to the harmonisation of other markets, i.e. goods and services, as well as financial markets. In these areas, the integration process is well on track. EMU fosters economic and financial integration Financial Europe under construction: the reorganisation of capital markets In 1999, as soon as the euro was launched, one of the expected advantages was the prospect of deeper, larger and more integrated capital markets contributing to reducing the cost of capital for businesses and 7 giving Europeans a greater range of saving options. These expectations have become reality in both the money market and longer-term capital markets. On the euro money market, the unsecured deposit inter-bank market is highly integrated. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. On the euro bond market, the integration process has registered three main developments: - a rapid internationalisation: The introduction of the single currency has fostered the euro-denominated private bond market, by enlarging the potential pool of investors, notably international investors. - increased competition between issuers, which has encouraged the standardisation of sovereign bonds, the gradual convergence towards ""best practices"", the development of a range of attractive and actively traded benchmark issues (especially for sovereign bonds). Besides, competition has also enhanced liquidity as issuers have increased the average size of outstanding bonds. - the modernisation of market structures: besides the rapid development of electronic trading, the consolidation of Central Securities Depositories is also paving the way for a more efficient functioning of Delivery-versus-Payment procedures, and easier and safer channels of settlement of cross-border securities transactions. This last point is of particular relevance for the Eurosystem, as the smooth functioning of European securities settlement infrastructure is key for the practical implementation of monetary policy. On the equity market, the elimination of the currency risk within the euro area has led investors to shift from a domestic orientation to a more international, sectoral one. The creation of a wide range of pan-European sectoral indices was, thus, a direct consequence of these changes in investor strategies. Additionally, the introduction of euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the financial sector. For instance, in this respect, we can stress current trends in mergers or close co-operation between banks, stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable for the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris security exchanges to jointly create EURONEXT? The large European goods and services market. Such changes in the European financial landscape have significantly improved the efficiency of capital allocation. The euro contributes to enabling European savers to easily select the most efficient investments. It also helps the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. 8 Moreover, the pace of internationalisation of the euro area economy has been further spurred by the euro. Allow me to give just one example: the level of accumulated foreign direct investment abroad by French residents since 1999 amounted to EUR 380 billion (i.e. four times its pre-1999 level). Indeed, capital flows between the Euro area and the rest of the world mirror a high degree of attractiveness: over the years 1999-2001, the Euro area has registered total inward direct investments worth 719.8 billion Euros. At this point, one may wonder which conditions are required to ensure the success of the euro and EMU in the medium term. I believe that we have to tackle three main challenges: structural reforms, financial stability and the accession to the EU of new Member States . CHALLENGES AHEAD Structural reforms ••• The fust challenge is, beyond dispute, to implement structural reforms in the euro area's economies. Structural reforms were crystallised at the European level in what is called the Lisbon strategy. The first objective of this strategy is to substantially raise our potential output growth. The second is to make our economies more competitive. Implementing the reforms: the Lisbon strategy The European Council meeting held in Luxembourg in December 1997 explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected to achieve enhanced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council, held in March 2000, further enhanced the medium-term strategy to introduce structural reforms in the Union. This strategy aims to make the European Union the world's most dynamic knowledge economy by 2010. It has since been amended so as to include social issues (at the Council of Nice in late 2000) and environmental issues (at the Council of Gothenburg in mid 2001). What has been achieved to date in the field of structural reforms is quite encouraging. Noticeable successes have already been registered with regard to policies, such as new rules in telecommunications ' electricity and gas markets. The current 2002 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines evaluation exercise is an opportunity to check on the progress accomplished in reforms that were agreed in Lisbon and recently reasserted in Barcelona. Before reviewing the priority areas where fresh impetus is required, I wish to briefly make two remarks: 9 First, the responsibility for structural reforms in the European Union rests with the individual Member States. Consequently, there is a wide variety of institutional solutions and regulatory arrangements across countries and sectors. I nevertheless consider that such a decentralised approach should be considered as an opportunity, rather than a disadvantage. It encourages ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States' structural policies. My second remark relates to the changeover to the euro. This event has been a major structural reform in itself, i.e. a powerful drive towards restructuring the European economy. An important objective consists in raising the potential output growth of the European economy If France and Europe seek to secure sustainable growth at levels that are as high as possible, the key variable is potential output growth. There are three ways of raising the level of potential output growth: First, to boost investment: the more we invest and the lower inflationary pressures, the stronger potential output growth. For example, a two-point . increase in the productive investment ratio (productive investment/ GDP, 11,4 % during the last five years in France) over the next decade would bring about an average acceleration of more than 0,5 point in potential output growth over the same period. The second way of raising potential output growth is to increase the quantity of actual labour : The European Council of Lisbon set as a central objective the rise of the employment rate of our populations from 60 to 70 % in 10 years. The Council also fixed two sub objectives : to raise the employment rate of women to 60 % and employment rate of older workers (from 55 to 64 years old) to 50 %. As a comparison, the same overall employment rate stands at 75 % in the USA. Although some progress has been achieved in this area, the lack of substantive change and the tendency in some member states to continue to use early retirement schemes remain causes for concern. The third way of raising potential output growth is to promote ways to boost gains in labour productivity: This can be achieved by increasing competition, encouraging enterprise and innovation, and improving the workforce 's skills. Indeed, on the basis of hours worked, productivity in the EU reached in 2001 83% of the level of that in the US, which points some room for improvement. That strategy should be pursued whilst increasing the overall competitiveness of our economies The Euro area displays sound macroeconomic fundamentals and satisfying price competitiveness. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals make the Euro area an attractive place to invest in : no major 10 imbalances may be observed contrary to other major areas. Indeed, the Euro area provides for a low and stable inflation environment, roughly balanced external accounts, abundant private savings, and sound financial systems. Then, in terms of real effective exchange rate, the Euro area has constantly gained in competitiveness over the past few years. In the 3rd quarter of 2002, even though the Euro real exchange rate deflated by unit labour costs in total economy versus the rest of industrialised countries appreciated by 5.4% year-on-year, it is still below its long term average (1987-2001) by 12.3%, according to the European Commission calculations. If I refer more specifically to what has been observed in the past in France, an economic strategy, based on a moderate increase in unit costs of production, gave us an important edge : the considerable improvement in the cost competitiveness of the French industrial sector from the mid-1980s has contributed extensively to boosting growth. The French economy grew faster than major euro area economies from 1997 to 2001 (+ 15,4 % in France compared to + 13,4 % in the euro area), while repeatedly recording a large current account surplus. This improvement in our overall cost-competitive situation has progressively materialised into growth, job creations and solid external accounts. Competitiveness is also linked to European ham1onisation in other fields, for example in the service industries. Most of the barriers to trade in services appear to be due to national regulations and should be abolished or alleviated. While the Eurosystem acts mainly as a stimulus in the process of structural reforms, it also plays a leading role in ensuring financial stability. This brings me to the second challenge that EMU will have to take up. Financial stability Like any independent central bank, the Eurosystem has to fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensuring price stability, which is a key condition for sustained growth, and secondly, preserving financial stability, which bas become a critical challenge in a globalized world economy. I insist on the highly complementary nature of these two objectives, as price stability is the foundation on which financial stability is built. The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability_ . The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability has been reviewed m depth at the EU level. In two reports, in April 2000 and April 2001, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) took stock of the supervisory and regulatory mechanisms in the EU and examined the issue of financial crisis management. It concluded that the current arrangements provided a coherent and flexible basis for 11 safeguarding financial stability and recommended a further strengthening of cross-border and cross-sector co-operation. I fully share the assessment put forward in these reports and I would like to stress here the special responsibilities of central banks, due to: their position at the heart of financial systems, their role as liquidity supplier to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions, their contribution to banking supervision and to the safe and efficient functioning of payment systems, and at least for some of them, their contribution to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. To sum up, an institutional framework in which the Eurosystem's responsibilities for monetary policy in the euro area are coupled with extensive supervisory responsibilities of NCBs in domestic markets, and with reinforced co-operation at an area-wide level, seems appropriate to tackle the changes triggered by the current financial trends and the introduction of the euro. Two points of particular relevance for the financial regulatory framework Let me conclude on this important topic by stressing two points of particular relevance for the European financial regulatory framework: There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan can be implemented by 2005. This Plan is regularly reviewed by European authorities, and progress is being made. The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A. Lamfalussy · on the integration of the European securities markets; ratified lW the European Coiuicil meeting in Stockholm in 2001 and approved by the European Parliament in early 2002. We are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help make it possible to take full advantage of the introduction of the euro. In the field of financial regulation and supervision, ECO FIN Council ( December the 3rd 2002) approved a report by the Economic and Financial Committee which made proposals concerning the cooperation structures at the European level for financial regulation and supervision. These new arrangements are now being implemented. In this regard, one of the statutory tasks of the Eurosystem is according to the Treaty, to contribute to the smooth conduct of prudential supervision policies and ' the stability of the financial system. I am therefore convinced that the involvement of central banks in this issue will remain absolutely crucial. 12 Finally, since the tragic events of 11 September and their impact on financial stability, concerns over the potential abuse of the financial system for the financing of terrorism have received top priority in international and European regulatory discussions. The international community and, within it, the financial community, should step up its efforts to hunt down money used by organised crime and terrorism. We shall not be successful overnight, but, today, there is a strong political determination on the part of the international community to co-operate on this issue. As far as the fight against organised crime and terrorism is concerned, we can no longer accept that certain players are not prepared to observe the rules of international legal co-operation. Beyond structural reforms and financial stability, the accession of new Member States to the European Union and to EMU is the third challenge that I have identified. The last challenge but not the least. Accession of new Member States to the EU and EMU Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating accession to the EU, of which ten, according to the calendar endorsed by the European Council, will join the E.U. as early as the 1st of January 2004. This provides further evidence of the attractiveness of the European framework, which has provided us with both political stability and economic progress for half a century. The accession countries have accomplished significant progress in stabilising and strengthening their economies and institutions. Observing the accession countries since the beginning of the nineties, we see the major improvements that these countries have made on the road towards convergence with the EU. Nevertheless, there is also general agreement on the fact that the gap in terms of average GDP per capita between the accession countries and the euro area, although diminishing, still remains quite significant. . . - ~-· . -On average, GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity is around 44% of that of the euro area, while in terms of current exchange rates it is only around 22%. The size of the gap, combined with the limited growth differentials between the two groups of countries, suggests that the process of real convergence will be very gradual. Indeed, real convergence is essential to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States, thereby helping to minimise the risk and the effects of asymetric shocks. The Eurosystem, and notably the Banque de France, is following the enlargement process with a great deal of attention. Let me stress a few points of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and for accession countries themselves, on the road towards catching up with the EU and achieving convergence. - Firstly, nominal convergence, which is requested in order to adopt the euro, must be sustainable and therefore constitutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-term priority. Indeed, the EU Treaty 13 calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of sustainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic, in the interest of both accessing countries and the euro area. Secondly, I note that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed. However, it should be clear that the ERM II is not expected to be adopted by new members immediately after EU accession, nor is intended to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum period of time prior to adopting the euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II is to be considered as a ""training room"". This mechanism will allow countries to retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership also offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for : increasing convergence with the euro area, tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro, contributing to macroeconomic and exchange rate stability, helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixation of parities. This is to be accomplished in the best interest of the candidate countries themselves. Thirdly, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over the past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging structural reforms and foreign ownership. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks that support the banking secto'r are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries . ••• To conclude, let me stress two words: rapidity and stability. Rapidity is a key word. We have not much time to meditate, decide, implement. The structural reforms, that we are badly in need of, must be implemented as rapidly as possible if Europe is to be up to its historical challenges. The Chinese say ""It is later than you think"" has never been so true. In any case, history itself does not wait for us. And when I look back, over the last twenty years, it seems to me that an unfortunately well-founded criticism could be that we have constantly under-assessed the rapidity of the stream of history: the rapidity of the deterioration of the situation in the USSR, the rapidity of the collapse 14 itself, the rapidity of the enlargement process, the depth, the strength and intensity of the ""desire of Europe"", which is spreading over in the countries in transition. Second word: stability. Economic and financial stability, in a period of excessive volatility and of wide boom-bust episode, financial and real stability appear to be a very precious asset. We have built a new world: technology has permitted instantaneous communication and incredibly powerful real-time computation. Globalization has created new cultural, conceptual, commercial and financial links between all economies including previously centrally planned systems; together technology and globalization are progressively driving us to a unified planet of universal rules and regulations, code of conduct and practices, market procedures and market instruments, accounting standards, etc. In this new world, phenomena which had traditionally a local or a national impact may be amplified and become dangerous at the global level: amplification of financial cycles, herd behaviour, global contagion. Analysing the opportunities and the risks, and understanding the functioning of our system with a view to making it as stable as possible is a very exciting, ambitious and urgent task. I thank you for your attention. 15 ","jean-claude trichet",""

LES FONDEMENTS SOLIDES DE L'EURO 1.1.1- CLARTE ET CREDIBILITE DE LA STRATEGIE DE LA POLITIQUE MONETAIRE UNIQUE Le Traite de Maastricht definit clairement l'objectif final de la politique monetaire unique, a savoir le maintien de la stabilite des prix. A cet effet, il est essentiel d'avoir une definition claire de la stabilite des prix. Celle-ci a ete definie par l'Eurosysteme comme une progression sur un an de l'indice des prix a la consommation harmonise (IPCH) dans la zone euro inferieure a 2 %. Le maintien de la stabilite des prix a moyen terme constitue le principal apport de l 'Eurosysteme pour favoriser un environnement propice a une croissance sou tenable et a l' emploi sur le long terme. Il est egalement la meilleure contribution que puisse apporter la politique monetaire afin de limiter d'inutiles fluctuations de la production et de l'emploi acourt terme. Pour atteindre cet objectif, notre strategie de politique monetaire est fondee sur deux « piliers » :- le premier « pilier » est fonde sur une valeur de reference fixee a 4,5 % pour lacroissance annuelle de l'agregat monetaire large M3 - naturellement, nous -2-suivons attentivement les composantes et les contreparties de M3, telles que !'evolution des prets au secteur prive, !'evolution des finances publiques et des mouvements de capitaux avec le reste du monde ; - le second « pilier » se fonde sur une large gamme de variables utilisees commeindicateurs des perspectives d'evolution des prix dans la zone euro.Le succes de notre strategie enregistre jusqu'a present ne signifie pas pour autant que notre politique monetaire actuelle est gravee dans le marbre. Avec le recul dont nous disposons maintenant, l'annee 2003 semble le moment approprie pour dresser le bilan de notre experience et l 'integrer aux differents elements de notre strategie. Cette question fait actuellement l'objet d'etudes approfondies au sein de l'Eurosysteme. Nous avons !'intention d'achever cette evaluation au cours du printemps et de publier ses conclusions. 11 va sans dire que la decision de dresser un bilan approfondi de notre experience ne signifie pas necessairement que des changements substantiels soient envisages. 1.1.2- EFFICIENCE DU CADRE INSTITUTIONNEL ET TECHNIQUE DE LA POLITIQUE MONETAIRE I.1.2.1- L'Eurosysteme constitue un cadre institutionnel solide, comprenant laBCE et les 12 banques centrales des pays membres de la zone euro. Ainsi queles enquetes d 'opinion le montrent, il beneficie du capital de confiance dontdisposent les banques centrales nationales elles-memes.L'Eurosysteme s'articule autour de trois principes: independance, transparence et decentralisation. - 3 -L'independance de la Banque centrale europeenne et des banques centrales nationales est garantie par le Traite. Dans l'exercice de leurs pouvoirs et l' accomplissement de leurs missions, ni les banques centrales de lEurosysteme, ni un membre quelconque de ses organes de decision ne doivent solliciter ou accepter des instructions des institutions communautaires, d'un gouvemement d'un Etat membre ou de tout autre organisme. Le concept d'independance recouvre l'independance institutionnelle, operationnelle et financiere. Nous considerons que ce concept d'independance contribue de fa<U+FFFD>on decisive a la clarte et la credibilite de la politique monetaire unique. Transparence et responsabilite : Les elus, les principaux acteurs economiques ainsi que tous les citoyens europeens doivent etre pleinement informes de la conduite de la politique monetaire unique. Au niveau europeen, la BCE entretient un dialogue permanent avec le Conseil europeen et le Parlement europeen, comme le font les banques centrales nationales avec les institutions de leur pays. La BCE est la seule banque centrale au monde a appliquer le principe d'une communication reguliere, frequente et en temps reel dans le domaine de la politique monetaire. En effet, une fois par mois, a l'issue de la reunion du Conseil des gouvemeurs, le president de la BCE tient une conference de presse qu'il commence par une declarati_on introductive.La responsabilite est la necessaire contrepartie de l'independance d'une banque centrale. A cet egard, les allocutions publiques et les auditions du President de la Banque centrale europeenne et des gouverneurs des banques centrales nationales, a !'intention des institutions et de !'opinion publique, sont essentielles. En effet, notre mission collective consiste en grande partie a expliquer sans relache les raisons et arguments qui sous-tendent les decisions du Conseil des gouverneurs. - 4 -Enfin, la decentralisation : le principe de subsidiarite constitue l'assise de toute la construction europeenne; la decentralisation est done un element majeur de !'architecture de l'Eurosysteme. L'Eurosysteme est une equipe dont les membres travaillent en etroite cooperation dans un esprit constructif. Les decisions de politique monetaire sont prises, au niveau central, par le Conseil des gouverneurs et mises en reuvre par les banques centrales nationales de maniere etroitement coordonnee. Les modalites de vote au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs doivent, vous le savez, etre adaptees a l'elargissement de l'UEM. Le 3 fevrier 2003, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a approuve a l'unanimite une Recommandation du Conseil visant a adapter les modalites de vote au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs a une zone euro elargie, conformement a !'article 10.6 des Statuts introduit par le traite de Nice. Cette decision etait necessaire pour maintenir la capacite du Conseil des gouverneurs a prendre des decisions de maniere efficace et rapide dans un Eurosysteme elargi. La recommandation de la BCE a ete soumise au Conseil de 1 'UE. La Commission europeenne et le Parlement europeen ont recemment rendu publics leurs avis. Nous esperons que Ia proposition du Conseil des gouverneurs sera prochaineinent approuvee par les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement. Cette proposition prevoit que le nombre total de droits de vote au sem du Conseil des gouverneurs sera plafonne a 21, quel que soit le nombre de pays participant a l'Union monetaire. Les six membres du directoire disposeront d'un droit de vote permanent et Jes gouverneurs des BCN se partageront les quinze droits de vote restants qui feront l'objet d'une rotation selon des regles preetablies. Afin de veiller a ce que toute decision prise par le Conseil des gouverneurs soit representative de I' economie de la zone euro dans son ensemble, les gouverneurs seront repartis en groupes caracterises par des - 5 -frequences de vote differentes. La repartition des gouverneurs en groupes sera realisee selon un classement des BCN concernees, refletant principalement !'importance relative des economies et de leurs secteurs financiers. Cette recommandation recente du Conseil des gouvemeurs temoigne de sa capacite a adapter en douceur sa gouvernance interne aux defis poses par I' elargissement. 1.1.2.2- Un cadre technique efficient L'introduction de l'euro sur les marches de capitaux, le l er janvier 1999, a ete un succes indiscutable. 11_ s'agit d'une realisation remarquable dans la mesure ou de nombreux observateurs doutaient du succes immediat d'un defi technique de . cette ampleur. A cet egard, trois orientations ont determine cette reussite - le cadre de la politique monetaire recouvre toute une palette d'instrumentsdont le choix repond a un souci de respect des principes de marche, d 'egalite detraitement, de simplicite et de transparence. La decentralisation de !'executiondes operations de politique monetaire a sans nul doute contribue au bonfonctionnement de ce cadre. Le maintien de contacts etroits entre les banquescommerciales et leurs banques centrales nationales respectives a permis auxmarches de capitaux d'adopter rapidement des pratiques harmonisees s'agissantdes operations d'open market, des garanties eligibles aux operations derefinancement et du mecanisme de reserves obligatoires.- l'efficacite operationnelle est illustree par la precision de l'ajustement de Ialiquidite bancaire et l'efficacite du pilotage des taux d'interet a court terme;l'Eurosysteme a constamment demontre son efficacite en la matiere tout au longdes quatre dernieres annees, et en particulier durant les jours qui ont suivi lesevenements tragiques du 11 septembre 2001, en agissant rapidement et enveillant a garantir le bon fonctionnement des marches de capitaux europeens.- 6 -- la securite est assuree par les procedures et systemes mis en reuvre tant pourI' execution des operations interbancaires que pour les paiements de grosmontant. L'integration du marche interbancaire s'est operee grace a la mise enplace du systeme Target pour le transfert, en temps reel, des paiements demontant eleve dans !'ensemble de la zone euro et dans les autres pays de !'Unioneuropeenne.1.1.3- L'UEM FAVORISE L'INTEGRATION ECONOMIQUE ET FINANCIERE 1.1.3.1- Integration effective des marches de capitaux europeens En 1999, l'un des avantages attendus de !'introduction de l'euro residait dans la perspective d'un approfondissement, d'un elargissement et d'une plus grande integration des marches de capitaux, evolutions de nature a reduire le cofit du capital pour les entreprises et a offrir aux epargnants europeens une palette accrue d'options susceptibles d'etre utilisees pour leurs placements. Ces perspectives sont desormais reelles, tant sur le marche monetaire que sur les autres compartiments des marches de capitaux. Sur le marche monetaire de l'euro, !'integration du marche interbancaire des depots en blanc est tres elevee. L 'Eonia et l'Euribor constituent des taux de reference unanimement reconnus par l 'ensemble des operateurs, comme l 'atteste la tres forte progression du marche des swaps de taux d'interet en euros. - 7 -Sur le marche obligataire de I' euro, la concurrence entre emetteurs a ete renforcee, ce qui a favorise I 'harmonisation des differents compartiments de titres souverains, la convergence progressive vers les « meilleures pratiques » et le developpement de plusieurs emprunts de reference attractifs et activement negocies (titres souverains notamment). En outre, la concurrence a pernus d'ameliorer la liquidite, les emetteurs ayant accru le montant moyen de leur encours. La modernisation des structures de marche a ete poursmv1e : outre le developpement du courtage electronique ( e-trading), le mouvement de concentration observe chez les depositaires centraux de titres favorise un fonctionnement plus efficient des procedures de reglement-Iivraison ainsi que la mise en reuvre de modalites de reglement plus simples et plus sores des operations transfrontiere sur titres. Ce demier point est particulierement important pour l 'Eurosysteme, le bon fonctionnement de I 'infrastructure de reglement des titres etant essentiel a la mise en reuvre de la politique monetaire. Sur le marche des actions, les marches raisonnent dorenavant au mveau europeen. L'elimination du risque de change entre les differents pays de la zone euro a en effet amene les investisseurs a renforcer la composante internationale et sectorielle dans leurs choix de portefeuille et a ne plus se limiter a une optique nationale. La creation d'une large gamme d'indices sectoriels paneuropeens a ete une consequence directe de ces modifications de la strategie des investisseurs. - 8 -I.1.3.2- Concentration du secteur financier:En outre, l'euro a constitue un important element catalyseur de l'activite de fusion et acquisition dans le secteur financier. A cet egard, il convient de souligner la vague de fusions ou d'alliances intervenant actuellement au sein des banques, bourses de valeurs, systemes de reglement de titres et chambres de compensation. Si l'euro n'avait pas ete cree, aurait-on pu envisagerEuronext, resultat de la fusion entre les Bourses d 'Amsterdam, de Bruxelles, de Lisbonne et de Paris? 1.2. LE ROLE INTERNATIONAL DE L'EURO, UN DEVELOPPEMENT INCONTESTABLE MAIS PROGRESSIF Tout d'abord, il faut souligner que le role international de l'euro n'est pas un objectif en soi pour l'Eurosysteme. Ce dernier observe une position de neutralite face a son developpement, c'est-a-dire qu'il ne l'empeche ni ne !'encourage. Le developpement du role international de l'euro est un processus de long terme, qui implique une modification en profondeur du comportement des agents. Cependant, on enregistre d'ores et deja quelques evolutions significatives. I.2.1- LE DEVELOPPEMENT DE L'UTILISATION INTERNATIONALE PRIVEEDEL'EURO L'euro est tout d'abord utilise au plan international comme instrument financier. Son utilisation com.me monnaie de financement a connu une evolution marquee. II constitue ainsi la seconde monnaie d'emission de titres sur le marche international. La part de l'euro dans les emissions de titres sur le marche - 9 -international ( definition large) atteignait 39 % au second trimestre 2002 ( contre 45 % pour le dollar US et 6 % pour le yen), en augmentation de 11 points de pourcentage par rapport a la part totale des anciennes monnaies nationales plus l'ecu a la fin de 1998 (statistiques BRI et Rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). L'utilisation de l'euro comme monnaie de placement s'est accrue egalement de fagon notable. La part de l'euro dans les actifs bancaires internationaux se montait a 24 % a la fin du ler trimestre 2002 (contre 52 % pour le dollar et 11 % pour le yen), soit une augmentation de 6 points de pourcentage par rapport a la date de lancement de l'euro (source: Rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). L' euro est egalement utilise au plan international comme intermediaire dans les echanges et unite de compte. C'est tout d'abord une monnaie « vehicule »essentielle sur le marche des changes. L' euro est en effet intervenu dans 1/Seme des transactions de change classiques en 2001(statistiques BR!) et le couple euro/dollar fait l'objet des transactions les plus importantes, avec 30 % des vol<U+FFFD>mes globaux recenses en 2001. L'utilisation de l' euro comme monna1e de facturation du commerce international s'accroit, meme s'il est difficile de trouver des donnees agregees et harmonisees pour la zone euro dans son ensemble sur cet aspect. Entre 2001 et mi-2002, la part de l'euro dans le commerce exterieur de biens et services de lazone euro a augmente de fac;on significative, surtout avec les zones geographiquement les plus proches, pour atteindre globalement une part comprise entre 40 % et 50 % ( source : Quarterly Review of the use of the euro, · Commission, donnees reprises dans le rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). - 10 -1.2.2- LE ROLE INTERNATIONAL OFFICIEL DE L'EUROL'euro est une monnaie de reference pour de nombreux regimes de change adoptes par des pays tiers: plus de 50 pays ont adopte l'euro comme reference ou ancre monetaire, plus particulierement dans les zones geographiques proches. C'est egalement la seconde monnaie dans les reserves de change mondiales: sa part s 'etablissait a 13 % a la fin 2001 ( donnees FMI), contre 68 % pour le dollar et 5 % pour le yen. En outre, en 2002, plusieurs communiques de presse et declarations officielles de divers pays, notamment la Chine, la Coree, la Russie, le Pakistan et la Roumanie, ont fait etat de !'augmentation par ces pays de la part de l'euro dans leurs reserves de change ou de leur intention d'aller dans ce sens. II. MEME SI LES NECESSllRES REFORMES STRUCTURELLES DOIVENT ENCORE ETRE POURSUIVIES, L'UEM CONST ITUE D'ORES ET DEJA UNE ZONE COMPETITIVE E-:C:.COHERENTE ' 11.1- NECESSITE DE POURSUIVRE LES REFORMES STRUCTURELLES Le passage a !'Euro a constitue en soi une reforme structurelle majeure et un puissant facteur de modernisation de l 'economie europeenne. Pour continuer dans cette voie, l'accroissement de la competitivite globale de nos economies passe par la moderation des couts unitaires de production. Si l'on se rapporte a !'experience economique recente de Ia France la strate!rie' e, fran<U+FFFD>aise dite de desinflation competitive nous a donne un tres grand avantage:-11 --------- -------les gains importants de competitivite-cofit emegistres dans le secteur industriel fram;ais a partir du milieu des annees quatre-vingt ont en effet largement contribue a favoriser la croissance, les creations d'emplois et la solidite des comptes exterieurs. La poursuite d'une strategie de desinflation competitive au niveau de la zone euro doit s'appuyer sur un ensemble de reformes sur le marche du travail et sur le marche des biens. 11.1.1- NECESSITE DE PROMOUVOm IA FLEXIBILITE DU MARCHE DU TRA VAIL Globalement, on peut estimer que le chomage reste a 70 % de nature structurelle, que la differenciation des salaires entre secteurs demeure insuffisante, et que le cout du travail s'avere encore trop eleve. Dans ce domaine, les reformes principales a mener concement : - l' augmentation de la quantite de travail disponible: le Conseil europeen deLisbonne en mars 2000 a fixe comme objectif central d'elever le taux d'emploi de nos populations de 61 a 70 % en 10 ans, sachant qu'il avoisine 75 % aux Etats-Unis ; - la suppression des trappes a inactivite et a pauvrete, par la reduction descontributions sociales a la charge des employeurs et le developpement de la formation; - le developpement des deux principaux mecanismes d'adaptation que sont laflexibilite des salaires et la mobilite du travail. 11.1.2- NECESSITE D'HARMONISER L'ENVIRONNEMENT REGLEMENTAIRE CONCURRENTIEL ET FISCAL, SUR LE MARCHE DES BIENS ET SERVICES --------- · . <U+FFFD> --- --12 -De son cote, !'integration progressive du marche europeen des biens et services se poursuit. On peut ici evoquer le renouvellement des reglementations relatives aux marches des telecommunications, de l'electricite et du gaz. Toutefois, on note que seuls 7 pays de la zone ont atteint le taux de transposition des directives europeennes cible pour 2002, soit 98,5%. L'effort de transposition doit done etre poursuivi. En outre, des efforts supplementaires doivent etre accomplis pour : - simplifier et harmoniser I' environnement reglementaire, dans le domaine desservices aux entreprises et aux particuliers ; - soutenir le developpement des petites et moyennes entreprises ;- favoriser !'acceleration des gains de productivite du travail (modernisation dessystemes d 'information) ; - soutenir les efforts de Recherche et Developpement: investissements,chercheurs - diminuer les subventions publiques.II.2- ... L'UEM EST UNE ZONE COMPETITIVE ET COHERENTEIl.2.1- L'UEM PRESENTE UN HAUT NIVEAU DE COMPETITIVITE, EN MATIEREDE PRIX ET DE COUT La zone euro et la France sont particulierement attractives, du fait de fondamentaux macroeconomiques sains et de !'absence de desequilibres majeurs. Le niveau d'inflation y est faible et stable sur le long terme, les comptes extemes sont equilibres, I' epargne privee est abondante, et le systeme financier - 13 -est sain, comme l'etablit le rapport du Comite de Surveillance Bancaire du SEBC (BSC), publie en fevrier 2003. La qualite de la main d'reuvre europeenne est un autre atout d'importance, avec le haut niveau d'education et de formation observe (5% du PIB consacre a!'education), ainsi que la maitrise affichee des langues etrangeres. La qualite des infrastructuresn'est pas en reste, que ce soit en matiere de transports, d'energie, de telecommunications ou de nouvelles technologies. Tous ces facteurs contribuent a expliquer la bonne tenue des flux d'investissements directs vers la zone euro et plus particulierement vers la France. Selon les donnees de la Balance des Paiements, la France est le zcme pays d'accueil des investissements directs en 2002 apres la Chine, avec 49,9 Mds EUR. Depuis la mise en place de l'euro, au debut de 1999, le total des investissements directs etrangers en France s'eleve ainsi a environ 200 Mds EUR, ce qui traduit une nette progession par rapport aux annees precedentes. Les investissements directs etrangers dans la zone euro, pour leur part, ont represente 720 Mds EUR entre 1999 et 2001, et 85 Mds EUR sur les 8 premiers mois de 2002. 11.2.2- L' ARCHITECTURE FINANCIERE COMMUNE RENFORCE LA STABILITE .ECONOMIQUE ET FINANCIERE DE LA ZONE EURO L'Eurosysteme a salue la decision du Conseil europeen de Lisbonne en mars 2000 consistant a accelerer la realisation du marche interieur des services financiers et visant a mettre en reuvre le Plan d 'action sur Ies servicesfinanciers d'ici 2005. Ce Plan est regulierement passe en revue par Ies autorites europeennes et des progres importants ont ete realises : a fin 2002, 32 chapitres -14 -sur 42 ont en effet ete mis en reuvre, dont notamment le reglement sur les paiements transfrontaliers en euro (2001), le statut de Societe europeenne et la Directive de decembre 2002 sur les conglomerats financiers. La zone euro beneficie, par ailleurs, de mecanismes reglementaires prudentiels coherents et flexibles, comme I'ont etabli deux rapports du Comite econornique et financier (avril 2000 et avril 2001). Ces mecanismes permettent de mesurer et de limiter les risques d'instabilite au sein du secteur bancaire, du secteur des assurances et sur le marche des titres. En outre, une nouvelle architecture institutionnelle est en cou.rs de constitution dans I'U.E. dans le domaine de la reglementation et de la supervision du secteur financier (banques, assurances, marches de titres). L'Eurosysteme a soutenu les conclusions du Comite preside par A.Lamfalussy sur I 'integration des marches de titres europeens ; nous sommes convaincus que la mise en reuvre - decidee a Ia fin de 2002 - de ces grandes orientations dans I' ensemble du secteur financier, et les nouvelles structures de cooperation au niveau europeen qui en decoulent, contribueront a renforcer la stabilite du systeme financier. La stabilite financiere peut ainsi etre consideree comme la deuxieme mission confiee a l'Eurosysteme par le Traite. Plus speciquement, le Traite prevoit que l'Eurosysteme doit contribuer a Ia bonne conduite des politiques en matiere prudentielle et a la stabilite du systeme financier. Les responsabilites particulieres des banques centrales decoulent de leur positionnement au creur des systemes financiers: leur role de fournisseur de liquidite de l'economie, Ieurs contacts etroits et constants avec Jes etablissements de credit, leur contribution a la surveillance bancaire et au - 15 -fonctionnement sfu et efficient des systemes de paiement et, au moins pour certaines d 'entre elles, leur contribution a un fonctionnement sfir et efficient des systemes de compensation et de reglement de titres. Je suis convaincu que la participation des banques centrales, dans ces domaines, demeurera absolument essentielle. En matiere de lutte contre le blanchiment, enfin, la Cooperation juridique internationale s'intensifie. Depuis les tragiques evenements du 11 septembre, les inquietudes relatives a la possible utilisation du systeme financier pour financer le terrorisme sont devenues prioritaires dans les debats internationaux et europeens sur la reglementation. La communaute internationale, et en son sein, la communaute financiere, renforce ses efforts pour traquer les fonds utilises par le crime organise et le terrorisme. Nous progressons car il existe aujourd'hui, une forte determination politique de la communaute internationale et des instances europeennes competentes, en faveur d'une cooperation sur cette question. Face a ce defi majeur pour la cohesion de la zone euro, celle-ci dispose de divers instruments de coordination. - 16 -ill.I- LA ZONE EURO DISPOSE D'UN CADRE DE POLITIQUE ECONOMIQUE A MOYEN TERME ASSURANT SA COHESION INTERNE. III.1.1- DES PROCEDURES MULTIIATERALES INSTITUTIONNALISEESUn cadre operationnel coherent a ete mis en place pour la coordination des politiques economiques par la voie d'une surveillance mutuelle etroite, sous la responsabilite de l 'Eurogroupe et du Conseil Ecofin. En encadrant les deficits publics des Etats membres de la zone euro, lePacte de Stabilite et de Croissance permet de coordonner les politiques budgetaires. C'est la un complement indispensable a la politique monetaire, notamment pour contrebalancer le fait que !'Europe ne dispose pas d'un important budget federal. En instituant un systeme de sanctions en cas de deficits excessifs, le Pacte contribue egalement a eviter que des economies bien gerees n'aient a supporter une prime de risque injustifiee, en provenance des economies presentant d'importants deficits, et qui serait transferee sur elles par le canal de la monnaie unique. En outre, les Grandes orientations de politique economique, approuvees chaque annee par les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement, contribuent au suivi des evolutions macroeconomiques et structurelles dans les Etats membres. Elles n'ont pas a proprement parler de valeur contraignante, puisque leur non-respect ne donne pas lieu a des sanctions. Elles constituent cependant un instrument central dans la coordination des politiques economiques, dont le contenu s'est precise au fil des annees. Elles sont par ailleurs adoptees par le Conseil ECOFIN, ce qui permet a la pression des pairs de s'exer<U+FFFD>er. - 17 -111.1.2- LA PRISE EN COMPTE DES CHOCS ASYMETRIQUES En pressant les pays de parvenir, a moyen terme, a une situation budgetaire « proche de l'equilibre ou en excedent », le Pacte tolere une augmentation des deficits en periode difficile, a condition de ne pas depasser la valeur de reference de 3 %. En bref, il autorise les pays membres a creer un « volant de securite »budgetaire durant les phases de conjoncture economique normales, susceptible d'etre utilise pour faire face a des divergences economiques ou a des chocs asymetriques. ill.1.3- LA CONVERGENCE DES ECONOMIES DE IA ZONE EURO L'Union monetaire n'implique pas necessairement que tous les pays participants affichent, a tout moment, le meme taux d'inflation ou de croissance, meme si la creation de l'euro reposait sur la reussite du processus de convergence. Ainsi des ecarts d'inflation entre pays ou regions sent acceptables dans une union monetaire car ils s 'integrent dans le processus de convergence de la productivite et des niveaux de vie. En fait, la dispersion d'inflation entre pays de la zone euro est similaire a celle constatee entre les differents etats des Etats-Unis. Une zone monetaire est jugee optimale si et seulement si il y a une forte correlation des cycles economiques dans les pays membres, une libre circulation des facteurs de production ou un budget federal suffisant pour amortir les chocs. En pratique, les structures economiques doivent aussi etre suffisamment - 18 -. a la politique monetairesemblables pour que la reaction de l'econom1e b 1 t 1 zone euro correspond acommune soit similaire entre les pays.

Les pays candidats a l'elargissement doivent prendre toute la mesure de cette. , · C'est sans doute la un enjeucontrainte avant de rentrer en Uruon monetaue. important des prochaines annees. ID.2- LA REUSSITE DURABLE DE L'ELARGISSEMENT SUPPOSE LA CONVERGENCE DES STRUCTURES ECONO111QUES ET FINANCIERES DES PAYS CANDIDATS. m.2.1.- IA CONVERGENCE REELLE, UN PROCESSUS PROGRESSIF ET DE LONGTERMELa convergence reelle correspond a la fois au processus de convergence des revenus reels, mais aussi au processus de convergence structurelle et institutionnelle, qm implique. !'adaptation des structures economiques, l'etablissement d'institutions adequates, !'adoption des pratiques et standards reconnus intemationalement. A ce titre, l'integration economique deja importante des pays candidats avec la zone euro constitue un point positif: Ia zone euro absorbe 58 % des exportations totales des pays candidats ( contre un commerce intra qui represente 50,4 % des exportations des actuels Etats membres de la zone euro) ; les pays candidats absorbent 13 % du total des exportations de la zone euro (part identique a celle des Etats-Unis) et ant contribue pour les 2/3 a la croissance de la demande exterieure globale adressee a la zone en 2000-01. - 19 -Toutefois, l'ecart en termes de PIB moyen par habitant entre les pays candidats1 et la moyenne de la zone euro demeure encore tres important. Le PIB moyen par habitant dans les pays candidats en 2002 ne represente en effet que 44 % de la moyenne de la zone euro, en parite de pouvoir d'achat, et 20 % sur la base des taux de change courants. Or, le differentiel de croissance entre Jes pays candidats et Ia zone euro reste encore limite et ne permet pas un rattrapage rapide du niveau de vie. Ce differentiel de croissance ne s'est eleve qu'a 0,5 point par an en moyenne en 1999-2001. En 2002, il a certes progresse pour s'etablir entre 1,3 et 1,7 point, la croissance du PIB ayant ete estimee a 2,3 % dans les pays candidats contre 0,6/1 % dans la zone euro ( estimations Eurostat et BCE). A ce rythme, en moyenne, les pays candidats ne rattraperaient le niveau relatif de la Grece qu'en 2025. Bien sur, les situations individuelles sont tres differenciees. C'est pourquoi les reformes structurelles revetent egalement une importance cruciale pour les pays candidats, en ce qui conceme notamment le marche du travail et la qualite des systemes bancaires, ceci afin de creer les conditions d'un rattrapage plus rapide. . ·- - -<U+FFFD>. -- - . . . -ill.2.2- L'IMPORTANCE DE SYSTEMES BANCAIRES ET FINANCIERS SAINS, EFFICACES ET BIEN SUPERVISES Le processus de liberalisation des mouvements de capitaux en cours dans les pays candidats implique la mise en reuvre de reformes structurelles dans le secteur financier et un renforcement de la supervision. A cet egard, la I Les 10 fulurs Elats mcmbres en 2004: Chypre, Eslonie, Hongrie, Lenonie, Lituanic, Malle, Pologne, Republique slovaque, Rcpublique tchcque el Slovcnie ; enlrcc prcvue de la Bulgarie el Roumanie en 2007. - 20-restructuration et la consolidation des systemes financiers et bancaires, deja bien avancees, doivent etre poursuivies par les pays candidats. Le ratio actifs bancaires/PIB ne represente en effet en moyenne qu'un quart de celui de la zone euro et s'echelonne de 27 % en Lituanie a 389 % a Malte en 2001, contre 265 % pour la zone euro (source: Accession Briefing 2002, BCE). Le ratio credit interieur/PIB ne represente en moyenne qu'un tiers de celui de la zone euro ; il s'etablit en 2001 entre 11,5 % en Lituanie et 109 % a Chypre et Malte, contre 107 % pour la zone euro (source: Accession Briefing 2002, BCE). Les marches financiers sont encore peu developpes. Le ratio capitalisation boursiere /PIB s'eleve en 2001 a 14 % en Pologne, 16 % en Republique tcheque, 19 % en Hongrie, contre 72 % pour la zone euro. ill.2.3- LA CONVERGENCE LEGALE ET INSTITUTIONNELLE, UN PROCESSUS FAISANT L'OBJET D'UN SUIVI ATIENTIF L'Eurosysteme prete naturellement une attention toute particuliere al'independance des banques centrales, qui est un des aspects de la convergence legale et institutionnelle. II s'agit la d'une exigence juridique prealable pour l'entree dans l'UE, et a fortiori dans l <U+FFFD>urosysteme. L'independance implique ala fois la mise en conformite du statut de la banque centrale avec les dispositions communautaires et une mise en reuvre effective. 11 est encourageante de noter que les reformes legislatives engagees ces deux dernieres annees dans Ies pays candidats ont, dans l 'ensemble, permis de rendre les statuts des banques centrales globalement compatibles avec l'acquis communautaire. - 21 -ID.3- LA CONVERGENCE NOMINALE DOIT REPOSER SUR DES STRATEGIES SOUTENABLES Tous les nouveaux Etats membres de l'UE ont vocation a adopter a terme l'euro, des lors qu'ils auront rempli les criteres prevus par le Traite, de maniere soutenable. Leurs efforts devront done porter, tant sur les finances publiques que sur la politique de desinflation et les strategies de change. lli.3.1- AMELIORER IA SITUATION BUDGETAIRE ET EXTERIEURE DES PAYSCANDIDATS Les finances publiques de plusieurs pays candidats soot sous tension. Le deficit public moyen pondere s'est eleve a 3,6 % du PIB en 2001, avec des valeurs allant jusqu'a 5,3 % du PIB en Pologne ou 4 % en Slovaquie. La maitrise des depenses publiques constitue une necessite absolue pour respecter le critere nominal de Maastricht relatif au deficit public, d'autant plus que ces pays devront par ailleurs financer d'importants besoins d'investissements (notamment publics) afin d'assurer la convergence reelle avec la zone euro. En outre, la structure· fiscale actuelle des· pays candidats, caracterisee par la pression· croissante des transferts sociaux et le poids des depenses liees, limite la marge de manreuvre pour une reduction des depenses publiques. Le creusement des deficits courants doit etre egalement maitrise. Le deficit courant moyen a atteint 4,6 % du PIB en 2002, avec des valeurs allant jusqu'a 9,4 % du PIB en Lettonie, 8,1 % en Slovaquie, 6,8 % en Estonie. La projection du deficit courant moyen en 2003 s'etablit a 4,7 % (source: Accession Briefing2002, BCE). La reduction des deficits courants est d'autant plus importante dans - 22 -• la perspective de la perte, a terme, de !'instrument du taux de change, a la suitede l'entree en Union monetaire. ill.3.2- ASSURER LA SOUTENABILITE DU PROCESSUS DE CONVE RGENCE NOMINALE Le processus de desinflation se poursuit dans les pays candidats. II constitue lagrande reussite de la decennie passee, marquee par le passage d 'une inflation moyenne de 2 a 1 chiffres (8,5 % en 2001 en moyenne ). En 2002, le niveau d'inflation moyen dans les pays candidats a continue de se rapprocher du taux d'inflation moyen dans la zone euro ( 4,0 % dans les pays candidats au 3eme trimestre 2002 contre 2,1 % dans la zone euro). Les processus de convergence reelle et nominale sont complementaires. D'unepart, la convergence reelle favorise la conve rgence nominale. En effet, les reformes structurelles conduisent a un environnement de taux d'inflation etd'interet plus faibles et permettent une amelioration des conditions de l'offre de l 'economie ainsi qu 'un accroissement du potentiel de croissance. Par ailleurs, la convergence <U+FFFD>ee!J.e entraine u_ne reduction des risques et des effets de chocs asymetriques. D'autre part, la convergence nominale favorise la convergence reelle en assurant un ancrage des anticipations d 'inflation et la stabilite de l' environnement ma_croeconomique, et en encourageant le commerce et l 'investissement.Par consequent, les convergences reelle et nominale doivent etre poursuivies en parallele. II convient en particulier de ne pas se focaliser en premier lieu sur une convergence nominale trop rapide, faite au detriment de la convergence structurelle, et qui risquerait de ne pas etre soutenable dans la duree. Les- 23 -marches financiers peuvent egalement contribuer a une convergence artificielle de certaines variables nominales, a travers les « convergence plays», c'est-a­dire les anticipations d'une date d'entree precise de tel ou tel pays dans la zone euro. Ces anticipations sont facteurs de risques, car elles peuvent par exemple contribuer a une convergence sur les marches des taux d'interet a long terme vers les niveaux prevalant dans la zone euro, qui serait prematuree car non justifiee par une convergence des fondamentaux economiques. Ce risque ne doit pas etre sous-estime. On a ainsi pu relever, tres recemment, un spread de taux d'interet negatif entre les obligations a 8 ans du Tresor tcheque et les obligations du Bund allemand (-14 points de base au 06/02/03). La poursuite en parallele des convergence reelle et nominale est d'autant plus necessaire qu'il convient d'assurer la soutenabilite de la convergence nominale. En effet, conformement au Traite, !'examen des criteres de convergence economique en vue de I' entree en zone euro donnera lieu a une evaluation du caractere soutenable des resultats obtenus dans les differents domaines (inflation, finances publiques, taux d'interet). ill.3.3- IMPORTANCE PRIMORDIALE DES STRATEGIES DE CHANGE DANS LE MAINTIEN DE IA STABILITE MACROECONOMIQUE Les strategies de change suivies par les pays candidats se caracterisent par leurgrande variete actuelle, des currency boards (Bulgarie, Estonie, Li tuanie) auflottement (Pologne, Republique tcheque) en passant par un regime de bandes defluctuation (+/- 15%) autour d'une parite fixe par rapport a I'euro (Chypre,Hongrie depuis 2001). On note que les monnaies des pays candidats (a !'exception naturellement des currency boards) enregistrent actuellement de fortes fluctuations nominales par- 24-rapport a l'euro, en particulier le zloty polonais, le forint hongrois et la couronne tcheque. Apres l'entree dans l'UE, la politique de change reste une competence nationale, mais doit s'inscrire dans le cadre de l'objectif de stabilite des prix. Dans cette phase, la participation au nouveau mecanisme de change europeen (MCE 2) apparait particulierement utile, comme instrument de convergence assurant un dosage adequat de discipline et de flexibilite. Le MCE 2 doit ainsi etre considere comme une salle d 'entrainement ( « training room ») et non une simple salle d'attente avant !'adoption de l'euro («waiting room»). 11 doit notamment permettre un apprentissage progressif de !'abandon de !'instrument de change: il constitue en effet un cadre institutionnel souple, car il permet les realignements de taux de change et assoit la credibilite du processus de stabilisation progressive du change par son caractere multilateral. Le MCE2 presente par ailleurs des avantages plus fondamentaux : il assure en particulier l'ancrage des anticipations d'inflation des agents, et par la meme incite aux reformes structurelles pour preserver la competitivite. La participation au MCE 2 est egalement un critere de convergence. Le Traite prevoit precisement deux exigences en ce domaine: le respect des marges normales de fluctuation prevues par le MCE 2 pendant 2 ans au moins, sans devaluation; le caractere durable de la convergence atteinte etde la participation au MCE 2, qui se reflete dans les niveaux des taux d'interet a long terme. La participation au MCE 2 constitue done une periode de test pour le cours pivot choisi et la soutenabilite de la convergence. Elle permet en particulier de definir la parite appropriee pour !'adoption, a terme, de l'euro. - 25 -------------II convient de noter que !'evaluation du critere de stabilite du change sera basee, comme cela a ete le cas depuis 1998, sur la proximite entre le taux de change et le cours-pivot, et pas seulement sur le respect de la marge de fluctuation standard de+/- 15 %. D'une maniere generale, on peut estimer que les differents pays devront suivre une approche au cas par cas, tant pour la decision relative a la date d'entree dans le MCE 2 que pour la duree de leur participation. Ces decisions devront etre prises en fonction des conditions economiques (en termes nominaux, reels et structurels ), de la coherence du policy mix, de la taille, des structures economiques et du track record du pays concerne. En effet, une entree prematuree dans le MCE2 pourrait causer une accentuation de la volatilite du change et entrainer un risque de crise et de contagion. Enfin, en ce qui conceme la duree de participation, il apparait particulierement dangereux de faire d'une reforme fondamentale telle que !'adoption de l'euro, un simple objectif de court terme. Je vous remercie. - 26 -","jean-claude trichet",""

Mme Nathalie AUFAUVRE Le 23 novembre 2009 Chere Nth 1. a a Ie Aufauvre , Votre disc 't' · ' b' I re ion et votre modestie sont legendaires. Et pourtant, ce so1r, c est 1en vous que a Republique et la Banque de France ont souhaite honorer a !'occasion de la remise de cette decoration qui, a juste titre, vous a ete decemee en mai demi er. Re~ue a un rang tres honorable au concours d'adjoint de direction de 1983, vous integrez la Banque de France le ler fevrier 1984. Votre promotion ne compte que 5 femmes pour 27 hommes. On est loin alors de la parite dont on s'est beaucoup rapproche ces dernieres annees (12 femmes pour 13 hommes en 2008). Oserai-je dire que, avec une simple licence de sciences economiques, vous etes alors ... la moins diplomee ? Mais vous vous rattraperez vite. J'y reviendrai. Apres Ia scolarite a l'IDEF et un stage en succursale a Neuilly-Levallois, vous integrez les services de la Balance des Paiements a la DGSE ou vous vous faites immediatement remarquer pour votre sens des relations humaines et vos qualites de plume. Tout en travaillant a la Banque vous poursuivez vos etudes pour obtenir d'abord votre maitrise de sciences econorniques et, dans la foulee, vous poursuivez par le cursus de l'IEP de paris, section economique et financiere, dont vous obtiendrez le diplome en 1990, major avec les felicitations du jury. C'est-a-dire, dans la botte des tout premiers re~us au diplome de Sciences-Po. Entre temps, vous avez quitte les services de la Balance des Paiements et rejoint le service des Changes ou vous serez la premiere femme dans le milieu tres masculin des cambistes qui, parait-il ont pu avoir, pour certains d'entre eux au moins, un regard un peu narquois a votre arrivee. Vous saurez pourtant tres vite vous imposer et en imposer. Non seulement par votre sens du marche, votre connaissance des techniques financieres et votre grande maitrise des outils informatiques. Mais aussi par la qualite de vos analyses, votre esprit positif et constructif et, ici encore, vos qualites humaines, que remarque l'un de vos notateurs d'alors, Jean-Paul Redouin. Votre sang froid et votre flegme sont particulierement apprecies, notamment aux moments de tension sur les marches. Vous poursuivez ainsi votre carriere a la direction du marche des capitaux, jusqu'a occuper, aupres d'Isabelle Strauss Khan, les fonctions d'adjointe du directeur des Operation de Marche. A la demande de M. Bruneel, vous presidez de main de maitre le groupe de reflexion sur le Metier 6, compose de 4 hommes et 4 femmes, qui a debouche, grace a votre force de conviction, sur la fusion au debut des annees 2000 des salles de marche « franc » et «devises» et la creation de la direction du back-office au sein de la Direction generale des operations. Non sans tact, vous avez contribue a faire tomber barrieres et frontieres ... notamment les plus etanches et les plus difficiles a ebranler : celles qui sont dans les tetes. De meme, vous avez assure une mission d'expertise remarquable au moment du passage a l'Euro. En depit d'un pouce casse, vous avez bien redige et mene a bien cette tache, a la grande satisfaction de Xavier Debonneuil. Comment avez-vous fait ? 2 . 'b . , · te a la demande de M. Robert, a Je mentionnerai auss1, en passant, votre contr1 ut10n emmen , un rapport sur la crise de 1992. ' h' · · 1 t"" h sans vous departir du calme qui vous Vous avez montre que vous ne rec 1gruez pas a a ac e caracterise, tout en jouant collectif et en valorisant !es potentiels. Vous avez aussi fait montre d'une tres grande capacite d'anticipation. Qualite eminente, qui se revele fort utile dans !es importantes fonctions que vous occupez aujourd'hui a la tete de la Direction financiere et du controle de gestion. Ace titre, vous gerez le budget de la Banque : ses depenses mais aussi ses recettes. Vous participez notamment au comite des risques et au comite de gestion actif-passif ou se revelent vos qualites analytiques et votre capacite a donner au Gouvernement de Ia Banque des conseils avises. S'ajoute a, vos fonctions une dimension europeenne puisque vous participez activement a plusieurs comites du SEBC aux noms un peu etranges : AMICO, BUCOM et COMCO. Ainsi, apres avoir demontre en debut de carriere que vous saviez bien ecrire, , vous prouvez aujourd'hui que vous savez compter et bien compter, ce qui est tres rassurant pour le Gouvemement de Ia Banque. Bien que vous soyez per~ue par tous comme calme et discrete, ii se dit qu'a !'occasion de vos deplacements professionnels, vous vous laissez aller parfois a quelques excentricites, que I'on a peine a imaginer. Ainsi, a Chypre, ii vous est arrive, m'a-t-on rapporte, de participer a Ia danse du verre, Ia « datsia » : on a du mal a vous imaginer perchee sur une chaise en train d'empiler, sur fond musical, verres sur verres (pleins evidemment) sur la tete du danseur. Et pourtant, vous I'avez fait, sans rien renverser, a Ia grande admiration de vos collegues des 3 autres banques centrales. Encore, une preuve de votre sens de l'equilibre. Et en plus, nous voila rassure sur votre sens de la rete. Cela me fournit une bonne transition pour parler maintenant un peu plus de votre personnalite. Je souhaite d'abord saluer votre epoux qui etait de la meme promotion d' AD que vous (il a quitte la Banque depuis). II se disait, parmi les autres jeunes femmes, que vous « aviez recupere le plus beau de la promotion». Voila qui est flatteur pour lui, vexant sans doute pour les autres . . . mais qui revele bien vos qualites de fraicheur et de seduction. Votre calme apparent cache un caractere bien trempe, parfois meme une « tete de pioche ». C'est ainsi que, toute jeune deja, brillante eleve au lycee, admise en prepa HEC a Janson de Sailly vous aviez renonce a vous presenter au concours des grandes ecoles de commerce. Apres avoir envisage de vous lancer dans l'archeologie apres un voyage en Crete, ou de devenir chanteuse de varietes ou de rock, vous aviez finalement opte pour les etudes en economie puis le concours de la Banque. Certains se souviennent encore du discours de fin de promotion d' AD3 que vous avez prepare et declame avec une de vos collegues. II ne manquait, parait-il, pas d'humour ni de causticite. Je voudrais saluer egalement votre attachement a votre famille. Votre maman trop tot disparue, votre pere ici present, vos freres aines. Vos trois enfants Jeanne, Camille et Alexandre dont vous etes si proche, peuvent etre tiers de leur maman qui, non sans mal parfois, concilie une attention toute particuliere a leur egard et une implication sans faille dans son travail. Je n'oublie pas votre epoux, tres investi egalement dans sa vie professionnelle. Je 4 I crois que vous . avez tous trouve sur l'Ile de Re le lieu de vos reves, devenu le site des ' retrouvailles en f: ·11 , rum e ou vous pratiquez velo et la marche a pied. Chere Nathalie Aufauvre, permettez-moi egalement d'evoquer le souvenir de votre grand-mere matemelle, Luce O'Diette, dont vous etiez tres proche et avec qui, je le sais, vous avez beaucoup discute et partage une grande complicite. Epouse d'un officier de cavalerie, tombe au front dans la Somme en 1940, elle s' etait engagee dans la Resistance en fabriquant notarnment des faux papiers a la Prefecture de Nantes ou elle avait ete recrutee pour gagner sa vie. Arretee et deportee a Ravensbruck, rapatriee sur un brancard, constatant a son retour a Nantes, la destruction de sa maison, revenue a Paris, elle a repris vie et combat pour finalement disparaitre en 1981, centenaire. Elle etait titulaire de la Croix de Guerre et Officier de la Legion d'Honneur. Je ne doute pas que l'exemple de sa determination, de son experience, de sa sagesse et de sa hauteur de vue vous guide dans la vie. Permettez-moi enfin d'evoquer un autre de vos tres lointains ancetres par votre grand-pere matemel. Je veux parler du Baron Jean-Charles Joachim Davillier qui fut Gouverneur de la Banque de France du 12 fevrier au 5 septembre 1836 et siegea 45 ans au Conseil de Regence, de 1801 a sa mort en 1846. Peu d'agents de la Banque peuvent aujourd'hui se prevaloir d'un ancetre gouvemeur ... Je souhaite pour vous que cela soit un signe premonitoire de votre evolution professionnelle au sein de notre maison. 5 I I Determination, discretion, disponibilite, humour, ecoute et esprit collectif, attention aux autres sont les qualites qui vous caracterisent et c'est a hon droit, comme je l'ai dit au debut demon intervention, que la Republique a reconnu vos merites. C'est pourquoi, Nathalie Aufauvre, au nom du President de la Republique, nous vous faisons Chevalier dans l'Ordre National du Merite. 6 ","christian noyer",""
"discours_2010_06_12.json","12.06.2010","Microsoft Word - CN2_Convention_6_12.docx  Intervention Christian Noyer  Nous voici réunis pour la troisième fois en convention. Sachez que j’en suis très heureux.  Je crois important que nous fassions le point chaque année sur l’évolution de notre environnement, la stratégie de la Banque et la manière dont elle se développe, jour après jour, grâce à votre mobilisation et à celle de tous vos collaborateurs. Lors de notre précédent rendez-vous, nous avions analysé les deux années de crise – crise   financière puis économique. Nous savions alors que la sortie de cette crise sans précédent serait longue et difficile.  L’année 2010 a pleinement justifié notre prudence. L’endettement massif des États a créé des fortes inquiétudes sur la capacité de la zone euro à retrouver le chemin de la croissance. La Grèce d’abord puis l’Irlande aujourd’hui, ont dû se résoudre à faire appel à l’Europe et au FMI.  Face à cette montée des risques, des solutions ont été trouvées : l’Europe a mis en place un système pérenne qui permet aux États les plus fragiles de se refinancer, l’Eurosystème a choisi de lancer un programme de rachat de titres de dette souveraine afin que ses décisions en matière de taux d’intérêt conservent tous leurs effets dans les économies de la zone euro.  Dans ce contexte tendu, la Banque de France a continué de jouer un rôle de premier plan en apportant son expertise, ses solutions, son énergie au service de l’intérêt général.  C’est pàr un bref rappel de ce qu’a représenté 2010 pour la Banque que je vais commencer . J’évoquerai ensuite le cadre rénové dans lequel s’inscrit désormais notre stratégie de moyen terme. Enfin, je détaillerai ce qui doit constituer nos priorités pour 2011.      n 2010 : une année de mobilisation Cette année 2010 a été chargée pour chacun d’entre vous.  Je m’adresse d’abord au réseau de la Banque qui se voit confier des taches toujours plus importantes et toujours plus difficile. Vous avez su, avec efficacité et rigueur, mener de front ces missions, trouver des réponses face à la montée du surendettement ou des difficultés de trésorerie des entreprises.  - D’abord, la médiation du crédit, puisque grâce à l’action des directeurs départementaux et des équipes Entreprises du réseau, 12 000 entreprises ont pu résoudre leurs difficultés de trésorerie ou de financement, et 220 000 emplois être sauvegardés.  - Ensuite, l’accompagnement des particuliers. Avec plus de 200 000 dossiers nouveaux déposés, le traitement du surendettement est resté à son plus haut niveau sans que cela n’ait d’impact sur les délais de traitement. Les dispositions de la loi Lagarde doivent maintenant être intégrées ; je ne doute pas que cela sera fait dans les meilleures conditions par les 1 500 agents du réseau impliqués dans cette mission.  - Désormais, pour les hommes politiques, pour les acteurs économiques, vous êtes le bras armé de toute action de soutien économique d’ampleur nationale. Vous êtes devenus incontournables et c’est à vos résultats que vous le devez.   2010 a été aussi l’année de la création de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, qui rassemble 900 personnes venus d’horizons divers au service de la supervision bancaire et assurantielle.. Fusionner 4 autorités n’est pas une mince affaire. Je sais tout le travail que cela a pu représenter, d’abord  pour ceux qui étaient directement concernés, mais aussi pour  ceux qui ont travaillé sur les moyens techniques apportés à la nouvelle structure : l’informatique, l’immobilier, les ressources humaines, etc. Je tiens à les remercier ici. Je sais qu’une fusion c’est aussi la confrontation de cultures et de modes de fonctionnement différents. De ce fait, apprendre à travailler ensemble n’est toujours simple. Je tiens toutefois à souligner la qualité de travail que vous avez su produire que ce soit dans les instances européennes et internationales – j’y reviendrai - comme dans le travail quotidien : missions de contrôle, mise en place de la surveillance des pratiques commerciales… j’y ajouterai une mention spéciale pour l’excellent travail qui a été fait lors de l’élaboration de Stress tests   européennes, dans des conditions souvent périlleuses. L’adossement de l’ACP à la Banque de France a pris tout son sens à cette occasion puisque ce fut un travail commun.  Enfin, 2010 a aussi été l’année d’évolutions réglementaires majeures. Les travaux conduits sous l’égide du G20 au Comité de Bâle et au Forum de stabilité financière ou au sein des autorités européennes et notamment au CEIOPS pour l’assurance, ont débouché sur des réformes essentielles pour la solidité des systèmes bancaires et financiers : les nouveaux dispositifs de surveillance micro et macro-prudentielle ont été adoptés par le Parlement européen, les nouveaux critères d’appréciation de la solvabilité des banques (Bâle 3) ont été finalisés et les travaux pour l’adoption des nouvelles normes assurancielles (Solvency 2) progressent.   n Les axes stratégiques et les principaux objectifs de la Banque   Je souhaiterais vous présenter sous la forme d’une « carte stratégique », les 4 axes stratégiques qui orientent notre action et les objectifs qui en découlent   Premier axe : Conforter notre position dans l’Eurosystème C’est une réalité depuis plusieurs années : le besoin d’une gestion efficiente des ressources de l’Eurosystème, couplé à une intégration européenne croissante, pose la question du positionnement de chacune des banques centrales nationales. Nous sommes la banque centrale de la deuxième économie de la zone euro ;nous avons fait le choix d’être une banque centrale influente, capable de peser dans les décisions de l’Eurosystème, et présente dans des réalisations concrètes. Ce premier axe se décline en 3 objectifs : 1) Accroître notre influence dans la définition et la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire : il s’agit de notre expertise en matière de valorisation du collatéral des opérations de politique monétaire qui nous permet d’assurer des valorisations pour le compte de l’Eurosystème, dans le cadre du projet CEPH.  2) Cibler des offres attractives pour l’Eurosystème : Nous l’avons déjà fait avec Target 2 et Target 2 Titres, dont nous assurons la direction de projet pour une mise en production en 2014. Aujourd’hui, nous avons une proposition conjointe avec la Banque d’Espagne, de   développer et d’héberger en tandem la plate-forme des opérations de marché MOP. Ce projet a été retenu. C’est plus qu’un succès, c’est la reconnaissance de la qualité et de la solidité de notre approche. 3) Renforcer notre positionnement opérationnel sur les marchés : Il s’agit pour nous de renforcer notre positionnement sur les marchés. Qu’est-ce qui peut l’illustrer mieux que l’ouverture en octobre dernier de notre salle des marchés à New York ? Nous avons désormais une implantation fixe sur l’une des plus grandes places financières mondiales. Nous y gérons des portefeuilles en dollars et dollars canadiens. Nous avons déjà la réputation d’être de bons connaisseurs des marchés et nous allons développer cette compétence.  Deuxième axe : Être un acteur majeur de la stabilité financière La crise financière a mis en exergue le besoin d’un rôle accru des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour assurer la stabilité d’un système financier devenu global. Avec l’ACP et son adossement à la Banque de France, nous disposons d’une architecture de supervision solide, et d’une grande visibilité sur les éventuels  risques systémiques qui pourraient peser sur les systèmes financiers. Cette année, nous avons été extrêmement présents au plan national comme au sein des grands forums internationaux et nous avons souvent su convaincre de la pertinence de nos positions. Parce que notre système bancaire a été résilient, parce que notre mode de contrôle s’est révélé efficace et performant, nous avons pu faire entendre notre voix et peser sur les décisions. Il nous faut rester une force de proposition en matière de régulation et continuer à veiller au bon équilibre entre la nécessaire sécurité des systèmes et le financement de notre économie.  Trois objectifs stratégiques sont au service de cette ambition : 1) Contribuer au renforcement de la réglementation du système financier 2) Prévenir les risques systémiques 3). Asseoir le positionnement d’une Autorité de supervision, unifiée et forte, adossée à la Banque de France      Troisième axe : Contribuer au bon fonctionnement de l’économie La médiation du crédit, les missions étendues confiées aux commissions de surendettement, la réflexion sur la mise en place d’un fichier positif des crédits aux particuliers sont autant de marques de confiance dans l’expertise de la Banque et dans sa capacité à remplir avec réactivité de nouvelles missions au service des agents économiques. Nous devons évidemment être à la hauteur de cette confiance, qui se traduit par trois objectifs : 1) Affiner notre diagnostic sur l’économie et son financement : c’est l’expertise FIBEN et la cotation des entreprises ; c’est GEODE, c’est ACSEL. Il y a donc là des convergences, des synergies, des effets d’entraînement croisés qui nous donnent une force de frappe et une crédibilité sans équivalent. 2) Améliorer la protection des consommateurs de produits d’assurance, de banques et d’épargne : ce n’est pas une mission historique des banques centrales pourtant c’est aujourd’hui au cœur de nos préoccupations. Que ce soit à travers Infobanque et la plate-forme téléphonique étendue aux produits bancaires et d’assurance ou avec le contrôle des établissements et la surveillance des produits nouveaux, nous essayons de répondre à ce besoin nouveau et nous allons encore accroitre nos compétences et notre efficacité pour une meilleure protection des particuliers. 3) Renforcer la sécurité des moyens de paiement.Prenons l’exemple du  traitement du fiduciaire. La bonne circulation des billets et des pièces est une mission historique des banques centrales, elle demeure une composante essentielle du bon fonctionnement de notre économie. Là encore notre stratégie s’appuie sur toutes nos ressources : la création de nouveaux centres fiduciaires permettant des traitements industriels et un approvisionnement en toutes circonstances ; les contrôles que nous exerçons sur les acteurs de la filière qui réalisent du recyclage ; les actions de formation et d’information grand public que nous menons, à la Cité des sciences, lors des Journées du patrimoine ou encore via les supports de communication professionnelle des 80 0000 boulangers de France…Tout cela va dans le même sens : assurer la sécurité des moyens de paiement fiduciaires. Nos contributions sur tous ces volets sont donc cruciales.      Quatrième axe : Assurer notre indépendance financière La gestion rigoureuse de nos ressources, et notamment de la rente monétaire dont nous sommes dépositaires, est le meilleur gage de notre indépendance. Parce que nous sommes rigoureux, nous pouvons financer notre développement en toute indépendance, sans avoir à nous tourner vers l’actionnaire. C’est grâce à cela que nous sommes en mesure de consolider nos fonds propres et de provisionner nos engagements en matière de retraite, tout en apportant à notre actionnaire, un confortable dividende. Nous devons poursuivre dans cette voie, en assurant la meilleure allocation possible des ressources dont nous disposons. Trois objectifs y concourent : 1) Renforcer notre structure financière 2) Optimiser nos investissements 3) Offrir le meilleur service au meilleur coût. Je soulignerai ici simplement deux points pour indiquer comment nous devons y parvenir. D’abord avec le Comité des grands projets créé cette année, nous disposons désormais d’un outil pour éclairer les choix d’investissements, mais aussi vérifier tout au long du déroulement du projet, que le cahier des charges initial est respecté. C’est essentiel, car si devons réaliser les investissements nécessaires à nos ambitions, nous devons aussi nous assurer que les sommes investies le sont à bon escient. Le deuxième aspect vise tous les niveaux de l’entreprise. Nous devons, chacun dans notre domaine, faire nos meilleurs efforts pour produire les meilleurs services au moindre coût. Réduire nos dépenses, optimiser nos ressources tout en conservant une même qualité et une même implication dans le travail, tel est notre challenge au quotidien.   Les six facteurs clés de succès Tous ces objectifs dessinent un programme ambitieux. Réussir ce programme, atteindre cette ambition reposent largement sur la mobilisation de chacun. C’est pourquoi s’ajoute à ces objectifs opérationnels, un ensemble d’actions qui visent à faire évoluer nos manières de travailler, de vivre ensemble dans l’entreprise pour rendre l’atteinte de nos objectifs collectivement plus facile, et individuellement plus gratifiante.    Ces actions s’organisent autour de 6facteurs clés : 1) Favoriser le mieux être au travail 2) Renforcer l’adéquation des ressources humaines aux priorités stratégiques 3) Développer la transversalité 4) Développer la culture de la performance et de la maîtrise des risques 5) Développer un système d’information orienté clients internes 6) Atteindre nos objectifs environnementaux Quelques mots sur chacun d’entre eux. 1) Favoriser le mieux être au travail Depuis plusieurs années, la Banque s’applique à instaurer des conditions de travail propices à l’épanouissement professionnel de chacun, gage de performance individuelle et collective. Quelques exemples les plus récents : la charte de la parentalité, par laquelle nous nous engageons à mieux prendre en compte les contraintes familiales ; le label égalité, qui valide notre action continue en matière d’égalité hommes/femmes ; ou encore l’accord d’entreprise sur le télétravail qui va déboucher sur de toutes premières expériences. J’ajouterai, bien sûr, la démarche de prévention des risques psychosociaux qui témoigne de notre volonté d’associer toutes les parties prenantes à la construction d’un meilleur vivre-ensemble. Jean-Paul Redouin y reviendra largement dans la suite de l’après-midi. Ce que je souhaite affirmer fortement tout de suite, c’est que ces différentes démarches vont se poursuivre et que les programmes d’action que nous avons arrêtés seront mis en œuvre. 2) Renforcer l’adéquation des ressources humaines aux priorités stratégiques Chacun le sait, nous allons enregistrer dans les prochaines années des départs massifs. Relever tous nos défis, atteindre nos objectifs suppose donc que nous puissions assurer dans le temps, en quantité et en qualité, l’adéquation des nos ressources humaines aux besoins issus de notre stratégie. Cela passe par trois volets : - le recrutement d’agents disposant de compétences pointues dans tous nos domaines critiques ; - la formation en continu du personnel pour qu’il puisse non pas accompagner mais porter les changements techniques, organisationnels, comportementaux de l’entreprise ;   - l’organisation des transferts de savoir afin que le capital de connaissances et de professionnalisme des agents qui partiront ne soit pas perdu. Ce sont autant de politiques déjà engagées qui vont être approfondies. 3) Développer la transversalité Le mot peut sembler galvaudé ; il renvoie pourtant à un besoin crucial. Parce que nos activités interagissent les unes avec les autres ; parce que les problèmes posés sont complexes ; parce que trouver des solutions suppose de voir large en s’appuyant sur des points de vue croisés. Et, je tiens à le souligner, nous savons travailler ensemble. Nous l’avons prouvé dans tous les grands moments, du passage à l’euro à la résolution de la crise qui fait jouer simultanément études, opérations, contrôle prudentiel, et combine étroitement action du siège et action du réseau. Mais nous sommes sans doute moins bons au quotidien, lorsqu’il s’agit de partager de manière volontaire et systématique nos informations, nos connaissances, nos compétences, ou de chercher les savoirs là où ils sont. C’est pourtant ce vers quoi nous devons tendre. Et c’est pourquoi nous devons continuer à déployer les outils et la culture qui permettront à tous de s’informer, d’échanger et de mieux travailler ensemble jour après jour. 4) Développer la culture de la performance et de la maîtrise des risques C’est grâce à elle que nous pourrons garantir la qualité de gestion qui constitue notre quatrième axe stratégique. Cette double préoccupation doit bien sûr être intégrée par chacun, à son niveau de responsabilité. La mise en place de dispositifs de pilotage, le suivi des objectifs et une meilleure reconnaissance des contributions de chacun sont autant de voies pour y parvenir. 5) Développer un système d’information orienté clients internes Compte tenu de nos activités, le système d’information constitue la colonne vertébrale de notre action. Il supporte et soutient nos actions au quotidien, tout en conditionnant l’organisation de nos processus opérationnels. Il est donc indispensable qu’il se place au plus près des domaines pour leur permettre de mener à bien leurs projets stratégiques. 6) Atteindre nos objectifs environnementaux Nous sommes désormais engagés ici dans une démarche ambitieuse, qui s’inscrit dans le cadre du Grenelle de l’environnement. Le déploiement du Schéma de réduction de l’empreinte environnementale en est la traduction au sein de l’entreprise. Celui-ci s’appuie sur   des chantiers importants, notamment pour améliorer la performance énergétique des bâtiments. Pour réussir, il doit s’appuyer aussi sur l’évolution des comportements individuels pour économiser toutes les ressources naturelles : eau, énergie, etc. Cela devrait avoir d’autant plus de sens pour chaque agent que nous avons volontairement inscrit la réduction de nos consommations d’électricité et de gaz parmi les objectifs de l’accord triennal d’intéressement. Et c’est par toutes ces actions combinées que la Banque doit devenir exemplaire en matière environnementale.    Cette carte stratégique constitue donc notre feuille de route. Elle indique clairement là où nous voulons aller ; elle constitue un point de repère compréhensible par tous ; elle doit nous permettre de retrouver le bon chemin si nous nous égarons. Et c’est bien en s’appuyant sur elle que le Comité de direction vérifiera désormais deux fois par an le degré d’atteinte de nos objectifs. Ces réunions, dites de pilotage stratégique, nous permettront de mesurer le chemin parcouru et, en cas de dérive, de trouver les solutions pour revenir au plus près de la route que nous nous étions fixée. Je voudrais enfin souligner que ce nouveau mode de pilotage et de suivi se décline dans les domaines. En partant de la carte d’ensemble, les directeurs généraux ont établi celle de leur domaine ; et c’est elle qui servira de support au suivi de la stratégie du domaine. Avec cette nouvelle organisation, nous nous donnons donc les moyens de suivre le déploiement de notre stratégie ; nous franchissons un degré supplémentaire vers une gestion exemplaire ; et nous nous assurons que la Banque sera prête pour ses défis futurs.  n Les deux priorités 2011 Réussir la présidence française du G20 Notre première priorité pour 2011 est de réussir la présidence française du G20. Depuis le début de la crise financière, le G20 est devenu le nouvel organe central de décision en matière de gouvernance du système financier. Sa « filière finance » fait travailler de manière conjointe les ministres des finances et les gouverneurs de banques centrales. C’est là qu’ont été   débattues, avant leur mise en application par les régulateurs, les nouvelles règles de rémunération des opérateurs de marché, l’isolement des paradis fiscaux ou l’esquisse des nouvelles règles prudentielles dites de Bâle 3. Aujourd’hui nous travaillons principalement sur deux grands projets: le premier que nous appelons le « Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth » est un projet ambitieux qui vise à la coordination de  nos politiques économiques et le second a pour objectif une réforme le système monétaire international.  La présidence française du G20, qui a débuté il y a moins d’un mois, nous offre ainsi une opportunité unique pour guider les choix des thèmes de discussion et être force de proposition. En coordination avec les services de l’Élysée et du ministère des Finances, nous allons donc tout faire pour que les réformes se poursuivent afin de renforcer la résilience du système financier international. Notre responsabilité est donc historique. Jean-Pierre Landau y reviendra en détail tout à l’heure.  2e priorité : poursuivre la transformation de la Banque Au cours des années passées, notre institution a fait la preuve de sa capacité à se transformer pour répondre au mieux à l’évolution de son environnement et préparer son avenir. Nous devons poursuivre en ce sens, c'est-à-dire ajuster en permanence nos modes d’organisation, nos fonctionnements, nos outils, pour les rendre plus performants et accroitre la valeur ajoutée que nous délivrons à notre environnement. Ce souci d’efficacité et de rigueur, et singulièrement de rigueur budgétaire, n’est pas conjoncturel. C’est une exigence permanente. Mais la crise et l’effort général de la puissance publique pour maîtriser les déficits les rendent plus cruciaux encore : 2011 sera donc tout particulièrement placé sous le signe de la rigueur de gestion. Toutefois, rigueur ne veut pas dire renoncement. La Banque consent toujours aux investissements de long terme nécessaires. En 2010, plusieurs décisions d’investissement, pour des montants significatifs, ont été prises (exemples). En 2011, priorité sera donnée à la mise en œuvre de ces décisions (préciser). Un effort particulier sera donc porté sur le suivi et le pilotage des actions engagées.  n Conclusion    Médiation du crédit, organisation du G20, information du public via Internet ou téléphone, développement de T2S, réformes internes, ouverture d’une salle de marché ou changements d’outils applicatifs : quelque soit le domaine de compétence, quelque soit le public auquel elle s’adresse, la Banque est une institution en mouvement, en phase avec son temps. Notre capacité à réagir au plus fort de la crise est la meilleure preuve que nous ayons pu offrir de notre utilité au service de nos concitoyens. Nos contributions sur le plan français, européen ou international sont reconnues. C’est un motif de fierté dont nous pouvons tous nous enorgueillir. Cette réussite est celle de tous les agents, au premier rang desquels les managers que vous êtes. Je tiens à vous en remercier très chaleureusement. Et je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour poursuivre ce travail en profondeur et dans la durée. Je sais de la même manière pouvoir compter sur notre nouveau comité de direction. Vous le savez, c’est une équipe à la fois expérimentée et renouvelée qui assure désormais le pilotage opérationnel de notre action. Et c’est important, car aussi bien tracés soient nos missions fondamentales et nos axes stratégiques, ils doivent s’incarner dans des hommes et des femmes, qui les déclinent, les fassent vivre et leur donnent sens. Communiquer, expliquer, rattacher chaque élément du quotidien à notre carte stratégique, c’est en effet votre responsabilité vis-à-vis de l’entreprise et de vos agents. Je vous demande donc de relayer mon message auprès de vos collaborateurs, de faire preuve de la pédagogie nécessaire pour que nos priorités soient comprises et partagées, et de favoriser la mobilisation, l’implication et la reconnaissance du travail de chacun. Je vous remercie par avance. Car c’est la garantie de notre succès collectif ; et c’est l’assurance du bien-être au travail de chacun.  ","christian noyer",""
"discours_2014_04_11.json","11.04.2014","1    Conférence de l’ACPR sur le contrôle des pratiques  commerciales des acteurs financiers  Mardi 4 novembre 2014  Discours de Christian Noyer Gouverneur de la Banque de France et Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution   Mesdames, Messieurs,  Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour cette nouvelle conférence de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, et vous remercie de votre présence. Cette journée du 4 novembre 2014, qui marque par ailleurs la mise en place du Mécanisme de supervision unique (MSU) des banques de la zone euro, est pour moi une excellente occasion d’approfondir nos échanges sur des missions qui continuent de relever intégralement de l’ACPR, comme le contrôle des pratiques commerciales en assurance et en banque, thème de la matinée, et les services de paiement et de monnaie électronique, thème de l’après-midi. La protection de la clientèle et le contrôle des pratiques commerciales des acteurs financiers sont désormais devenus des sujets incontournables, aux plans national, européen et international. Permettez-moi de m’y attarder un peu. Les réflexions aux niveaux mondial et européen auront un impact très concret sur la réglementation nationale dans les années à venir, et par là-même sur l’ACPR. Le prochain sommet du G20 devrait présenter les travaux finalisés de l’OCDE sur les 10 principes de protection des consommateurs de produits financiers qui ont vocation à être 2  introduits dans les règlementations des États-membres. Ces principes déclinent la notion de comportement responsable des professionnels et de leurs intermédiaires.  Au niveau européen, les règlementations sont en train de modifier sensiblement le paysage normatif bancaire et assurantiel français traditionnel. Ces changements se feront d’autant plus rapidement qu’ils s’accompagnent d’une évolution notable du mode de production des normes européennes, avec une montée en puissance des actes délégués et des lignes directrices édictés directement par les Autorités européennes de supervision. Ces règlementations et lignes directrices sur la commercialisation sont de plus en plus souvent d’application trans-sectorielle, avec un objectif d’harmonisation des obligations entre les secteurs de la banque, de l’assurance et des instruments financiers. Issus de la directive MIF relative aux marchés des instruments financiers, de nombreux concepts comme la gestion des conflits d’intérêt, l’obligation d’agir au mieux des intérêts du client ou la transparence des rémunérations des distributeurs, servent de référence pour les discussions en cours sur la distribution des produits d’assurance et du crédit.  Ces réglementations et lignes directrices tendent à objectiver les exigences mises à la charge des professionnels : quel contenu pour l’information précontractuelle ? Quelle matérialisation du conseil ? Comment s’assurer de la solvabilité d’un emprunteur, à partir de quels éléments ? Qu’est-ce qu’un conflit d’intérêt et comment le gérer en pratique ? Les réponses apportées à ces questions ont toutes une incidence directe sur l’organisation des établissements et de leurs intermédiaires. Je voudrais illustrer mon propos en évoquant trois thèmes communs aux 3 secteurs liés à l’environnement de la vente et actuellement traités dans différents groupes de travail européens : le conseil, la rémunération des conseillers et le processus de mise sur le marché des produits financiers. Ces trois sujets représentent une opportunité de faire évoluer les pratiques vers une meilleure protection des clients. Il s’agit, d’une part, d’éviter des situations structurelles de conflit d’intérêts entre un conseiller et un client. Il s’agit , d’autre part, d’accompagner l’innovation financière afin qu’elle réponde aux attentes des clients sans leur être préjudiciable. En matière de conseil, la tendance européenne est de distinguer un service de conseil autonome de l’acte de vente lui-même, et payé en tant que tel par le client. Ce schéma, très éloigné de la conception française en banque et en assurance, pourrait présenter une régression dans le domaine de la protection de la clientèle. L’ACPR, favorable au maintien du conseil intégré à la vente, veille à maintenir un socle d’exigences non-détachables du produit lui-même afin d’éviter la généralisation de ventes non conseillées.  3  En ce qui concerne la rémunération, les marchés financiers se sont dotés les premiers d’un dispositif encadrant les politiques et les pratiques de rémunération. Ce dispositif traite à la fois de la rémunération des collaborateurs salariés en relation avec la clientèle et du commissionnement des intermédiaires. Le secteur de la banque et de l’assurance suit désormais cette tendance. La rémunération est un élément important qui ne doit pas remettre en cause la neutralité du conseil donné. Si un encadrement semble nécessaire, ne serait-ce que pour écarter les situations de conflit d’intérêt, il ne doit toutefois pas avoir pour effet de créer des arbitrages artificiels entre les différents modes de distribution. En matière de décision de mise sur le marché d’un produit financier, la notion de gouvernance des produits est relativement nouvelle sur la scène européenne. Elle vise à mettre en place, en amont de la commercialisation des produits, des dispositifs de protection de la clientèle qui reposent sur les producteurs. Encadrer la « gouvernance du produit » vise à responsabiliser davantage les producteurs vis-à-vis des clients sur les produits qu’ils lancent sur le marché. Plus particulièrement, il s’agit de réserver à une clientèle préalablement ciblée les produits considérés. C’est la réponse européenne à la vente non conseillée. Ce nouveau dispositif ne doit toutefois pas être construit en opposition au conseil. Une articulation intelligente peut être organisée entre les deux approches, l’une comme l’autre protectrice de la clientèle, afin de les rendre complémentaires.  Ces trois sujets attestent du progrès rapide des réflexions européennes en matière de protection de la clientèle et constitueront bientôt un nouveau défi pour l’ACPR qui devra faire appliquer tous ces nouveaux concepts. Un autre défi pour l’ACPR proviendra des nouveaux canaux et modes de distribution dans le secteur financier. Là aussi, le paysage évolue. Principalement en raison de nouveaux modes de « consommation » au sens large et de l'application généralisée des nouvelles technologies à la vie quotidienne. L'ACPR le constate déjà dans ses contrôles : les canaux de commercialisation se multiplient en termes d’acteurs, qu’ils soient intermédiaires en assurance ou en banque, courtiers, grossistes ou mandataires, plateformes, comparateurs, sans oublier les multiples acteurs de l'industrie des paiements.  La récente ordonnance du 30 mai 2014 relative au financement participatif a ainsi introduit de nouveaux acteurs habilités à financer des projets sous certaines conditions, par exception 4  au monopole bancaire, via des plateformes de prêts ou de dons, avec le nouveau statut des intermédiaires en financement participatif.  Ces différents acteurs modifient ou modifieront le marché : quels en seront les enjeux commerciaux ? Et avec quelle responsabilité vis-à-vis des clients ? Pour quelle articulation entre ces nouveaux distributeurs, et avec les producteurs ?  Ces canaux se modifient aussi au plan technique : la banque numérique, la vente à distance, les nouvelles modalités de paiement, et plus généralement l'usage des données des clients dans l'univers de l'intelligence artificielle et ses applications multiples pour proposer des solutions aux clients.  Ces évolutions doivent intégrer – et non remettre en question – le principe sur lequel est bâtie la réglementation européenne, celui d’une relation singulière entre un professionnel du secteur financier et un client – en principe moins technicien, moins informé. C’est là le second défi de l’ACPR : veiller à ce que ces nouveaux canaux et modalités de distribution respectent les règles de protection de la clientèle. Dans cet environnement en évolution permanente, l’ACPR dispose d’une panoplie complète d’instruments pour remplir sa mission de protection de la clientèle. Depuis sa mise en place en mars 2010, l’ACPR a développé des méthodologies de contrôle des pratiques commerciales et des moyens conséquents pour assurer sa mission de protection de la clientèle des établissements bancaires, des organismes d’assurance et des intermédiaires financiers. En premier lieu, les contrôles sur pièces et sur place sont destinés à vérifier la conformité et le respect des règles applicables, et à faire corriger les erreurs avant qu'elles n'aient des conséquences dommageables pour les clients.  Face à des manquements graves aux obligations légales et réglementaires et aux conséquences significatives pour les clients, des sanctions peuvent être prononcées. Cette approche répressive est légitime ; elle est nécessaire pour sanctionner les manquements passés. Et la Commission des sanctions de l’ACPR ne manque pas, quand il le faut, de sanctionner. Elle l’a d’ailleurs fait récemment lorsqu’elle a constaté une application défaillante des modalités du droit au compte, élément substantiel de l’inclusion bancaire de clientèles fragiles sur lequel les établissements se sont fortement engagés. Elle l’a fait également lorsqu’elle a constaté que les exigences désormais anciennes du devoir de conseil en assurance n’étaient toujours pas respectées. Elle l’a fait enfin, tout récemment, en assurance-vie, lorsqu’elle a constaté que le dispositif d’identification des assurés décédés, 5  de recherche des bénéficiaires et de paiement des capitaux aux clients assurés ou bénéficiaires n’était pas correctement mis en œuvre.  Si les sanctions sont aussi utiles pour leur valeur d’exemple, elles ne doivent pas éclipser l’ensemble des autres outils et instruments, davantage tournés vers la prévention, dont dispose l’ACPR. S’agissant du droit souple, le pouvoir d’émettre des recommandations a été expressément conféré à l’ACPR par le législateur pour tirer parti de l'observation des bonnes et mauvaises pratiques et ainsi orienter le marché. À visée très opérationnelle, les recommandations de l’ACPR aident la profession à identifier et prendre en compte de manière plus concrète ce qui est attendu dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de la règlementation protectrice de la clientèle. Ayant pour objet de modifier ou d’orienter les comportements des professionnels, elles forment un instrument préventif très utile et complémentaire à l’approche répressive. Enfin, la communication, la pédagogie, le dialogue, notamment avec les professionnels, constituent un élément déterminant de la politique de supervision auquel l’ACPR est très attachée – et la présente conférence en est l'un des moments forts.  Je profite justement de cette conférence pour rappeler la vigilance particulière de l’ACPR sur le niveau des taux de revalorisation qui seront servis aux assurés au titre de 2014. Les taux d’intérêt sur les marchés obligataires, sur lesquels les assureurs sont très largement présents, suivent une tendance baissière depuis plusieurs années et cet environnement de taux bas pourrait se maintenir pendant encore de nombreuses années. Les assureurs doivent s’adapter au contexte actuel en s’appuyant sur un rendement adapté des contrats d’assurance. Cela peut notamment passer par un lissage dans le temps de la distribution des résultats aux assurés, en dotant la provision pour participation aux bénéfices à un niveau suffisamment élevé. Par le passé, une bonne gestion des taux de revalorisation et des provisions a permis aux assureurs français de traverser plusieurs crises bien mieux que d’autres. Mettre en question la sécurité du marché, en prenant des décisions imprudentes de revalorisation au détriment des réserves, diminuerait la capacité de résilience de certains acteurs en cas de crise. C’est pourquoi l’ensemble des acteurs du marché de l’assurance concernés doit pratiquer une revalorisation des contrats adaptée tant à la performance réelle de leurs actifs qu’aux caractéristiques de leurs engagements au passif.  Je laisse maintenant la parole à Fabrice Pesin et aux équipes de l’ACPR pour revenir sur certains des aspects que j’ai brièvement évoqués et vous souhaite une excellente conférence.

"discours_2014_10_22.json","22.10.2014"," 1  « Vers des paiements de détail 2.0 : les nouveaux défis pour la sécurité » Paris, le 22 octobre 2014 Discours d’ouverture de Christian Noyer Gouverneur de la Banque de France Mesdames, Messieurs, C’est pour moi un grand plaisir d’inaugurer aujourd’hui cette conférence consacrée aux travaux du forum SecuRe Pay et aux nouveaux défis en matière de sécurité qui devront être relevés pour les paiements de détail. Au nom de la Banque centrale européenne et de la Banque de France, je vous souhaite à tous la bienvenue à Paris et je vous remercie d’avoir accepté notre invitation à participer à cet événement. Toutes les autorités ayant un intérêt dans le domaine de la sécurité au plan national et européen sont représentées aujourd’hui, ainsi que les principaux acteurs du secteur privé. Je suis convaincu que cela va susciter des débats fructueux et fournir une vue d’ensemble exhaustive des principaux défis et problématiques concernant la sécurité des moyens de paiement de détail.  L’organisation de cette conférence ici à Paris illustre l’appui ininterrompu que la Banque de France a apporté au forum SecuRe Pay depuis le tout début, afin de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail en Europe.  Ce soutien trouve son origine dans la mission de la Banque de France qui, depuis 2001, nous impose explicitement de garantir la sécurité des paiements scripturaux. Cela a contribué à nourrir une longue expérience dans le traitement des questions de sécurité et d’efficience, ainsi que des arbitrages du point de vue des politiques publiques, expérience à laquelle je voudrais me référer afin de tirer quelques enseignements susceptibles de retenir votre attention dans le cadre des débats auxquels vous allez participer aujourd’hui.  2  Au cours des dix dernières années, le secteur financier a connu une profonde mutation avec l’apparition d’internet et l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information. C’est particulièrement vrai en ce qui concerne les moyens de paiement. L’introduction des cartes à puce dotées d’un code confidentiel en France au début des années quatre-vingt-dix, puis partout en Europe ces dernières années, constitue un excellent exemple de la manière dont l’innovation peut être la source d’avantages en termes d’efficacité mais aussi de sécurité pour la chaîne de paiement. Cette introduction a effectivement contribué à rendre très sûrs les paiements par carte au point de vente.  Toutefois, les innovations se sont également accompagnées de nouveaux défis en termes de gestion des risques. C’est notamment le cas avec le développement des paiements à distance qui peuvent être effectués sur internet. Comme le souligne le rapport sur la fraude relative aux paiements par carte publié par la BCE en février 2014, la fraude résultant des paiements à distance, principalement sur internet, a augmenté de près de 21 % en 2012 dans l’espace SEPA, et représentait 60 % de l’ensemble des pertes dues à des fraudes avec des cartes mises en circulation dans l’espace SEPA.  Heureusement, les vulnérabilités à l’origine de ces fraudes sont bien identifiées et des efforts importants ont été entrepris tant par les autorités publiques que par le secteur privé pour y remédier. En France, une contribution importante est apportée par l’Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de paiement, que j’ai l’honneur de présider. Ses recommandations ont favorisé la reconnaissance par les parties prenantes, qui sont toutes représentées à l’Observatoire, de l’importance d’une authentification rigoureuse du client pour les paiements sur internet et ont facilité sa large adoption. Il a nettement contribué à limiter l’incidence sur les taux de fraude, au moins pour les paiements nationaux, et a favorisé la spectaculaire expansion du commerce électronique à laquelle nous assistons actuellement.  Mais au-delà du développement des paiements par carte sur internet, d’autres innovations comme les paiements sans contact et par téléphone mobile ou les services de banque en ligne soulèvent aussi des questions importantes. Parmi ces questions figure notamment la protection des données de paiement sensibles. Pour y répondre, la Banque de France a travaillé avec la communauté bancaire, ce qui a abouti à la conclusion d’un accord en 2011 afin de promouvoir la protection des identifiants de comptes bancaires et des numéros de cartes. La question de la protection des données sensibles apparaît d’autant plus importante que nous observons l’arrivée de nouveaux acteurs dans la chaîne de paiement, comme les tiers fournisseurs de services de paiement, susceptibles d’apporter une contribution positive stimulant l’innovation et la concurrence potentielle sur le marché des paiements de détail, mais dont le mode de fonctionnement ne doit pas abaisser le niveau de sécurité actuel des services de banque en ligne.   3 Quelles leçons pouvons-nous tirer de cette expérience afin de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail à plus grande échelle ? J’aimerais souligner trois de ces enseignements, qui pourraient présenter un intérêt pour le débat d’aujourd’hui : Premièrement, l’adoption par les consommateurs de solutions de paiement innovantes sera d’autant plus large et durable que ces solutions seront sûres et il est dans l’intérêt des innovateurs d’accorder suffisamment d’attention aux questions de sécurité. Deuxièmement, le dialogue et la coopération entre les différents acteurs en matière de sécurité des paiements sont indispensables pour obtenir des résultats robustes. Des forums tels que l’Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de paiement en France, qui regroupe des commerçants, des consommateurs, des acteurs du secteur bancaire et du marché des paiements, mais aussi des représentants du Parlement français et d’autres autorités publiques compétentes, peuvent se révéler très utiles de ce point de vue. Dans ce type de forums, les autorités ont à jouer un rôle important de catalyseur pour faciliter le consensus entre les intervenants, surmonter les problèmes techniques et adopter des exigences garantissant le plus haut niveau de sécurité des paiements de détail, tout en encourageant l’innovation et l’efficience. Enfin, la coopération et la coordination entre les autorités publiques exerçant des responsabilités dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements doivent intégrer une dimension européenne et internationale pour être pleinement efficaces. C’est une conséquence directe de l’interdépendance des questions de sécurité au plan européen et même mondial. Je me réjouis de constater qu’au niveau européen, la création du forum Secure Pay, en 2011, a suivi cette voie en renforçant la coopération entre les banques centrales et les autorités prudentielles de l’Union européenne et de l’Espace économique européen dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail. Cette coopération au sein de Secure Pay a déjà donné d’importants résultats : deux ensembles de recommandations ont été émis jusqu’à présent, concernant la sécurité des paiements sur internet en 2013, avec une mise en œuvre par le marché prévue avant février 2015, et la sécurité des paiements par téléphone mobile en 2014, pour laquelle les recommandations sont en cours de finalisation. Le texte définitif des recommandations relatives à la sécurité des services d’accès aux comptes de paiement a également été publié, à titre d’information, en mai 2014, en étroite collaboration avec l’Autorité Bancaire Européenne (ABE), à la lumière de la révision en cours de la directive sur les services de paiement. La prise en compte par le législateur européen d’une grande partie des recommandations émises par le forum Secure Pay pour la révision de la directive sur les services de paiement constitue, à mon sens, une preuve de la qualité des travaux menés par le forum. Je salue en particulier l’intégration d’une authentification rigoureuse du client dans le texte révisé de la directive, ce qui constitue clairement un progrès  majeur en matière de sécurité des paiements de détail. Secure Pay a récemment connu un profond changement de gouvernance et sera à l’avenir présidé conjointement par l’Autorité bancaire européenne et la Banque centrale européenne. Cette évolution  4 devrait encore renforcer la coopération entre les institutions de surveillance et de supervision et faciliter la mise en œuvre des recommandations. En conclusion - et je m’arrêterai là – je souhaiterais souligner combien cette conférence est en prise avec l’actualité. La proposition de directive révisée sur les services de paiement étant actuellement examinée par le Conseil de l’Union européenne, une opportunité unique est aujourd’hui donnée à tous les acteurs de s’attaquer aux différentes questions soulevées par la nouvelle réglementation en présence de représentants de l’ensemble des autorités européennes compétentes impliquées. Encore une fois, je vous remercie tous de votre présence et je vous souhaite des discussions fructueuses et animées sur l’ensemble de ces aspects, dans l’espoir que cette conférence vous donnera une vision complète des nouveaux défis que soulève la sécurité des paiements de détail. Avant de céder la parole à notre premier groupe d’experts, je vous invite à écouter Benoît Cœuré, membre du Directoire de la Banque centrale européenne, qui ne peut être présent physiquement avec nous aujourd’hui, mais qui a enregistré ses commentaires pour nous. Je vous remercie de votre attention. ","christian noyer",""
"discours_2014_11_25.json","25.11.2014"," 1   Forum financier Paris Europlace  Tokyo, 25 novembre 2014  Le pouvoir de la politique monétaire Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  Il y a deux semaines, j’ai eu le privilège de présider à Paris le symposium triennal de la Banque de France. Le gouverneur Kuroda nous a fait le grand honneur d’y participer. Lors de ce symposium, l’un des intervenants a déclaré que, durant la crise financière, les banques centrales de la plupart des pays avaient été (je cite) le seul acteur possible ou, comme le disent les Anglais,« the only game in town » (fin de citation). Et il s’est demandé si tel serait toujours le cas dans le futur. Cette observation résume l’essence même des remarques que je formulerai aujourd’hui. Je souhaiterais parler du pouvoir de la politique monétaire dans le contexte actuel de faible inflation.   Les banques centrales ont répondu à la plus grande crise financière des soixante-dix dernières années par une action puissante et décisive. Et elles ont réussi à éviter une récession prolongée ainsi que l’effondrement de notre système financier. Aujourd’hui, toutefois, le défi auquel elles sont confrontées est différent. La croissance a été décevante dans de nombreuses parties du monde, et les prévisions ont été constamment revues à la baisse. Plus préoccupant encore pour les banques centrales, l’inflation s’est maintenue de façon persistante en deçà de notre définition de la stabilité des prix. Dans la zone euro, elle est passée, en rythme annuel, de 2,5% en 2012 à 0,3% en septembre dernier. Ce recul de l’inflation s’est produit en dépit des conditions monétaires les plus accommodantes jamais observées en Europe. On peut donc se demander si la politique monétaire aura autant de succès dans l’après-crise que durant la crise, et si elle réussira à éviter les dangers d’une inflation durablement faible.   Je centrerai mes remarques sur la zone euro, en profitant de l’organisation du forum à Tokyo pour tirer quelques leçons de l’expérience japonaise et surtout, devrais-je dire en saluant la présence du vice-gouverneur, M. Nakaso, de la grande expertise de la Banque du Japon.   2  On peut douter du pouvoir de la politique monétaire et ce, pour deux raisons. Le mécanisme de transmission peut être perturbé, et le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre peut être si bas (voire négatif) qu’il devient impossible à atteindre.   Le premier point parle de lui–même. La zone euro a souffert d’une très forte segmentation et d’un grave dysfonctionnement de ses marchés monétaire et du crédit, auquel il a été remédié de manière agressive, à l’aide d’un ensemble de mesures que je présenterai en détail dans quelques instants. Les résultats ont été significatifs. Les soldes Target 2 ont été réduits de moitié, ce qui signifie que les banques de la zone euro ne recourent plus dans la même mesure au réseau de banques centrales pour l’intermédiation de leurs opérations. Nous avons à présent achevé avec succès et crédibilité notre premier examen de la qualité des actifs au sein de notre système bancaire, et le nouveau Mécanisme de surveillance unique est devenu opérationnel la semaine dernière. Ces mesures seront essentielles pour rétablir le bon fonctionnement du canal du crédit et éliminer les différences qui subsistent au sein de la zone euro du point de vue des conditions financières.   J’en arrive à présent au second point : le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre et son importance pour la politique monétaire.   Ce concept est bien connu des économistes depuis le grand Knut Wicksell. Le taux d’intérêt « naturel » ou d’équilibre est exprimé en termes réels. C’est le taux auquel épargne et investissement s’équilibrent en situation de plein emploi et de stabilité des prix. Il constitue une référence centrale pour évaluer l’orientation monétaire. Par exemple, si le taux du marché est supérieur au taux d’équilibre, cela correspond à un excès d’épargne et à une insuffisance de la consommation et de l’investissement. En conséquence, l’inflation diminue.   Le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre n’est pas stable. Il a nettement baissé depuis le début de la crise financière, devenant peut–être négatif. Pour maintenir la stabilité des prix et éviter une inflation durablement faible, il faut que les taux du marché diminuent également. En temps normal, cela peut être réalisé en abaissant le taux directeur, ce qui se répercute sur la courbe des rendements. Toutefois, lorsque les taux directeurs atteignent ce qu’on appelle la borne zéro, cette approche « conventionnelle » de la politique monétaire n’est plus une option. Pour éviter un resserrement involontaire de la politique monétaire, les banques centrales doivent recourir à des mesures non conventionnelles. Comme je vous l’exposerai dans un instant, une large gamme d’instruments non conventionnels a été mise en œuvre dans la zone euro.   3  Le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt d’équilibre peut être temporaire ou permanent. À vrai dire, nous n’avons aucune certitude à cet égard. Nous savons cependant qu’un très faible niveau d’inflation, si on le laisse persister, ne peut qu’aggraver la situation, car, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, une faible inflation accroît le taux d’intérêt réel. À leur tour, des taux d’intérêt réels élevés ont tendance à freiner l’activité économique et à faire baisser l’inflation encore davantage. C’est le type de spirale susceptible de mener à la déflation que la politique monétaire doit chercher à contrôler et à éviter.  Ce processus peut même s’auto-entretenir encore davantage s’il exerce une incidence négative sur les anticipations d’inflation. Au cours des derniers mois, les anticipations d’inflation dans la zone euro se sont réduites à 1,2% à un horizon d’un an et à 1,5% à un horizon de deux ans. Plus inquiétant, les anticipations à long terme – jusqu’à présent extrêmement bien ancrées autour de 2% – sont orientées à la baisse. Les marchés tablent actuellement sur un taux d’inflation de 1,8% en moyenne entre 2019 et 2024 dans la zone euro.   La politique monétaire doit donc chercher à influencer à la fois les taux d’intérêt nominaux et les anticipations d’inflation. C’est exactement ce que nous faisons actuellement dans l’Eurosystème, et je vais expliquer comment.  Considérons tout d’abord les taux d’intérêt nominaux.   Les taux directeurs sont aujourd’hui proches de zéro. Des taux d’intérêt négatifs sont appliqués à la facilité de dépôt. Nous avons eu recours à des indications prospectives (forward guidance) pour annoncer que les taux resteront à ces niveaux sur une très longue période. Une nouvelle facilité de liquidité, les opérations de refinancement à plus long terme ciblées (TLTRO), a été créée, avec une échéance de quatre ans et, pour la première fois, un taux fixe garanti. En substance, les banques peuvent obtenir un financement d’une durée de quatre ans à un taux d’intérêt fixe de 0,15%. Plus récemment, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a adopté un programme d’achat d’actifs privés, couvrant à la fois des obligations sécurisées et des titres adossés à des actifs (ABS). Ces acquisitions auront deux effets positifs sur les taux d’intérêt et le crédit : elles vont encore assouplir les conditions de financement des banques ; et elles vont faire baisser les primes de risque sur les actifs privés.  Ces mesures ont été extrêmement efficaces. Notre taux interbancaire au jour le jour, l’Eonia, s’est durablement installé en territoire négatif. La courbe des rendements s’est déplacée vers le bas, tant sur la  4 partie courte que sur la partie longue. Les écarts de rendement des emprunts souverains ont baissé : le taux de la dette émise aujourd’hui par l’Espagne est inférieur à celui de la dette émise par les États–Unis. Les anticipations relatives au taux au jour le jour futur (le taux OIS) ont un profil plat et sont proches de zéro pour les trois années à venir.   Ainsi, notre action sur les taux d’intérêt nominaux a été forte et efficace. Qu’en est-il des anticipations d’inflation ?  Il serait très dangereux, dans la situation actuelle, que la banque centrale soit perçue comme plus tolérante envers une inflation faible qu’à l’égard d’une inflation trop élevée. Une telle approche asymétrique de la stabilité des prix « validerait » les anticipations de baisse de l’inflation. Et l’économie s’installerait durablement dans un équilibre d’inflation faible où tout choc négatif la ferait basculer dans la déflation pure et simple.  Afin de nous prémunir contre une telle interprétation erronée, notre Conseil des gouverneurs a affirmé unanimement son engagement à recourir à des instruments non conventionnels supplémentaires dans le cadre de son mandat, s’il devenait nécessaire de lutter contre une inflation durablement faible.   L’Eurosystème a également commencé à communiquer sur la taille de son bilan, sujet qui a suscité beaucoup d’intérêt récemment. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a indiqué qu’il s’attendait à présent à ce que ce bilan retrouve les dimensions qu’il affichait au début de l’année 2012, soit une augmentation de 1 000 milliards d'euros environ. La question de savoir si la taille du bilan d’une banque centrale est un paramètre pertinent et, surtout, si elle a une incidence sur les anticipations d’inflation, fait l’objet de nombreux débats parmi les économistes et les acteurs de marché. Permettez-moi de vous donner mon point de vue sur ce sujet.  La déclaration du Conseil des gouverneurs n’est pas formulée comme un engagement ferme mais comme une prévision. Elle est néanmoins très significative. Il est certain qu'elle doit être considérée comme une indication claire que si de nouvelles mesures doivent être prises à l’avenir, elles ne seront pas entravées par une restriction ou une limite quantitative globale. C’est d’autant plus important que le bilan de l’Eurosystème va augmenter alors que ceux des autres banques centrales sont amenés à se contracter. La communication sur la taille du bilan donne un signal très concret et des informations quant à l’orientation future de la politique monétaire. Dès lors, elle ne peut que contribuer à ramener les anticipations à des niveaux plus conformes à notre définition de la stabilité des prix.   5  Je terminerai par deux remarques sur le lien entre la politique monétaire et les autres politiques.  Premièrement, lorsque l’inflation est faible, le fait que les salaires nominaux soient rigides ou flexibles a son importance. Le Japon bénéficie d’une grande flexibilité des salaires, une situation qui est favorable à la compétitivité mais qui peut accroître la vulnérabilité de l’économie aux pressions déflationnistes. En revanche, en Europe, et en particulier en France, les salaires nominaux sont relativement rigides et continuent d’enregistrer, même dans le contexte actuel, une croissance soutenue, de 1,1 % en rythme annuel. Même si cela peut avoir une incidence négative sur les bénéfices et la compétitivité, cela constitue actuellement un amortisseur et une protection contre un risque de déflation.  Deuxièmement – s’agissant de la politique budgétaire – si, comme l’a dit Milton Friedman dans sa célèbre phrase, « l’inflation est partout et toujours un phénomène monétaire », les banques centrales devraient être à même de la contrôler quelles que soient les circonstances. Je crois que cela est fondamentalement vrai. L’expérience récente a montré, toutefois, que la politique monétaire est plus efficace lorsqu'elle est mise en œuvre dans un environnement favorable, notamment s’agissant de la politique budgétaire. Cela est souvent présenté comme un argument en faveur d’une « coopération » entre les autorités budgétaires et monétaires. Je ne suis pas totalement d’accord avec ce concept, dans la mesure où je ne vois pas comment il peut être compatible avec l’indépendance de la banque centrale. Toutefois, il ne fait aucun doute que les politiques budgétaires et monétaires interagissent, de façon plus ou moins harmonieuse. Après la crise, des inquiétudes ont été exprimées quant au risque de « prépondérance budgétaire », les banques centrales s’étant engagées dans des achats d’obligations d’État de grande ampleur.  Le problème est différent dans le contexte actuel de faible inflation. En fonction de la manière dont elles sont conduites, les politiques budgétaires peuvent soit accroître, soit réduire l'incertitude économique globale. Une plus grande incertitude signifie davantage d'épargne et même des taux d'intérêt d’équilibre plus bas. Par le biais de ce canal, les politiques budgétaires ont la capacité de compliquer la conduite des politiques monétaires ou, au contraire, de la faciliter.  Ce constat se vérifie tout particulièrement dans la zone euro, où la politique monétaire unique interagit avec dix-huit (bientôt dix-neuf) politiques budgétaires nationales. Des règles d’encadrement sont en place afin de réduire l'incertitude liée à cette interaction. Le fait qu’elles seront, ou non, correctement mises en application sera déterminant pour notre capacité à revenir rapidement à une situation de stabilité des prix selon notre définition.

DISCOURS DE M. JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET
Gouverneur de la Banque de France
 L’EURO ET L’UNION MONETAIRE
(discours traduit)
Society of Business Economists Annual Dinner
LONDRES
 12 Février 2002
- 2 -
Mesdames et Messieurs, c’est un grand plaisir et un honneur pour moi d’être
parmi vous aujourd’hui et de m’adresser à un auditoire aussi distingué. Je suis
particulièrement heureux de vous faire part de mes vues sur l’euro et sur ses
perspectives après le lancement réussi des billets et des pièces le 1er
janvier 2002.
Après avoir souligné le lancement réussi de l’Union monétaire et de l’euro,
j’examinerai le processus d’intégration économique et financière actuellement
en vigueur en Europe, et je terminerai sur les défis que doit relever la zone euro.
L’EURO EST CONSTRUIT SUR DES FONDEMENTS
SOLIDES
L’ARCHITECTURE DE L'EUROSYSTÈME
La politique monétaire unique est formulée et mise en œuvre au sein d’un cadre
institutionnel solide, l'Eurosystème, qui comprend la Banque centrale
européenne et les douze banques centrales nationales de la zone euro.
L'Eurosystème s’articule autour de trois principes : indépendance, transparence
et décentralisation.
L’indépendance de la Banque centrale européenne et des banques centrales
nationales est garantie par le Traité. Dans l’exercice de leurs pouvoirs et dans
l’accomplissement de leurs missions, ni les banques centrales de l'Eurosystème
ni un membre quelconque de ses organes de décision ne doivent solliciter ou
accepter des instructions des institutions communautaires, d’un gouvernement
d’un État membre ou de tout autre organisme. Le concept d’indépendance
recouvre l’indépendance institutionnelle, opérationnelle et financière. Nous
- 3 -
considérons que ce concept global est une contribution essentielle à la clarté et à
la crédibilité de la politique monétaire unique.
Transparence et communication : les élus, les principaux acteurs économiques
ainsi que les citoyens doivent être pleinement informés de la conduite de la
politique monétaire unique. Au niveau européen, la BCE entretient un dialogue
permanent avec le Conseil et le Parlement européens, comme le font les banques
centrales nationales avec les institutions de leur pays. La BCE a été sans doute la
première banque centrale au monde à introduire, le 1er janvier 1999, le concept
de communication régulière, fréquente et en temps réel dans le domaine de la
politique monétaire. Concrètement, une fois par mois, le président de la BCE
tient une conférence de presse à l’issue de la réunion du Conseil des
gouverneurs.
L’indépendance d’une banque centrale et sa responsabilité démocratique sont les
deux côtés d’une même médaille. À cet égard, les discours et déclarations
prononcés en public par le président de la Banque centrale européenne et par les
gouverneurs des banques centrales nationales à l’intention des institutions, mais
aussi de l’opinion publique, sont importants, car notre mission collective
consiste en grande partie à expliquer inlassablement les raisons et les arguments
qui sous-tendent les décisions du Conseil des gouverneurs.
Décentralisation, enfin : Étant donné que le principe de subsidiarité constitue
l’assise de toute la construction européenne, la décentralisation est un principe
majeur qui gouverne l’architecture de l'Eurosystème. L'Eurosystème est une
équipe dont les membres travaillent en étroite coopération, et l’esprit d’équipe y
est véritablement solide et fructueux. Les décisions de politique monétaire sont
prises, au niveau central, par le Conseil des gouverneurs, mais elles sont mises
- 4 -
en œuvre par les banques centrales nationales de manière étroitement
coordonnée.
LA STRATÉGIE DE LA POLITIQUE MONÉTAIRE UNIQUE
Le Traité de Maastricht définit clairement l’objectif final de la politique
monétaire unique, à savoir le maintien de la stabilité des prix. À cet effet,
toutefois, il est essentiel d’avoir une définition claire de la stabilité des prix : elle
consiste en une progression sur un an de l’indice des prix à la consommation
harmonisé (IPCH) inférieure à 2 % dans l’ensemble de la zone euro.
Pour atteindre cet objectif, notre stratégie de politique monétaire repose sur deux
« piliers ».
Nous avons tout d’abord assigné un rôle essentiel à l’agrégat monétaire M3. Ce
« pilier » est fondé sur une valeur de référence que nous avons fixée à 4,5 %
pour la croissance annuelle de l’agrégat monétaire large M3. Le concept de
valeur de référence n’implique pas un engagement de l'Eurosystème à corriger
de façon automatique les écarts susceptibles d’apparaître à court terme entre la
croissance monétaire et la valeur de référence. Naturellement, nous suivons
également attentivement l’évolution des contreparties de M3, c’est-à-dire les
sources de la création monétaire, et plus particulièrement les crédits à
l’économie, l’évolution des finances publiques et des mouvements de capitaux
avec le reste du monde.
Il va sans dire, toutefois, que l’examen des évolutions monétaires ne suffit pas
pour permettre une évaluation exhaustive des risques pesant sur la stabilité des
prix. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous avons défini un second « pilier » pour
appuyer notre stratégie de politique monétaire. Il se fonde sur une large gamme
- 5 -
de variables qui servent d’indicateurs avancés des perspectives d’évolution des
prix dans la zone euro.
En effet, nous considérons que le maintien de la stabilité des prix à moyen terme
constitue la principale contribution que puisse apporter l'Eurosystème pour
favoriser un environnement propice à une croissance soutenable et à l’emploi
sur le long terme. Il est également la meilleure contribution que puisse apporter
la politique monétaire afin de limiter d’inutiles fluctuations de la production et
de l’emploi à court terme.
Le niveau relativement bas des rendements des obligations à long terme libellés
en euros confirme la confiance des investisseurs dans la nouvelle monnaie. Ce
n’était pas le cas il y a quatre ou cinq ans, avant la création de l’euro, les
marchés étant alors convaincus que l’euro serait la moyenne arithmétique
pondérée des monnaies composantes et qu’il n’hériterait donc pas du capital de
confiance et de crédibilité des monnaies européennes les plus fortes, comme le
mark allemand, le florin néerlandais ou le franc français. L’euro bien au
contraire a été fondé sur le principe d’alignement sur les meilleures
performances (benchmarking) et non sur celui de la convergence vers une
moyenne. C’est sans doute la raison pour laquelle il a bénéficié dès le départ des
taux d’intérêt les plus bas d’Europe.
UN CADRE TECHNIQUE EFFICIENT
Cependant, même la meilleure stratégie de politique monétaire a besoin d’un
cadre technique efficient. L’introduction de l’euro sur les marchés de capitaux,
le 1er janvier 1999, s’est révélée un succès incontestable d’un point de vue
technique. À cet égard, trois points méritent d’être soulignés :
- 6 -
- le cadre de politique monétaire recouvre toute une palette d’instruments
dont le choix répond à un souci de respect des principes de marché, d’égalité
de traitement, de simplicité et de transparence. La décentralisation des
opérations de politique monétaire a, sans aucun doute, contribué au
fonctionnement harmonieux de ce cadre. Le fait de maintenir des contacts
étroits entre les banques commerciales et les banques centrales nationales
respectives a aidé les marchés à adopter rapidement des pratiques
harmonisées s’agissant des opérations d’open market, des garanties éligibles
aux opérations de refinancement et du mécanisme de réserves obligatoires.
- l’efficacité opérationnelle est illustrée par la précision de l’ajustement de la
liquidité bancaire et l’efficacité du pilotage des taux d’intérêt à court terme ;
l’Eurosystème a démontré cette efficacité dans les jours qui ont suivi les
évènements du 11 septembre 2001, en agissant sans retard et en veillant à
garantir le bon fonctionnement des marchés de capitaux européens.
- la sécurité est assurée par les procédures et systèmes mis en place, en ce qui
concerne tant l’exécution des opérations interbancaires que les paiements de
gros montant. L’intégration du marché interbancaire s’est opérée grâce à la
mise en place de Target pour le transfert en temps réel des paiements de
montant élevé dans l’ensemble de la zone euro et dans les autres pays de
l’UE.
Je vais maintenant aborder la question de l’introduction de l’euro fiduciaire, qui
a représenté la dernière étape d’un processus d’intégration monétaire engagé
depuis plus de vingt ans.
- 7 -
LE PASSAGE À L’EURO
Le 1er janvier 2002 ont été émis les pièces et billets en euros, qui ont depuis cette
date cours légal dans les pays membres de la zone euro. Il s’agit ici d’un
événement unique et hautement symbolique pour l’Europe.
En ce qui concerne la France, le passage anticipé à l’euro scriptural en 2001 et
l’introduction rapide des billets et pièces en euros début 2002 ont été une
réussite, conforme en tous points aux scénarios élaborés en consultation avec
l’ensemble des parties concernées (secteur bancaire, sociétés de transport de
fonds, police, forces armées, commerçants et grand public).
En France, près de 70 % des paiements scripturaux s’effectuaient en euros fin
décembre 2001. Depuis le 1er janvier, l’ensemble des opérations est libellé en
euros et il n’a été fait état d’aucun incident majeur, grâce à l’utilisation anticipée
des moyens de paiements scripturaux en euros par le grand public au second
semestre 2001. C’était également un facteur décisif pour l’acceptation rapide des
pièces et billets en euros par le public.
On a constaté le même succès dans l’ensemble des pays européens, grâce aux
efforts consentis au niveau national et à la coordination opérée par la
Commission européenne et l’Eurosystème ; un mois et demi après l’introduction
des billets et pièces en euros, plus de 95 % des opérations en monnaie
fiduciaire dans la zone euro sont désormais réalisées en euros.
Même si le passage pratique à la monnaie unique peut être considéré comme un
succès remarquable, certains points imposent néanmoins de rester vigilants :
- 8 -
- premièrement, la stabilité des prix. Bien que l’on ait fait état de certains
relèvements de prix à la consommation, globalement, l’incidence sur la
stabilité des prix devrait rester très limitée. Cependant, les consommateurs
doivent rester vigilants, les commerçants ainsi que les entreprises doivent
adopter un comportement responsable en matière de fixation des prix, et la
concurrence contribuera alors à faire baisser les prix à court ou moyen terme.
- deuxièmement, il convient de surveiller de près le risque de contrefaçon des
pièces et billets : la campagne de communication de l’Eurosystème,
intitulée « l’Euro, notre monnaie » avait pour objet de familiariser les
citoyens européens avec leurs nouveaux billets et pièces (et leurs signes de
sécurité) et de les aider à reconnaître sans difficulté les billets manifestement
faux. L’ensemble des institutions concernées, tant nationales qu’européennes,
coopèrent étroitement pour prévenir et combattre la contrefaçon.
La crédibilité de l’Eurosystème et de la politique monétaire unique, ainsi que la
réussite du passage à l’euro constituent des succès remarquables. Ils contribuent
assurément au fonctionnement efficace de l’UEM et à l’intégration économique
et financière européenne, comme je vais maintenant l’exposer.

L’UEM EST UN CONCEPT EQUILIBRÉ FAVORISANT
L’INTEGRATION ECONOMIQUE ET FINANCIERE
L’UEM est un concept économiquement  fondé et rationnel
LES CRITIQUES HABITUELLES…
Il y a quelques années, il était nécessaire de convaincre un grand nombre de
sceptiques, en Europe comme dans le reste du monde, que l’euro deviendrait une
réalité. L’opinion selon laquelle l’euro ne verrait jamais le jour a bien
évidemment été démentie par les faits. Néanmoins, on entend encore parfois
s’exprimer des objections, au motif que l’économie de la zone euro serait
caractérisée par d’importantes divergences susceptibles de mettre en péril et de
remettre en cause l’existence de l’UEM.
Selon certains observateurs, l’absence de coordination entre les politiques
économiques en Europe, serait, faute d’une fédération politique, de nature à
priver la zone d’un policy mix approprié. D’autres critiquent l’absence
d’instruments permettant de réagir à d’éventuels chocs asymétriques et
soulignent le faible degré de flexibilité et l’absence de mobilité de la main-
d’œuvre en Europe. D’autres enfin affirment que les divergences économiques
et structurelles supposées exister entre les pays de la zone euro sont trop
importantes pour garantir la viabilité de l’union monétaire.
…SEMBLENT INVALIDÉES DU POINT DE VUE ÉCONOMIQUE
Quelle réponse apporter à ces détracteurs ?
1) Pour permettre un bon fonctionnement de l’UEM, les Etats membres,
notamment les grands pays en termes de PIB, doivent indiscutablement être
conscients des répercussions de leur politique budgétaire nationale.
- 10 -
L’existence de ces retombées justifie la mise en œuvre d’une étroite
coordination entre les politiques économiques nationales. Cette obligation
figure dans le Traité, en vertu duquel les États membres doivent traiter leurs
politiques économiques « comme une question d’intérêt commun » et qui
prévoit une procédure multilatérale.
2) À cette fin, les États membres ont mis en place des institutions et des
mécanismes destinés à développer cette coordination. De fait, un cadre
opérationnel cohérent a été mis en place pour la coordination des politiques
économiques par la voie d’une surveillance mutuelle (placé sous la
responsabilité de « l’Eurogroupe » et du Conseil Ecofin) et grâce à la mise en
œuvre du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance, ainsi que je l’ai évoqué
précédemment. En outre, les Grandes orientations de politique économique,
approuvées chaque année par les Chefs d’État et de gouvernement,
contribuent au suivi des évolutions macroéconomiques et structurelles dans
les États membres.
Je vais désormais rappeler certaines dispositions du Traité à l’origine de
l’importance du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance :
- en surveillant les politiques budgétaires des États membres de la zone euro,
le Pacte, conjointement avec les Grandes orientations de politique
économique, veille à la mise en œuvre d’un policy mix approprié dans la zone
euro. C’est là un élément indispensable à la politique monétaire, pour
contrebalancer le fait que l’Europe ne dispose pas d’un important budget
fédéral, de même qu’elle n’a pas de gouvernement fédéral.
- 11 -
- le Pacte contribue également à éviter que des économies bien gérées aient à
supporter une prime de risque injustifiée en instituant un système de
sanctions pour les déficits excessifs.
S’agissant du second reproche couramment adressé à l’UEM, c’est-à-dire
l’absence d’instruments de réponse à des chocs asymétriques, je voudrais
souligner que le Pacte de Stabilité et de croissance lui-même nous permet
d’infirmer cette thèse. De fait, en incitant les États à tendre à moyen terme vers
une situation budgétaire « proche de l’équilibre ou en excédent », le Pacte les
habilite à tolérer –en période difficile- une augmentation des déficits à condition
de ne pas dépasser la valeur de référence de 3 %. En bref, il les autorise à créer,
durant les phases de conjoncture économique normales, un volant de sécurité
budgétaire qui peut être utilisé pour faire face à des divergences économiques ou
à des chocs asymétriques.
La dernière série de critiques porte sur les divergences économiques supposées
entre économies de la zone euro. Afin de répondre à cette objection, je voudrais
avancer quelques idées :
- premièrement, l’union monétaire n’implique pas nécessairement que tous les
pays membres affichent, à tout moment, le même taux d’inflation ou de
croissance, même si la création de l’euro reposait sur la réalisation effective
du processus de convergence. Ainsi, des écarts d’inflation entre pays ou
régions sont acceptables dans une union monétaire car il s’intègrent dans le
processus de convergence de la productivité et des niveaux de vie.
- deuxièmement, je voudrais citer le professeur Mundell à l’appui de l’UEM ;
on doit en effet à celui-ci une intéressante clarification, datant de début 1998,
du concept de zone monétaire optimale dans laquelle il démontrait que, dans
- 12 -
l’hypothèse d’un transfert de demande d’un pays à l’autre, à l’origine de
problèmes de chômage dans le premier et de tensions inflationnistes dans le
second, des taux de change flexibles ne pourraient résoudre ces difficultés. Je
cite : « Si la thèse de la dévaluation était valable, elle pourrait s’appliquer à
tout pays ou toute région, avec une prolifération de nouvelles monnaies, afin
de pouvoir les dévaluer ! ».
La coordination entre politiques économiques est du ressort des autorités. Mais
l’UEM signifie également l’harmonisation des marchés de biens et de services et
des marchés de capitaux. Or, dans ces domaines, le processus d’intégration est
bien avancé.
L’UEM favorise l’intégration économique et financière
L’EUROPE FINANCIÈRE EN CONSTRUCTION : RÉORGANISATION DES
MARCHÉS DE CAPITAUX
En 1999, dès le lancement de l’euro, l’un des avantages attendus résidait dans la
perspective d’un approfondissement, d’un élargissement et d’une plus grande
intégration des marchés de capitaux, évolutions de nature à réduire le coût du
capital pour les entreprises et à offrir aux épargnants européens une palette
accrue d’options susceptibles d’être utilisées pour leurs placements. Ces attentes
sont devenues réalité tant sur le marché monétaire que sur les autres
compartiments des marchés de capitaux.
Sur le marché monétaire de l’euro, l’intégration du marché interbancaire des
dépôts en blanc est très élevée. L’Eonia et l’Euribor constituent auprès du
marché des taux de référence unanimement reconnus par l’ensemble des
opérateurs, comme l’atteste la très forte progression du marché des swaps de
- 13 -
taux d’intérêt en euros.  Ces évolutions ont conduit les opérateurs à concentrer
leur activité de trésorerie en euros, afin de tirer parti de la plus grande liquidité
du marché secondaire.
Sur le marché obligataire de l’euro, le processus d’intégration a été marqué
par trois grands changements :
- une internationalisation rapide : l’introduction de l’euro a favorisé le
développement du marché de titres obligataires privés libellés en euros, grâce
à une base élargie d’investisseurs, notamment internationaux. Si l’on examine
la ventilation par devises sur la période 1990-98, seules 10 % des émissions
du secteur privé résidant dans la zone euro étaient libellées en monnaies
nationales de la future zone; ces mêmes monnaies ne représentaient que 2%
des émissions effectuées par les entreprises non résidentes ; depuis 1999, ces
pourcentages s’établissent à 75 % et 20 % (cf.Galati et Tsatsaronis, 2001) .
- le renforcement de la concurrence entre émetteurs, qui a favorisé
l’harmonisation des différents compartiments de titres souverains, la
convergence progressive vers les « meilleures pratiques », et le
développement de plusieurs emprunts de référence faisant l’objet d’une
demande et de transactions importantes sur le marché secondaire (titres
souverains, notamment). En outre, la concurrence a permis d’améliorer la
liquidité, les émetteurs ayant accru le montant moyen de leur encours.
- la modernisation des structures de marché : outre le développement du
courtage électronique (e-trading), le mouvement de concentration observé
chez les dépositaires centraux de titres favorise un fonctionnement plus
efficient des procédures de règlement-livraison ainsi que la mise en œuvre de
modalités de règlement plus simples et plus sûres des opérations
- 14 -
transfrontières sur titres. Ce dernier point présente une importance toute
particulière pour l’Eurosystème, le fonctionnement harmonieux de
l’infrastructure de règlement des titres au sein de l’Union européenne étant
essentiel à la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire.
Sur le marché des actions, l’élimination du risque de change entre les différents
pays de la zone euro a amené les investisseurs à renforcer la composante
internationale et sectorielle dans leurs choix de portefeuille et à ne plus se
limiter à une optique nationale. La création de plusieurs indices sectoriels
paneuropéens a ainsi été une conséquence directe de ces modifications de la
stratégie des investisseurs.
En outre, l’euro a constitué un important élément catalyseur de l’activité de
fusion et acquisition dans le secteur financier. À cet égard, il convient de
souligner la vague de fusions ou d’alliances intervenant actuellement au sein des
banques, bourses de valeur, systèmes de règlement de titres et chambres de
compensation. Aurait-on pu envisager EURONEXT, résultat de la fusion entre
le bourses de Paris, Bruxelles et Amsterdam, s’il n’y avait pas eu la création de
l’euro ?
UN GRAND MARCHÉ EUROPÉEN DE BIENS ET SERVICES
De tels changements apportés au paysage financier européen ont sensiblement
amélioré l’efficience de l’allocation du capital. Grâce à l’euro, les épargnants
européens ont la possibilité de choisir les placements les plus efficients. L’euro
permet également aux entreprises du secteur concurrentiel de réaliser
d’importantes économies d’échelle, il renforce la transparence du marché et
accroît la concurrence et l’innovation au profit des consommateurs.
- 15 -
Par ailleurs, la monnaie unique a été un élément moteur du renforcement de
l’internationalisation de l’économie de la zone euro. Je ne citerai qu’un exemple,
le niveau des flux cumulés d’investissements directs français à l’étranger depuis
1999, qui est de 380 milliards d’euros environ (soit quatre fois le niveau
antérieur à l’instauration de l’euro) et du même ordre de grandeur que les flux
d’investissements directs des États-Unis à l’étranger.
LE RÔLE INTERNATIONAL DE L’EURO
L’euro est devenu une devise internationale de premier plan. S’agissant de son
rôle officiel de monnaie de réserve, il se place au deuxième rang mondial,
derrière le dollar. En ce qui concerne son utilisation privée comme monnaie de
placement et de financement, l’euro joue un rôle considérable depuis fin 1998 et
représente 35 % des émissions de titres obligataires internationaux en 2001,
d’après les dernières statistiques bancaires internationales publiées par la BRI ;
la part de l’euro dans les dépôts bancaires internationaux s’est également accrue
considérablement au cours des deux dernières années.
En outre, l’euro constitue l’une des principales devises de référence adoptées par
des pays tiers dans le cadre des régimes de change. Plus de 50 pays au monde,
principalement européens et africains, ont adopté des dispositifs de change
incluant une référence à l’euro. L’importance des échanges et des liens
financiers avec la zone euro sont les facteurs essentiels à l’origine de ce choix.
Certes, l’adoption d’un dispositif de change ancré sur l’euro est une décision
unilatérale et n’entraîne pas d’engagement pour l’Eurosystème. Toutefois, le
rôle croissant de l’euro comme devise de référence ainsi que l’utilisation des
billets et pièces en euro à l’extérieur de la zone euro attestent de la confiance
attachée par les non-résidents aux politiques macroéconomiques de la zone euro
fondées sur la stabilité.
- 16 -
L’internationalisation de l’euro pourrait se poursuivre, à la faveur des bons
résultats enregistrés par l’Eurosystème en ce qui concerne son objectif principal
de stabilité des prix et grâce au renforcement de l’intégration des marchés
financiers dans la zone euro. Mais l’internationalisation de l’euro ne constitue
pas en soi un objectif de l’Eurosystème : de ce fait, ce processus n’est ni
encouragé ni entravé par l’Eurosystème. Néanmoins, cela ne signifie pas que ce
dernier n’intègre pas la dimension internationale dans ses choix. Il est évident
que nous tenons compte des répercussions possibles de l’environnement
extérieur en matière de politique monétaire. Néanmoins, les effets de
l’internationalisation de l’euro ne doivent pas être surestimés, dans la mesure où
la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème est suffisamment solide pour prendre en
compte et gérer au mieux ces incidences potentielles.
À ce stade, on peut se demander quels sont les facteurs d’une réussite totale de
l’euro et de l’UEM à moyen terme. À mon avis, une métaphore issue du rugby
s’impose : avec l’introduction des billets et des pièces en euros, nous avons
marqué un essai. Maintenant, nous devons le transformer. Je pense que nous
devons relever trois défis de taille : réformes structurelles, stabilité financière et
élargissement de l’Union européenne.
<U+2741> <U+2741> <U+2741>
LES DÉFIS À RELEVER 
Réformes structurelles
Le premier défi réside sans conteste dans la mise en œuvre au sein de la zone
euro des réformes structurelles, qui ont été formalisées lors du sommet de
Lisbonne : c’est ce qu’il est convenu d’appeler la stratégie de Lisbonne. Le
- 17 -
premier objectif de cette stratégie est d’accroître sensiblement notre croissance
potentielle ; le second consiste à renforcer la compétitivité de nos économies.
LA MISE EN ŒUVRE DES RÉFORMES : LA STRATÉGIE DE LISBONNE
À l’occasion du sommet européen de Luxembourg (décembre 1997), les
réformes structurelles ont été citées explicitement parmi les volets retenus en
vue du renforcement de la coordination des politiques économiques. Le sommet
de Lisbonne (mars 2000) a permis de renforcer la stratégie à moyen terme de
mise en œuvre  des réformes structurelles au sein de l’Union ; cette stratégie, qui
a pour objectif de faire de l’Union européenne l’économie de la connaissance la
plus dynamique du monde d’ici 2010, intègre depuis deux volets
supplémentaires : les questions sociales (sommet de Nice) et celles liées à
l’environnement (sommet de Göteborg).
Le travail effectué à ce jour dans le domaine des réformes structurelles est plutôt
encourageant : des succès non négligeables ont été enregistrées pour certaines
politiques, telles que les nouvelles réglementations relative aux marchés des
télécommunications, de l’électricité et du gaz. Avant de passer en revue les
domaines prioritaires nécessitant un nouvel élan, je souhaiterais faire deux
brèves remarques :
- premièrement, la compétence en matière de réformes structurelles incombe
aux États-membres. De ce fait, les solutions institutionnelles et les dispositifs
réglementaires varient suivant les secteurs et les États. Je considère
néanmoins que cette approche décentralisée est une chance plutôt qu’un
inconvénient.
Elle encourage des échanges réciproques et la diffusion des meilleures pratiques
par le biais d’une coordination renforcée des politiques structurelles.
- 18 -
- deuxièmement, le passage à l’euro constitue en soi une réforme structurelle
majeure et un puissant facteur de restructuration de l’économie européenne :
c’est un levier permettant la comparaison immédiate des prix, des
prélèvements obligatoires et des revenus.
ACCÉLÉRER LA CROISSANCE DU PIB POTENTIEL DE L’ÉCONOMIE
EUROPÉENNE CONSTITUE UN OBJECTIF ESSENTIEL
Si la France et l’Europe sont déterminées à avoir une croissance durable aussi
élevée que possible, la variable-clé est la croissance potentielle. Il existe trois
moyens d’élever le niveau de la croissance potentielle :
Premièrement, dynamiser l’investissement : les chefs d’entreprise sont
totalement libres de localiser leurs investissements où ils veulent, en France, en
Europe, dans le monde. Il est donc important de créer des conditions
économiques, juridiques et fiscales les plus favorables possibles à
l’investissement en Europe. L’attractivité de l’Europe pour les investisseurs est
de ce point de vue essentielle : plus nous investirons, moins nous aurons de
tensions inflationnistes et plus la croissance potentielle sera forte.
Le deuxième moyen d’accélérer la croissance potentielle consiste à augmenter la
quantité de travail disponible : l’objectif central fixé par le Conseil européen de
Lisbonne consiste à faire passer le taux d’emploi de nos populations de 60 à
70 % en 10 ans, sachant qu’il avoisine 75 % aux États-Unis. Les réformes
nécessaires visent en particulier à supprimer les trappes à inactivité et à
pauvreté. Ainsi, en France, certaines mesures utiles ont été prises, notamment
des réductions des contributions sociales à la charge des employeurs en vue de
réduire le coût du travail. Il faut également que nous poursuivions nos efforts en
matière de formation et d’éducation.
- 19 -
Le troisième moyen d’élever la croissance potentielle est de favoriser
l’accélération des progrès de productivité du travail : la rapide transformation
des systèmes d’information devrait accentuer la transformation structurelle de
l’économie. Bien que l’euphorie liée à l’entrée dans une nouvelle ère
économique se soit un peu dissipée, les mutations économiques conservent un
remarquable potentiel. Cela peut contribuer à augmenter de façon significative
et récurrente la productivité du travail.
IL CONVIENT DE POURSUIVRE CETTE STRATÉGIE TOUT EN ACCROISSANT
LA COMPÉTITIVITÉ GLOBALE DE NOTRE ÉCONOMIE
Si l’on se rapporte à l’expérience passée, la stratégie française de compétitivité,
qui reposait sur la modération des hausses de coûts unitaires de production, nous
a donné un très grand avantage. Et cet avantage comparatif de l’économie
française a favorisé la croissance, les créations d’emplois et la solidité des
comptes extérieurs. Par conséquent, dans la situation actuelle, il est vital de
continuer dans cette voie et de maintenir un consensus multipartisan sur ce
processus de désinflation compétitive.
La compétitivité est également liée à l’harmonisation européenne dans d’autres
domaines, notamment dans les services. La plupart des barrières à l’échange
dans ce secteur semblent imputables à des réglementations nationales et
devraient être supprimées ou allégées.
Si le rôle de l’Eurosystème dans le processus de réformes structurelles est
principalement celui d’un « aiguillon », il est de premier plan en ce qui concerne
le maintien de la stabilité financière. Cela m’amène au deuxième défi que devra
relever l’UEM.
- 20 -
Stabilité financière
Comme toute banque centrale moderne et indépendante , l’Eurosystème et ses
composantes individuelles, les banques centrales nationales de la zone euro,
doivent remplir deux fonctions principales : tout d’abord assurer la
stabilité des prix, condition essentielle d’une croissance soutenue, et, ensuite,
préserver la stabilité financière, un défi grandissant dans un contexte
de globalisation de l’économie mondiale, d’amplification des cycles financiers
et économiques et d’accès instantané à l’information. J’insiste sur la nature
hautement complémentaire de ces deux objectifs : la stabilité des prix constitue
les fondations sur lesquelles est bâtie la stabilité financière.
L’ADÉQUATION DES DISPOSITIFS INSTITUTIONNELS EUROPÉENS À LA
STABILITÉ FINANCIÈRE.
L’adéquation des dispositifs institutionnels européens à la stabilité financière a
été examinée en profondeur au niveau de l’UE. Dans deux rapports, en avril
2000 et en avril 2001, le Comité économique et financier (CEF) a fait un bilan
des mécanismes réglementaires et prudentiels et examiné la question de la
gestion des crises financières. Selon ses conclusions, les dispositifs actuels
fournissent une base cohérente et flexible pour préserver la stabilité financière,
et il a recommandé un nouveau renforcement de la coopération transfrontière et
trans-sectorielle.
Je partage pleinement l’analyse présentée dans ces rapports et je souhaiterais
souligner ici les responsabilités particulières des banques centrales, en raison de
leur positionnement au cœur des systèmes financiers : leur rôle de fournisseur de
liquidité de l’économie, leurs contacts étroits et constants avec les
établissements de crédit, leur contribution à la surveillance bancaire et au
fonctionnement sûr et efficient des systèmes de paiement, et, au moins pour
certaines d’entre elles, leur contribution au fonctionnement sûr et efficient des
- 21 -
systèmes de compensation et de règlement de titres. En bref, un cadre
institutionnel au sein duquel les responsabilités de l’Eurosystème en matière de
politique monétaire dans la zone euro vont de pair avec les très vastes
responsabilités des banques centrales nationales en matière de surveillance des
marchés domestiques, et avec un renforcement de la coopération au niveau de
l’ensemble de la zone euro, semble approprié pour faire face aux changements
entraînés par les évolutions financières actuelles et l’introduction de l’euro.
DEUX POINTS D’IMPORTANCE PARTICULIÈRE POUR LE CADRE DE
RÉGLEMENTATION FINANCIÈRE
En conclusion sur ce sujet important, je soulignerai deux points particulièrement
essentiels dans le cadre de la réglementation financière en Europe :
- il existe encore certains obstacles à une poursuite de l’intégration des
marchés financiers de l’UE. A cet égard, l’Eurosystème a salué l’objectif de
la réunion du Conseil européen de Lisbonne en mars 2000 consistant à
accélérer la réalisation du marché intérieur des services financiers et à fixer
un calendrier strict de manière à pouvoir mettre en œuvre le plan d’action sur
les services d’ici 2005. Ce plan est régulièrement passé en revu par les
autorités européennes, et des progrès ont été faits. Je salue tout
particulièrement l’intention de la présidence espagnole de l’UE de donner un
élan supplémentaire au processus en cours. L’Eurosystème soutient
également les conclusions stratégiques du Comité présidé par A. Lamfalussy
sur l’intégration de marchés de titres européens ratifié par la réunion du
Conseil européen réuni à Stockholm en mars 2001 et approuvé par le
Parlement européen au début février 2002. Nous sommes convaincus que la
mise en œuvre de ces grandes orientations et les nouvelles structures de
coopération au niveau européen contribueront à permettre de bénéficier
pleinement de l’introduction de l’euro.
- 22 -
- Depuis les tragiques événements du 11 septembre et l’incidence qu’ils ont
exercée sur la stabilité financière, les inquiétudes relatives à la possible
utilisation du système financier pour financer le terrorisme se sont vues
conférer une grande priorité au sein du débat européen sur la réglementation.
La communauté internationale et, en son sein, la communauté financière,
devrait renforcer ses efforts pour traquer les fonds utilisés par le crime
organisé et le terrorisme. Nous ne réussirons pas du jour au lendemain, mais,
aujourd’hui, il existe une forte détermination politique de la communauté
internationale en faveur d’une coopération sur cette question. S’agissant de la
lutte contre le crime organisé et le terrorisme, nous ne pouvons plus accepter
que certains acteurs ne soient pas disposés à respecter les règles de la
coopération juridique internationale.
Au delà des réformes structurelles et de la stabilité financière, l’adhésion de
nouveaux états membres à l’Union européenne et à l’UEM est le troisième défi
que je citerai. Le dernier mais non le moindre.
Adhésion de nouveaux États membres à l’UE et à l’UEM
Douze pays d’Europe centrale, orientale et méridionale négocient actuellement
leur adhésion à l’UE. Selon le calendrier approuvé par le Conseil européen, ces
adhésions interviendront à compter du 1er janvier 2004. Cela confirme encore, si
cela était nécessaire, l’attrait de la construction européenne qui nous a apporté la
stabilité politique et les progrès économiques depuis près de 50 ans.
Les pays candidats ont accompli des progrès significatifs en matière de
stabilisation et de renforcement de leurs économies et de leurs institutions.
Depuis le début des années quatre-vingt-dix, on peut constater que ces pays ont
- 23 -
réalisé des progrès considérables, en dix ans à peine, sur la voie de la
convergence avec l’UE.
Néanmoins, les observateurs s’accordent à penser que, même s’il diminue,
l’écart en termes de PIB moyen par habitant entre les pays candidats et la zone
euro demeure encore assez important. En moyenne, le PIB par habitant en
termes de parité de pouvoir d’achat s’élève à 44 % environ de celui de la zone
euro tandis qu’exprimé en taux de change courants, il ne représente que 22 %
environ. L’ampleur de l’écart, ainsi que les différentiels de croissance limités
entre les deux groupes de pays donnent à penser que le processus de
convergence réelle sera très progressif et se poursuivra bien au delà des dates
envisagées pour l’adhésion à l’UE. En effet, la convergence réelle est essentielle
pour créer la cohésion économique au sein de l’UEM et promouvoir
l’intégration entre les États membres, contribuant par conséquent à réduire au
minimum le risque de chocs asymétriques ainsi que leurs effets.
L’Eurosystème, et la Banque de France notamment, suivent le processus
d’élargissement très attentivement. Permettez-moi d’évoquer ici quelques points
particulièrement importants, tant pour l’Eurosystème que pour les pays
candidats, du processus de rattrapage avec l’UE et de la réalisation de la
convergence.
– Tout d’abord, la convergence nominale avec l’UE constitue un objectif à
moyen terme. Le respect strict des critères de Maastricht sera décisif pour
rejoindre la zone euro, mais ne doit pas être considéré comme une exigence
immédiate pour rejoindre l’UE. En effet, le Traité sur l’UE requiert, comme
condition préalable à l’adoption de l’euro, un degré élevé de convergence
soutenable, ce qui suppose que des progrès préliminaires suffisants aient été
réalisés en matière de convergence réelle et structurelle. Par conséquent, la
- 24 -
poursuite de la convergence tant nominale que réelle devra être effectuée en
parallèle car elles vont toutes les deux dans le même sens.
-Deuxièmement, je sais que de nombreux pays candidats ont déjà  exprimé leur
intention de rejoindre le MCE II dès que possible après leur entrée dans l’UE.
Cette intention doit être accueillie favorablement, même s’il est clair que la
participation au MCE II ne devra pas nécessairement intervenir dans tous les cas
immédiatement après l’adhésion à l’UE, ni être limitée à deux ans seulement,
période incompressible pour l’adoption de l’euro. Il serait erroné de considérer
le MCE II comme une simple « salle d’attente » avant de rejoindre la zone euro.
Bien au contraire, le MCE II offre un cadre pertinent, suffisamment flexible et
crédible pour renforcer la convergence avec la zone euro avant l’adhésion à la
monnaie unique.
-Troisièmement, un système bancaire et financier solide et efficient est
essentiel. Des avancées significatives ont été réalisées ces dernières années en
matière de modernisation du secteur bancaire et d’ouverture du capital aux
investisseurs étrangers, ce qui a également renforcé l’intégration dans le système
financier de l’UE. Le rôle d’intermédiation du secteur bancaire demeure
fondamental pour l’utilisation efficiente du capital et pour une croissance
soutenue. Les progrès en matière de gouvernement d’entreprise, de
renforcement des cadres juridique et prudentiel qui confortent le secteur
bancaire et la lutte contre le blanchiment de l’argent sont également d’une
importance capitale.
<U+2741> <U+2741> <U+2741>
En conclusion, permettez-moi de vous livrer trois réflexions :
- 25 -
- Tout d’abord, vous vous souviendrez peut-être qu’il y a deux mois,  nombreux
étaient ceux qui prévoyaient que le passage à l’euro fiduciaire s’accompagnerait
d’énormes difficultés. Ces prédictions apocalyptiques ont été de nouveau
erronées. Le passage à l’euro fiduciaire n’a pas été seulement un grand succès
technique, mais il s’est également accompagné d’un véritable mouvement
d’enthousiasme populaire. À mes yeux, il s’agit d’un phénomène
particulièrement important et positif que l’on doit prendre en compte dans
l’Europe entière, y compris le Royaume-Uni.
- Deuxièmement, le diagnostic effectué par certains économistes de la
conjoncture internationale est aujourd’hui tout aussi sombre qu’il était optimiste
hier. Ces deux attitudes sont tout aussi excessives. Essayons de rester sérieux,
lucides, sereins et mesurés dans notre analyse, nos jugements et nos décisions.
Gardons-nous de ce très mauvais conseiller qu’est l’instinct moutonnier.
Méfions-nous des modes. En ce qui concerne la situation actuelle, nous devons
rester prudents et vigilants mais certains signes indiquent que la conjoncture aux
États-Unis et en Europe est en train de redémarrer, y compris en France. À mes
yeux, compte tenu de la stabilité des fondamentaux européens, il n’y a aucune
raison que le redressement de l’économie européenne intervienne après celui de
l’économie américaine.
-Troisièmement, la confiance est essentielle  dans la situation actuelle. La
confiance dans notre monnaie, la confiance dans sa capacité à conserver sa
valeur, la confiance dans la solidité de l’euro à moyen et long terme, enfin, la
confiance dans la capacité de la Banque centrale européenne et de
l’Eurosystème à assurer la stabilité des prix. Cette confiance qui est méritée par
la banque centrale est un actif très précieux pour les Européens. Elle constitue
un élément très important qui favorise la croissance : en effet la confiance des
- 26 -
consommateurs et par conséquent leur demande constituent actuellement la
principale force motrice de l’économie européenne.
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

L'EURO CINQ ANS APRES :
RÉALISATIONS ET NOUVEAUX DEFIS
25 MAI 2004
LAUSANNE
2
Mesdames et Messieurs,
C'est un grand plaisir pour moi d'être ici pour vous parler de la monnaie unique européenne qui
est l'une des réalisations les plus remarquables de l'Union européenne. Les pays européens ont
longtemps été divisés, et le continent européen vient juste de se réunifier avec l'entrée de dix
pays d'Europe centrale et orientale dans l'Union européenne.
Nous venons de célébrer il y a quelques jours, le 54eme anniversaire de la fameuse déclaration de
Robert Schumann, qui contient ces phrases célèbres : « L'Europe ne se fera pas en un jour [...]
elle se fera à partir de réalisations concrètes [...] créant des solidarités de fait entre les
peuples. » A vrai dire, il n'existe guère de fait qui crée davantage de solidarité que la
monnaie, et c'est pourquoi il s'agit d'une pierre fondamentale de l'édifice européen, même si elle
ne concerne encore aujourd'hui que 12 pays sur 25.
Je voudrais vous présenter, tout d'abord, les réalisations de la politique monétaire unique, et en
particulier analyser la réussite de l'euro, obtenue grâce aux fondements solides sur lesquels
il repose (Partie 1). J'aimerais, ensuite, aborder brièvement l'intégration économique : l'euro a
effectivement constitué un facteur puissant d'intégration économique et financière,
accentué aujourd'hui par son rôle international croissant (Partie 2). Ensuite, je voudrais
souligner que l'UEM, pour être un plein succès, devra faire face à des défis tels que la cohésion
budgétaire et les réformes structurelles (Partie 3).
PARTIE 1: LA RÉUSSITE DE L'EURO REPOSE SUR DES FONDEMENTS
SOLIDES
L'euro repose tout d'abord sur deux fondements solides : la politique monétaire unique (A),
d'une part, le bon fonctionnement de la coopération macroéconomique de l'UEM (B),
d'autre part.
A. Les réalisations de la politique monétaire unique
Après cinq ans, la politique monétaire unique conduite par l'Eurosystème, c'est-à-dire
l'ensemble constitué par la Banque centrale européenne et les 12 banques centrales des pays
membres de la zone euro, a été couronnée par de nombreux succès. Le passage à l'euro, sous
forme scripturale puis fiduciaire, en constitue très certainement l'événement le plus
emblématique.La monnaie unique a longtemps rencontré le scepticisme de nombreux
observateurs qui estimaient peu réaliste, en premier lieu, de lancer une nouvelle monnaie, dont
le nom lui-même n'a été fixé qu'au Conseil européen de Madrid de décembre 1995, et en second
3
lieu, d'envisager une politique monétaire unique pour un ensemble de pays qui, en dépit de la
rapidité de leur convergence, n'en présentaient pas moins des disparités importantes. La
perspective de la création de nouvelles institutions, en particulier la Banque centrale
européenne, a également été à l'origine de très nombreux débats. Les questions étaient
centrées principalement autour du cadre institutionnel et opérationnel (Al) et autour des
stratégies (A2) d'une politique monétaire unique. Aujourd'hui, nous pouvons évaluer ses
réalisations (A3).
A.1. Un cadre institutionnel et opérationnel moderne
Une abondante littérature a été consacrée au cours de la dernière décennie aux questions
relatives à l'indépendance des banques centrales, aux concepts de transparence et de stratégie
monétaire ou encore à la communication des décisions de politique monétaire.
Ayant bénéficié de cette expertise analytique et de l'expérience des banques centrales
nationales des pays membres, l'Eurosystème repose tout d'abord sur un cadre institutionnel
moderne, fondé sur les principes d'indépendance, de transparence et de responsabilité et,
enfin, de décentralisation opérationnelle.
A.1.1. L'indépendance de l'Eurosystème favorise la stabilité des prix
L'Eurosystème a pour mission prioritaire, d'après le Traité de Maastricht, d'assurer et de
maintenir la stabilité des prix. Ainsi que l'ont montré de nombreux travaux empiriques, la
performance anti-inflationniste d'une nation semble très fortement corrélée au degré
d'indépendance de sa banque centrale. L'indépendance de la Banque centrale européenne et des
12 banques centrales des pays membres de la zone euro est donc inscrite dans le Traité. Au plan
fonctionnel, cela signifie que, dans l'exercice de leur mission, ni la Banque centrale européenne
ni les banques centrales nationales de l'Eurosystème ne cherchent ni ne prennent d'instruction
des institutions communautaires, des gouvernements nationaux ou d'une quelconque autre
instance. Il s'agit là d'une pleine indépendance au sens institutionnel, opérationnel et financier.
A.1.2. La transparence et la responsabilité sont également essentielles pour gagner en
crédibilité
Naturellement, l'indépendance de ces institutions a pour contrepartie la transparence de leurs
décisions et la responsabilité vis-à-vis du public et de ses représentants. S'agissant
d'institutions nouvelles, comme la BCE, la transparence est encore plus essentielle pour en
asseoir la crédibilité et instaurer la confiance des agents économiques dans une monnaie. Pour
4
établir cette crédibilité, pour gagner cette confiance des agents, il est absolument impératif
d'être compris et pour cela, il est nécessaire d'être transparent.
Dans ce domaine également, les impératifs de responsabilité et de transparence sont inscrits dans
le Traité en termes très généraux, mais l'Eurosytème est allé au-delà des obligations
institutionnelles lui incombant, dans plusieurs domaines. En premier lieu, le Conseil des
Gouverneurs a précisé sa définition de la stabilité des prix (hausse inférieure, mais proche de, 2
% à moyen terme). En deuxième lieu, la BCE est allé au-delà des exigences de responsabilité
établies par le Traité en instituant des auditions régulières du président devant le Parlement
européen et des réunions informelles régulières avec l'Eurogroupe des ministres des Finances.
Un autre signe de transparence réside dans la publication régulière de rapports sur les évolutions
économiques et des analyses de la Banque centrale, dont le Bulletin mensuel de la BCE constitue
le vecteur le plus connu. Enfin, point le plus important, à l'issue de chacune des réunions
consacrées aux décisions de politique monétaire, le président et le vice-président de la BCE
tiennent une conférence de presse suivie d'un échange ouvert avec les journalistes, dont le détail
est publié sur le site internet de la BCE. Il est peut-être important de rappeler que la BCE a été la
première des banques centrales à se soumettre à ce type d'exercice, qui fournit une occasion
unique d'expliquer et de commenter les décisions de politique monétaire, immédiatement et de
façon détaillée.
En revanche, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a choisi de ne pas publier les procès-verbaux
de ses réunions. En effet, la publication des procès-verbaux présente certains inconvénients. Tout
d'abord, lorsqu'ils sont très détaillés, les participants risquent de « parler pour le procès-verbal »,
alors que, lorsqu'ils ne sont pas détaillés, ils ne présentent guère plus d'intérêt qu'un simple
communiqué. Ensuite, ils peuvent compliquer l'évolution des prises de position de ses membres
à la lumière des arguments développés. Enfin, ce qui est le plus important, dans le cas de la zone
euro, l'analyse des votes pourrait être lue et interprétée à la lumière de préoccupations ou
d'intérêts nationaux, ce qui serait fallacieux et pourrait menacer à la fois l'indépendance des
membres du Conseil des gouverneurs et la crédibilité de nos processus de prise de décision.
A.1.3. L'Eurosystème repose sur la décentralisation opérationnelle
Le troisième élément, la décentralisation opérationnelle, constitue une caractéristique
essentielle de l'Eurosystème. La répartition des rôles entre la BCE et les banques centrales
nationales constitue l'un des éléments de sa cohésion et son moteur principal. Selon ce
principe, les décisions de politique monétaire sont prises de façon centralisée, par le Conseil des
gouverneurs de la BCE, mais mises en <U+009C>uvre par les banques centrales nationales.
5
Contrairement aux États-Unis, l'utilisation de technologies et de moyens de communication
modernes a permis de réaliser les opérations de marché de façon simultanée dans toutes les
banques centrales nationales, et non pas de les concentrer en un point géographique donné. Le
même dispositif s'applique à d'autres domaines monétaires (gestion de trésorerie, systèmes de
paiement, etc.).
A.1.4. L'Eurosystème bénéficie d'un cadre opérationnel efficient
A côté de ce cadre institutionnel moderne, l'Eurosystème bénéficie également d'un cadre
opérationnel particulièrement efficient. Le succès du passage à l'euro en constitue, au plan
technique, une illustration particulièrement édifiante. Ce cadre opérationnel repose sur deux
grandes orientations principales :
- une gamme cohérente d'instruments de politique monétaire, élaborée selon les principes de
libre concurrence, d'égalité de traitement, de simplicité et de transparence : ces instruments
permettent l'ajustement de la liquidité bancaire et le pilotage efficace des taux d'intérêt ;
- des procédures garantissant un niveau élevé de sécurité pour l'ensemble des transactions
interbancaires et des paiements de montant élevé au sein de la zone euro et avec d'autres pays de
l'Union économique, en particulier le système Target, dont le rôle a été déterminant dans le
processus d'intégration du marché monétaire en euros.
A.2. Le cadre stratégique
Les succès de la politique monétaire unique reposent également sur son cadre stratégique, lequel
peut être caractérisé par deux éléments principaux : une définition quantitative de la stabilité des
prix et une orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire.
A.2.1. Une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix
La définition retenue par le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE en octobre 1998 a été
confirmée et clarifiée en mai 2003, à l'issue d'un examen approfondi de son cadre stratégique par
l'Eurosystème. Au terme de cet exercice d'évaluation, le Conseil des gouverneurs a précisé
que la stabilité des prix était définie par une croissance annuelle de l'IPCH proche de, mais
inférieure à, 2 % à moyen terme. Cette définition appelle plusieurs commentaires :
- en précisant que l'inflation devait être proche de 2 %, le Conseil des gouverneurs a tout
d'abord tenu à confirmer le caractère symétrique de sa stratégie en excluant les situations de
déflation. Cette précision permet également la prise en compte d'éventuels biais de mesure sur
l'indice des prix, ainsi que des écarts d'inflation au sein de la zone euro ;
- la définition quantitative de la stabilité monétaire rapproche le cadre stratégique de
6
l'Eurosystème de celui des banques centrales reposant sur un ciblage de l'inflation, en particulier
lorsque l'on considère une acception large de ce dernier, telle que celle présentée sous le
terme de « cible d'inflation flexible ». La grande différence repose sur le rôle des prévisions
issues d'un modèle économétrique, qui jouent un rôle prépondérant dans les stratégies « pures »
de ciblage de l'inflation, alors qu'elles ne sont qu'un élément, certes important, dans le
processus de décision du Conseil des gouverneurs de l'Eurosystème.
A.2.2. Une orientation « à moyen terme »
Quelles sont précisément les implications de cette orientation à moyen terme de la stratégie de
politique monétaire de la BCE ?
- La première est que la stratégie de politique monétaire unique n'a pas un horizon fixe,
déterminé une fois pour toutes ex ante, mais vise, dans la mesure du possible, à tenir compte
des « délais longs et variables de la politique monétaire » chers à Milton Friedman. La prise
en compte de cette incertitude est particulièrement importante dans le cas de la zone euro, dont
on ignore pour partie les « paramètres structurels profonds ». Plus prosaïquement, cette
orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire unique reconnaît qu'il est impossible, pour
une banque centrale, de contrôler avec exactitude la trajectoire des prix à très court terme.
- La seconde implication est que les indicateurs pertinents pour la politique monétaire
doivent refléter, de façon quasi-exhaustive, les principaux facteurs à l'origine de l'inflation
à court comme à long terme. De ce point de vue, la stratégie de politique monétaire cherche,
autant que faire se peut, à mobiliser une « information complète ». C'est ce que traduisent les
notions d'approche économique et d'approche monétaire (que l'on qualifie également
d'approche en deux piliers) qui sont reprises notamment lors des conférences de presse du
président de la BCE à la suite des décisions de politique monétaire. L'approche économique
passe en revue les indicateurs conjoncturels, économiques et financiers en rapport avec les
principaux déterminants de l'inflation à court terme ; l'approche monétaire repose quant à elle
sur l'explication monétaire de l'inflation à long terme. L'orientation à moyen terme de la
politique monétaire unique rend nécessaire l'articulation de ces deux approches
complémentaires du phénomène inflationniste. En cela, la stratégie de politique monétaire de la
BCE est plus complète que les stratégies de pur ciblage d'inflation ou de pur ciblage monétaire.
A.3. Les réalisations de la politique monétaire de la BCE
Quel premier bilan peut-on dresser après ces cinq premières années de mise en <U+009C>uvre de la
politique monétaire unique ?
7
Je voudrais souligner trois points essentiels.
- Premièrement, la réalisation des objectifs de politique monétaire :
Alors qu'elle a été confrontée à une série de chocs d'offre exogènes défavorables (sur les prix du
pétrole, les produits alimentaires, le prix des services), conduisant à une évolution de l'IPCH
supérieure à 2 % en glissement annuel de 2000 à 2002, et fluctuant autour de ce niveau depuis,
la politique monétaire unique est parvenue à stabiliser et ancrer, sur la totalité de la période
d'exercice, les anticipations d'inflation à moyen - long terme autour de 1,8 à 1,9%. Cela
représente un niveau proche de, mais inférieur à, 2 % conformément à sa définition de la
stabilité des prix. Et ceci, que l'on considère les anticipations d'inflation issues des enquêtes
(par exemple, Consensus Forecast, ou l'enquête de la BCE auprès des prévisionnistes
professionnels) ou celles dérivées des données de marché, notamment des titres d'État indexés
sur l'inflation. Malgré ces tensions sur les prix, les conditions de financement, qui reflètent
notamment le bas niveau des taux d'intérêt à court comme à long terme dans la zone euro, sont
restées particulièrement favorables. Ces bons résultats illustrent la crédibilité de la politique
monétaire unique.
- Deuxièmement, la compréhension et la prévisibilité des actions de politique monétaire :
Contrairement à certaines idées reçues, la plupart des décisions de politique monétaire ont été
parfaitement anticipées par les marchés. Ce diagnostic provient des études conduites par
l'Eurosystème mais également des rapports publiés par les « ECB Watchers », avec lesquels,
d'ailleurs, la BCE entretient des liens réguliers, notamment sous forme de conférences
annuelles. Une comparaison avec la Fed ne montre d'ailleurs pas de réelle différence entre les
deux institutions quant à la capacité des marchés à anticiper les décisions de politique
monétaire des deux institutions. C'est le signe de la transparence de la politique monétaire
unique. Le fait, notamment, que la BCE ait choisi d'autres moyens de communication que la
publication des procès-verbaux des réunions du Conseil des gouverneurs ne l'a pas
empêchée d'atteindre un niveau élevé de compréhension et de prévisibilité.
- Troisièmement, la confiance et l'approbation des citoyens européens :
Effectivement, l'euro s'est aisément imposé auprès des agents économiques et fait désormais
partie du quotidien des consommateurs européens. Et les enquêtes confirment que le public a
confiance dans l'euro, qu'il considère comme une monnaie solide, et dans l'Eurosystème en tant
que banque centrale. Il reste cependant deux facteurs de préoccupation. Le premier réside
dans la difficulté naturelle à évoluer vers un référentiel de prix entièrement nouveau-et il peut
s'écouler de nombreuses années avant que l'ensemble des agents économiques l'ait
complètement intégré. Le deuxième facteur est la perception de hausses de prix excessives par
8
les consommateurs, liée au passage à l'euro fiduciaire. En effet, l'attention du public s'est
concentrée sur un petit nombre de biens et de services qui ont subi des hausses anormales de
prix lors de cet événement, ce qui a conduit à une perception erronée du taux réel d'inflation.
Ce décalage entre l'inflation perçue et l'inflation effective devrait heureusement disparaître dans
un avenir proche.
B. Les procédures de surveillance multilatérale au sein de l'UEM
L'UEM, qui conjugue une politique monétaire unique et douze gouvernements responsables des
politiques budgétaires et des politiques structurelles, nécessite un cadre institutionnel pour en
assurer la cohérence. Pour que ce cadre soit pleinement opérationnel, il doit être simple, facile à
mettre en <U+009C>uvre et capable d'assurer des politiques budgétaires saines et soutenables. En effet,
les processus de surveillance multilatérale ont été conçus dès l'origine afin d'atteindre un
niveau de cohésion satisfaisant dans les politiques suivies par tous les États membres.
B.1. Un cadre de procédures de surveillance multilatérale
La mise en <U+009C>uvre de la surveillance est confiée à l'Eurogroupe (pays de la zone euro) et au
Conseil Ecofin (tous les pays de l'UE), conjointement avec la Commission européenne. La
surveillance mutuelle combine les procédures multilatérales de surveillance et de dialogue, le
respect de règles et de dispositions communes, et l'engagement des États membres à respecter les
bonnes pratiques et les objectifs communs. La construction européenne est un projet en évolution
constante et chaque réunion du Conseil européen a donné lieu, dans un passé récent, à des
processus qui ont pris le nom des endroits où les sommets se tenaient. Cela s'applique à des
processus relatifs à des domaines tels que les marchés du travail (processus de
Luxembourg), la réforme économique des marchés des biens et des capitaux (processus de
Cardiff) et le dialogue macroéconomique visant à promouvoir des évolutions salariales
responsables (processus de Cologne). Le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance (PSC) constitue un
autre processus de coordination et de surveillance, et le plus largement débattu de tous : il
consiste à examiner les politiques budgétaires nationales au niveau de la Communauté dans une
perspective à moyen terme. Au centre du processus de coordination se trouvent les Grandes
orientations de politique économique (GOPE), qui contiennent une évaluation à moyen terme
de l'état de convergence des politiques économiques nationales. Les GOPE jouent un rôle
crucial car tous les processus de coordination mentionnés précédemment doivent être
compatibles avec leurs recommandations. Les mises à jour du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance
et des GOPE sont présentées sur une base pluriannuelle et leur mise en <U+009C>uvre est examinée
9
chaque année.
B.2. Les pays adhérents respecteront les mêmes règles
Laissez-moi souligner le fait que les dix nouveaux États membres sont déjà habitués aux
processus d'examen mutuel. Depuis leur adhésion, le 1er mai 2004, la politique budgétaire des dix
nouveaux États membres a été soumise aux mêmes mesures d'examen que celle des autres États
membres. Les déficits budgétaires constituent une préoccupation essentielle pour les nouveaux
pays de l'UE. L'adoption de l'euro étant subordonnée au respect du critère de déficit
budgétaire au sens de Maastricht, ces pays sont maintenant contraints d'entreprendre des
réformes budgétaires substantielles, d'autant plus que leurs déficits proviennent
d'insuffisances structurelles.
PARTIE 2: L'EURO: UN MOTEUR PUISSANT POUR UNE PLUS GRANDE
INTÉGRATION ÉCONOMIQUE ET FINANCIÈRE ET UNE RECONNAISSANCE
INTERNATIONALE
Le renforcement du cadre opérationnel et institutionnel va de pair avec la convergence
croissante de la zone monétaire (A) et avec le renforcement du rôle de l'euro au niveau
international (B).
A. Les piliers d'une zone monétaire optimale
La convergence croissante résulte de la solidité des fondamentaux macroéconomiques (Al) et
de l'homogénéité économique (A2), renforcés par l'intégration du secteur financier (A3).
L'adoption d'une même monnaie par onze, puis douze pays européens constitue un fait sans
précédent. Cette adoption se justifie par une convergence croissante des économies en
question au cours des années quatre-vingt-dix. S'il semble abusif de considérer la zone euro
comme une zone monétaire optimale, au sens où l'entendait Robert Mundell, plusieurs
travaux récents ont cependant montré que le processus de convergence, l'homogénéité
économique, le degré de synchronisation des cycles d'activité et la propension des économies de
la zone à échanger entre elles se sont accrus depuis la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire
unique. Cette dernière, en réussissant également à ancrer, dans la totalité des pays membres, les
anticipations d'inflation à un faible niveau s'est montrée capable d'imposer un important degré
de convergence nominale. Enfin, l'Union économique et monétaire a mis ses membres à l'abri
des crises de change et des déséquilibres macroéconomiques qui caractérisaient, il y a encore
un peu plus d'une dizaine d'années, la situation européenne.
10
A.l. La zone euro se caractérise par des fondamentaux économiques solides
Les économies de la zone euro se caractérisent, en effet, par un important degré de
convergence structurelle, un faible niveau d'inflation actuellement proche de 2 %, et des
conditions monétaires et financières favorables à l'activité économique. Ces conditions de
financement favorables s'expliquent également par la bonne capacité de résistance des
systèmes financiers et bancaires de la zone euro aux divers chocs ayant affecté l'économie
mondiale : solidité des infrastructures, bonnes performances des banques et institutions
financières, progrès accomplis dans la conformité aux normes internationales. L'épargne
privée y est également abondante. En outre, la zone euro est une économie attractive du fait de
la qualité de sa main-d'<U+009C>uvre (près de 5 % du PIB y est, par exemple, consacré aux dépenses
d'éducation) et de ses infrastructures. Ces différents atouts lui ont permis de drainer près de 112
milliards d'euros d'investissement direct en 2003 (contre 82 milliards aux États-Unis).
A.2. L'homogénéité économique croissante favorise la transmission de la politique
monétaire
Si l'Union monétaire n'implique pas nécessairement que tous les États membres affichent, à tout
moment, le même taux de croissance ou d'inflation, un certain nombre de travaux empiriques
récents illustrent une homogénéité économique croissante au sein de la zone euro. En termes
d'activité tout d'abord, plusieurs travaux présentés sous l'égide d'un groupe de travail commun
entre le CEPR (Centre for Economie Policy Research) et l'Eurosystème montrent que la
corrélation entre les fluctuations cycliques de l'activité économique dans son ensemble, mais
également de la consommation et de l'investissement dans la plupart des pays de la zone euro,
déjà forte avant la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire unique, s'est accrue depuis 1999.
Selon certaines mesures, une composante «européenne» commune jouerait un rôle plus
important que les composantes nationales dans les fluctuations cycliques de l'activité dans la
plupart de ces économies. Le degré de corrélation entre cycles nationaux et cycle agrégé au
niveau de la zone euro varierait ainsi dans un intervalle compris entre 0,70 et 0,92. En termes
d'inflation, le degré de dispersion des rythmes d'inflation au sein de la zone euro ne serait pas
nettement supérieur à celui que l'on observe aux États-Unis où existent des forces de rappel -
telles que la présence d'un budget fédéral unique équilibrant les différences cycliques entre
régions, des marchés des biens et services et du travail plus unifiés, une politique monétaire
unique depuis 1913 - bien plus fortes que dans la zone euro. Ainsi, sur ces premières années
d'existence de l'UEM, l'écart-type du glissement annuel des prix dans les douze pays de la zone
euro serait, selon les estimations, proche de 1,1 contre 0,8 pour les quatorze régions des États-
11
Unis. Enfin, les mises à jour récentes de l'important travail de recherche effectué par
l'Eurosystème sur les mécanismes de transmission de la
politique monétaire unique tendent à indiquer une homogénéité croissante des réponses des
économies des pays membres aux impulsions de la politique monétaire.
A.3. L'intégration du secteur financier est presque achevée
L'introduction de l'euro a agi comme un catalyseur de l'intégration financière. Cette dernière est
quasiment achevée en ce qui concerne le marché monétaire de l'euro. Dès les premières
semaines de la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire unique, les différences de prix
constatées sur les marchés interbancaires nationaux se sont estompées rapidement pour
devenir inférieures à 5 points de base, ce qui correspond au spread bid-ask habituellement
constaté sur ce marché. Un mouvement d'intégration comparable s'est également produit sur les
marchés obligataires européens, où l'on a pu constater un resserrement des rendements des titres
d'État, ainsi que sur les marchés dérivés avec l'impressionnant développement d'Eurex et, dans
une moindre mesure, sur les marchés boursiers et le marché des émissions de titres de dette pour
les entreprises. La zone euro et, plus largement, l'Union européenne disposent à présent d'une
architecture financière cohérente. Tout d'abord, la mise en <U+009C>uvre du Plan d'Action pour les
Services Financiers, défini au Conseil européen de Lisbonne en mars 2000, est en cours
d'achèvement. Ensuite, le « processus Lamfalussy » devrait favoriser la mise en place d'une
nouvelle architecture institutionnelle dans le domaine de la supervision et de la réglementation
du secteur financier - c'est-à-dire des marchés de titres mais également des banques et des
assurances - en développant notamment des règles techniques plus flexibles et plus uniformes.
B. L'euro joue désormais le rôle de monnaie internationale et d'ancrage nominal.
Les données disponibles confirment le rôle croissant de l'euro au niveau international. Au
niveau régional, il joue un rôle d'ancrage de premier plan, ce qui en fait le précieux vecteur
d'une culture de stabilité.
Le rôle croissant de l'euro à l'échelle internationale résulte du développement à la fois de son
utilisation au niveau privé (B1) et de son rôle officiel (B2).
B.1. L'évolution de l'utilisation privée de l'euro
L'euro possède les fonctions-clés que l'on attribue à toute monnaie internationale : il s'agit déjà
d'une monnaie de placement et de financement de premier plan et d'un intermédiaire
important des échanges internationaux. Même s'il est encore limité, son rôle de monnaie de
12
facturation devrait se développer dans les années à venir.
B.1.1. Un instrument financier essentiel au niveau mondial
L'utilisation de l'euro en tant que monnaie de placement et de financement sur les marchés
internationaux de capitaux s'est développée de façon immédiate. En 2003, il représentait
presque 60 % des émissions nettes de titres de créance internationaux contre 33 % en 1998.
Aujourd'hui, près de 41 % de l'encours de titres de créance est libellé en euros contre 28 % en
1998, soit une proportion comparable à celle du dollar dont la part est demeurée
remarquablement stable durant cette période.
Un autre développement très remarquable est l 'émergence d'un marché de titres «
corporate », c'est-à-dire de titres émis par des entreprises, dont le volume a cru
significativement au cours des premières années de l'euro.
La meilleure allocation de l'épargne en Europe nécessite que les marchés de capitaux soient plus
efficients et davantage intégrés. Or, cette intégration n'est pas encore totalement achevée,
notamment en ce qui concerne les marchés des pensions, des dépôts et des titres.
La zone euro présente enfin un certain retard en matière de marché-actions. Selon les données de
la BRI, si 32 % des créances bancaires internationales étaient concentrées dans la zone euro en
2002, contre légèrement moins de 15 % aux États-Unis, la capitalisation boursière de la zone
euro ne représentait cependant que 16,1 % de la capitalisation boursière mondiale contre 48,5
% pour les États-Unis.
B.1.2. Un important intermédiaire des échanges
En tant qu'intermédiaire des échanges, l'euro représente 25 % des opérations de change, soit
moitié moins que le dollar. Cependant, la part de l'euro est supérieure à la somme des parts des
anciennes monnaies nationales européennes. Ce résultat n'était pas évident au moment de
l'introduction de l'euro.
<U+0095>    Un rôle croissant de monnaie de facturation/règlement
S'agissant de l'utilisation de la monnaie européenne dans le commerce international, entre 50
% et 60 % des échanges commerciaux de la quasi-totalité des pays de la zone euro avec le
reste du monde étaient libellés en euros en 2002. Cela vaut à la fois pour les exportations et les
importations. S'agissant du commerce des pays de l'UE avec les pays tiers, 54% des exportations
japonaises vers l'Union européenne ont été facturées ou réglées en euros en 2002 (44 % en 2000)
et 31 % des importations japonaises en provenance de l'Union européenne ont été libellées en
euros (contre 17 % en 2000).
13
Dans les pays où l'intégration avec la zone euro est très élevée, comme les pays d'Europe
centrale et orientale, l'utilisation de l'euro dans les échanges est également très marquée, 60
% à 80 % des exportations/importations étant facturées ou réglées en euros.
<U+0095>    Un rôle plus limité sur les marchés de matières premières
En revanche, l'utilisation de la monnaie unique est plus limitée sur les marchés de matières
premières, notamment du pétrole. Le dollar y joue encore un rôle prépondérant, qui devrait
perdurer, compte tenu des phénomènes d'inertie liés aux effets de « réseau ». Cela n'est pas
surprenant dans la mesure où l'acquisition d'un statut international constitue, à tous les
égards, un processus long.
Au total, ces évolutions soulignent le fait que l'euro a su inspirer confiance aux investisseurs
privés et favoriser une plus grande liquidité des marchés de capitaux.
B.2. Le rôle officiel croissant de l'euro
La demande croissante en faveur de l'euro comme monnaie de réserve et de référence a
également renforcé son rôle officiel.
B.2.1. Un facteur de diversification des réserves de change
L'euro est devenu un facteur stabilisateur du système monétaire international tout
particulièrement grâce à sa fonction de diversification des réserves internationales.
Selon les dernières données disponibles du FMI, l'euro est la deuxième monnaie de réserve après
le dollar. Sa part s'élevait à 18,7 % en 2002 contre 12,6 % en 1999.
Cette tendance offre à de nombreux pays un précieux volant de sécurité contre de fortes
fluctuations des changes, dans la mesure où les investisseurs publics peuvent diversifier leurs
avoirs de réserve.
La part croissante de l'euro dans les réserves de change internationales devrait encore
progresser au cours des prochaines années. Les principales banques centrales asiatiques ont
exprimé leur intention de mieux équilibrer la part de l'euro et du dollar dans leurs avoirs,
phénomène d'autant plus important que le poids relatif de cette région dans les réserves de
change internationales est élevé. Lorsqu'elles seront pleinement mises en <U+009C>uvre, ces
décisions pourraient donc entraîner un rééquilibrage des réserves de change internationales en
faveur de l'euro : le dollar en représente actuellement 64,5 % contre 18,7 % pour l'euro.
B.2.2. Un facteur de stabilité pour de nombreux régimes de change
Loin d'être la simple addition des monnaies européennes précédentes, l'euro a hérité des
14
caractéristiques les plus intéressantes des anciennes monnaies nationales. Les effets positifs en
ont été notables. L'euro a mis un terme aux crises de changes et a créé un environnement de
taux d'intérêt historiquement bas. Même si ces deux éléments sont parfois oubliés, il est
intéressant de remarquer que l'Europe n'a pas connu de tumulte à la suite, par exemple, des
incertitudes créées par les récentes tensions géopolitiques au plan mondial, qui auraient
provoqué, dans le passé, de vives turbulences.
Ces avantages sont peut-être encore plus précieux pour les pays voisins, puisque 51 d'entre eux
ont déjà adopté l'euro comme monnaie de référence pour leurs régimes de change, soit comme
ancre unique (dans 30 cas environ), soit comme composante d'un panier de monnaies.
L'utilisation de l'euro dans les régimes de change des pays tiers concerne essentiellement des
régions qui ont tissé des liens étroits avec la zone euro ou qui ont mis en place des
arrangements institutionnels spéciaux avec l'UE (pays adhérents et candidats, Balkans,
Afrique du nord et zone franc CFA). Dans tous les cas, ces régimes de change résultent d'une
décision unilatérale, qui n'implique aucun engagement de la part de l'Eurosystème.
Cependant, des liens étroits avec l'euro peuvent avoir comme effet d'« importer» de la
crédibilité, à condition de poursuivre simultanément des politiques appropriées.
Plus fondamentalement, l'euro contribue à développer une culture de la stabilité dans un
grand nombre de pays, car il permet également d'influencer les anticipations des agents
économiques. Certes, il n'est pas possible, en l'espace de quelques années, d'évaluer
complètement les réalisations permises par l'euro, mais il apparaît clairement que la monnaie
unique fournit un bon exemple de la prospérité économique que peuvent procurer la discipline et
la détermination.
En ce qui concerne les dix nouveaux pays de l'UE, laissez-moi souligner que le critère de
stabilité des taux de change au sein du MCE II nécessite que cette stabilité soit atteinte avant
l'adoption de la monnaie unique. L'avantage est que l'adoption de l'euro sera le
couronnement d'un processus de convergence structuré au sein d'un cadre multilatéral. C'est
assurément l'un des défis les plus importants auxquels devra faire face la zone euro dans les
années à venir, défis dont je vais maintenant vous parler.
PARTIE 3 : LES DÉFIS DE LA MONNAIE UNIQUE
L'environnement dans lequel évolue l'euro étant en mutation continue, les pouvoirs publics
doivent faire face à de nouveaux défis lorsqu'ils formulent et mettent en <U+009C>uvre leurs décisions de
politique économique. Je voudrais attirer l'attention sur trois de ces défis qui, à mon avis,
15
pèseront fortement sur l'avenir de l'euro et de la construction européenne.
En premier lieu, il est nécessaire de renforcer la coordination budgétaire de l'UE afin de
consolider les fondements sur lesquels repose l'euro, dans une période où les politiques
budgétaires en Europe doivent faire face à des défis spécifiques tels que le vieillissement de la
population.
En deuxième lieu, il est nécessaire de mettre en <U+009C>uvre des réformes structurelles (B) afin de
mieux préparer les pays à affronter les défis à venir.
Enfin, le processus d'élargissement (C), qui est certes déjà une réalité, demandera des efforts
supplémentaires pour que les nouveaux États membres progressent encore et finissent par
rattraper leur retard.
A. La nécessité d'un renforcement de la cohésion et de la coordination budgétaires au sein
de l'Union
Le respect des règles et des procédures formulées dans le Traité et des dispositions du Pacte de
stabilité et de croissance imposent la même discipline budgétaire à tous les États membres
: le déficit budgétaire ne doit pas excéder le plafond de 3 % du PIB et le ratio d'endettement total
ne devrait pas dépasser 60 % du PIB. Ces limites contribuent à assurer un policy-mix optimal au
niveau de la zone euro, dans la mesure où une politique budgétaire laxiste risque, à terme, de
compromettre la réalisation de la stabilité des prix. Enfin, elles entretiennent une croissance et un
emploi durables et sont propices à la stabilité économique.
La discipline budgétaire est en effet d'une importance capitale pour l'UEM, car elle est un
corollaire nécessaire de la politique monétaire unique. On attend des États membres qu'ils
considèrent leurs politiques économiques comme des questions « d'intérêt commun », étant
donné l'incidence que leurs décisions budgétaires peuvent avoir sur la zone euro dans son
ensemble. Dans une union monétaire, il est de la plus grande importance de traiter les «
comportements de passager clandestin » (free-riding), d'où la clause de « non
renflouement » inscrite dans le Traité de Maastricht.
Le cadre institutionnel de la coordination des politiques économiques nationales a bien
fonctionné dans le passé. Cependant, les difficultés économiques auxquelles se sont heurtés de
nombreux pays européens ont suscité de vives critiques à rencontre des dispositions
budgétaires du Traité et du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Or, il ne s'agit pas d'améliorer la
formulation du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance mais plutôt les modalités de sa mise en <U+009C>uvre.
- Les règles elles-mêmes laissent une marge de man<U+009C>uvre suffisante pour faire face à un
ralentissement de la croissance. Conformément au concept d'équilibre des soldes budgétaires
16
structurels, les États membres de l'UE se sont engagés à atteindre et à maintenir, au cours du
cycle économique, une situation budgétaire «proche de l'équilibre ou excédentaire ». Cette
exigence doit permettre de faire face aux chocs asymétriques et aux fluctuations
conjoncturelles, tout en laissant les stabilisateurs automatiques exercer pleinement leurs
effets. Cette flexibilité est essentielle pour surmonter les chocs asymétriques tout en préservant la
soutenabilité à long terme des finances publiques et l'autonomie de la politique monétaire. Toute
amélioration susceptible d'être apportée à la mise en <U+009C>uvre de ces règles est dans l'intérêt même
des États membres.
- Le véritable problème est celui de l'application du Pacte : en particulier, des incitations
devraient être créées en vue de renforcer la mise en <U+009C>uvre d'une politique budgétaire saine
en période de haute conjoncture. Lorsque la croissance est forte, les pays doivent se mobiliser
encore davantage pour réduire leurs déficits ou dégager des excédents et réduire ainsi l'encours
d'une dette publique pouvant demeurer à des niveaux élevés. Cela signifie qu'en période de
conjoncture favorable, il faut adopter des politiques budgétaires moins laxistes pour garantir la
soutenabilité à long terme des finances publiques.
Le respect de l'objectif central d'équilibre budgétaire est d'autant plus indispensable que
l'Union européenne devra s'atteler au problème du vieillissement rapide de la population, dont
les implications sur les finances publiques sont considérables, tant sous l'angle des dépenses de
santé que des régimes de retraite. Étant donné que, dans ces domaines, les réformes risquent
de n'être perceptibles qu'à moyen et long termes, il est essentiel que les pays européens
prennent toutes les dispositions nécessaires pour prévenir les conséquences de ces évolutions
démographiques, notamment sur le plan budgétaire. La mise en <U+009C>uvre de politiques budgétaires
saines passe également par l'amélioration de la qualité des dépenses publiques. Un premier pas
dans cette direction consisterait à faire porter le processus d'ajustement sur les dépenses
courantes plutôt que sur l'investissement, à la différence de ce qui a été fait dans la plupart des
pays à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix. De manière plus générale, les pays de TUE doivent
entreprendre des réformes structurelles visant à renforcer le potentiel de croissance et à favoriser
la création d'emplois. Sur ces points, l'Eurosystème a appelé ces pays à maintes reprises et sans
ambiguïté possible à procéder à ces réformes.
B. Des réformes structurelles doivent être accomplies dans plusieurs domaines
Il subsiste néanmoins en Europe, en particulier dans la zone euro, d'importantes rigidités
structurelles qu'il s'agit de résoudre si l'on souhaite promouvoir la plus forte croissance non
inflationniste possible. Je souhaiterais ici évoquer plusieurs pistes qui font d'ailleurs l'objet d'un
17
consensus au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs de la zone euro. Elles portent notamment sur les
efforts à poursuivre en ce qui concerne le rôle et l'importance de la recherche (B1) pour
accroître le potentiel de croissance de la zone euro, le développement des « forces
d'agglomération » pour faciliter la localisation des entreprises (B2), les efforts à accomplir
enfin pour accroître la flexibilité sur le marché du travail et l'intégration des marchés des
biens et services (B4).
B.1. Une économie fondée sur la connaissance
S'agissant du premier point, la stratégie adoptée à l'unanimité lors du Conseil européen de
Lisbonne en mars 2000, qui a pour objectif de faire de l'Union européenne « l'économie de la
connaissance la plus compétitive et la plus dynamique du monde, capable d'une croissance
économique durable accompagnée d'une amélioration qualitative et quantitative de l'emploi et
d'une plus grande cohésion sociale », fournit un cadre de référence pour guider l'action publique.
Elle insiste notamment sur l'importance de la recherche, de l'innovation et de la diffusion des
technologies nouvelles pour élever le niveau de productivité de l'économie. Elle vise également à
donner à l'économie européenne ainsi qu'à tous les pays membres de l'UE plus de souplesse,
plus d'activité, et plus d'emplois. Il s'agit d'une stratégie certes ambitieuse mais cruciale pour
l'avenir de l'Europe et de la zone euro.
B.2. La compétitivité des entreprises
Dans ce contexte, en raison notamment de la concurrence internationale, il est également
crucial de développer les « forces d'agglomération », c'est-à-dire les incitations qui forcent les
entreprises à se concentrer géographiquement pour bénéficier d'économies d'échelle et externes.
L'existence d'une zone à pouvoir d'achat élevé est notamment l'un des facteurs importants de la
localisation des entreprises européennes. J'ai déjà mentionné les forces d'attractivité de la zone
euro mais il nous faut aller plus loin encore, en particulier en ce qui concerne la maîtrise des
coûts, notamment salariaux, et la nécessité d'assurer un environnement favorable à la
compétitivité des entreprises européennes. En effet, les emplois sont créés de préférence dans les
économies qui savent modérer leurs coûts unitaires de production et offrir un environnement
aussi favorable que possible à la compétitivité des entreprises. Cela suppose donc que soient
poursuivies, sinon accentuées les réformes structurelles sur le marché du travail et celui des biens
et des services.
B.3. La flexibilité sur le marché du travail
18
En ce qui concerne le marché du travail, la zone euro est caractérisée par un faible taux
d'emploi, proche de 62 % en 2002 contre 75 % aux États-Unis, ce qui se traduit par une perte non
négligeable en termes de PIB par habitant (près de 25 % inférieur à celui des États-Unis). Ce bas
taux d'emploi résulte du niveau élevé du chômage dans la zone euro, proche de 9 % actuellement
et de la faiblesse du taux d'activité. Le chômage en Europe étant pour l'essentiel d'origine
structurelle, il importe dès lors de fluidifier le marché du travail et de préserver une structure
d'incitations permettant d'élever le taux d'activité. Cela suppose notamment que soient mises
en <U+009C>uvre des mesures visant à réduire le coût du travail, les charges des entreprises mais
également que soient promues des structures d'incitations à destination des actifs parmi les
classes d'âges les plus jeunes mais également les plus âgées ainsi que pour les moins qualifiés.
Contrairement à ce que l'on observe aux États-Unis, où existe une longue tradition de mobilité
professionnelle et géographique, les différences culturelles et linguistiques constituent encore
un frein à la mobilité du facteur travail en Europe. La faiblesse de la mobilité
professionnelle et géographique dépend également d'une différentiation sans doute
insuffisante des salaires dans les pays de la zone euro qui permettraient de mieux refléter les
différences en termes de gains de productivité ou de développement entre régions ou secteurs
d'activité.
B.4. L'intégration des marchés des biens et services
L'accroissement du niveau de productivité dans la zone euro repose également sur
l'approfondissement des réformes sur le marché des biens et services car le retard européen, vis-à-
vis notamment des États-Unis, trouve également son origine dans la présence de rigidités
structurelles liées à l'existence de barrières à l'entrée sur ce marché. Or, en l'absence de pressions
concurrentielles, les entreprises ne sont guère incitées à accroître leur efficacité.
Des réformes réglementaires doivent donc être entreprises tant au niveau des pays membres
qu'au niveau de l'Union économique dans son ensemble. D'après les travaux de recherche
conduits sous l'égide du CEPR et de l'Eurosystème, la création du marché unique a déjà
constitué une étape majeure mais l'objectif reste bien celui d'une intégration complète du
marché des biens et services au niveau européen. Cela concerne notamment le secteur des
services où, il faut bien le reconnaître, les progrès ont été moins nets que dans les autres
secteurs d'activité. Certes, cela s'explique encore pour partie par des différences culturelles. Il
reste que les pouvoirs publics, au niveau national comme au niveau communautaire, doivent
poursuivre leurs efforts et favoriser le degré de concurrence et d'intégration dans tous les
secteurs d'activité. Je mentionnais celui des services, mais c'est également le cas des secteurs de
19
l'énergie, notamment électrique, des transports, notamment ferroviaires, ou encore des services
postaux.
C. Le défi de l'élargissement
Dix nouveaux pays ont rejoint l'UE le 1er mai 2004. Ils ont vocation à adopter l'euro après avoir
satisfait aux critères de convergence nominale. Au delà des défis institutionnels qui subsistent
(indépendance des banques centrales, adaptation de systèmes bancaires, lutte contre le
blanchiment, etc.), le défi majeur qui s'ouvre à nous est de relever le pari de la
convergence réelle entre l'Est et l'Ouest de l'Europe. Cet objectif nécessitera des années
d'importantes réformes structurelles favorables à une accélération de la croissance et au
comblement du fossé Est-Ouest ; il suppose notamment le respect du cadre macroéconomique
auquel tous les Etats membres partie à l'euro aujourd'hui ont consenti, notamment la
participation réussie au MCE2. Il faut en effet éviter toute précipitation dommageable à la
compétitivité et procéder aux réformes de fond, notamment en matière de soutenabilité des
finances publiques, préalablement à l'entrée dans ce mécanisme de change, gage d'une
convergence réelle durable profitable à l'ensemble de la zone.
Conclusion
Je souhaiterais conclure en disant que l'euro a répondu à toutes nos attentes. Après le défi sans
précédent du passage à l'euro fiduciaire à l'échelle du continent, qui a été couronné de succès,
l'euro a pratiquement remplacé instantanément les anciennes monnaies nationales, sans
perturbation logistique. Il a encouragé la stabilité grâce à la crédibilité dont il jouit et a protégé
nombre de pays de la zone contre la volatilité excessive des taux de change et les turbulences
enregistrées sur les marchés financiers. Ces résultats doivent être soulignés avec d'autant plus
d'acuité que pendant plusieurs années il avait été dit que l'euro resterait un « serpent de
mer » ou qu'il créerait des difficultés macroéconomiques importantes. Ces scénarios ne se sont
pas concrétisés.
L'euro représente donc une pierre angulaire majeure de la construction européenne. Cela dit, et
indépendamment de ses propres mérites, une monnaie ne constitue pas une fin en soi même si les
nouveaux États membres sont ardemment déterminés à l'adopter le plus vite possible. La
participation à l'union monétaire doit reposer sur un processus de convergence soutenable.
L'élargissement de la zone euro donnera à cet égard un nouvel élan au relèvement des défis, les
responsables de politique économique subissant désormais une pression beaucoup plus forte
dans le traitement des difficultés alors qu'ils pouvaient les ignorer auparavant. Il s'agit là d'une
contribution essentielle à la construction d'une union européenne plus forte à laquelle j'adhère
20
vigoureusement.
En conclusion, laissez-moi exprimer ma confiance en l'avenir de l'euro qui, cinq ans après sa
création, constitue le symbole patent de l'identité européenne et de sa force.

L<U+0092>EURO, FACTEUR DE STABILISATION POUR LA ZONE EURO
ET LE RESTE DU MONDE
21 MARS 2005
HONG KONG
2
INTRODUCTION
• La base juridique de la politique monétaire unique est le Traité instituant la Communauté
européenne dont l<U+0092>article 105 énonce que « l<U+0092>objectif principal du Système européen de banques
centrales est de maintenir la stabilité des prix ».
• La stabilité des prix, associée à la convergence des économies de la zone euro, est essentielle pour
que l<U+0092>euro devienne une monnaie internationale stable.
• Grâce à un cadre macroéconomique solide et à la convergence des économies de la zone euro,
l<U+0092>introduction de l<U+0092>euro a limité les risques de déséquilibre au sein de la zone (Partie 1). En outre, le
rôle international de l<U+0092>euro en tant que vecteur de stabilité s<U+0092>est accru (Partie 2).
1E PARTIE : L<U+0092>EURO A ÉTÉ UN FACTEUR DÉTERMINANT POUR LE MAINTIEN
DE LA STABILITÉ DANS LA ZONE EURO
Le cadre macroéconomique efficace de la zone euro (A) a rendu les économies de la zone plus
homogènes et a réduit les risques de déséquilibre macroéconomique (B). En conséquence, la zone euro
est caractérisée par des fondamentaux économiques solides (C).
A/ Le cadre macroéconomique de la zone euro est un cadre efficace
• Depuis six ans, c<U+0092>est l<U+0092>Eurosystème qui est responsable de la définition et de la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la
politique monétaire unique. L<U+0092>objectif principal de l<U+0092>Eurosystème est de maintenir la stabilité des
prix, définie comme une progression sur un an de l<U+0092>indice des prix à la consommation harmonisé
(IPCH) inférieure à 2% dans la zone euro à moyen terme. En mai 2003, le Conseil des gouverneurs
de la BCE a confirmé cette définition et précisé que, dans le cadre de l<U+0092>objectif de poursuite de la
stabilité des prix, il cherchera à maintenir, à moyen terme, une progression annuelle de l<U+0092>IPCH
inférieure à, mais proche de, 2%. La politique monétaire menée par l<U+0092>Eurosystème a conduit à un
faible niveau d<U+0092>inflation, celle-ci s<U+0092>étant établie à 2% en moyenne entre 1999 et 2004, et à des
conditions de financement très favorables, les taux d<U+0092>intérêt à court terme comme à long terme
ayant atteint des niveaux très bas.
• En outre, les politiques budgétaires ne peuvent pas, en principe, compromettre l<U+0092>objectif de stabilité
des prix, dans la mesure où le Traité interdit le financement monétaire du secteur public et que les
Etats membres se sont engagés à mettre en <U+009C>uvre le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Toutefois,
l<U+0092>absence de discipline budgétaire dans certains pays de la zone euro et le récent débat intervenu au
niveau de l<U+0092>UE ont montré qu<U+0092>il est encore nécessaire de renforcer l<U+0092>efficacité du cadre budgétaire
européen et, en particulier, le volet préventif du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance relatif à la
3
surveillance des situations budgétaires. Le cadre budgétaire inscrit dans le Traité sur l<U+0092>Union
européenne et le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance constitue une pierre angulaire de l<U+0092>Union
économique et monétaire et est, par conséquent, essentiel à la cohésion de l<U+0092>Union monétaire elle-
même.
B/ L<U+0092>introduction de l<U+0092>euro a renforcé l<U+0092>homogénéité des économies européennes et limité les
risques de déséquilibre macroéconomique dans la zone euro
Le processus de convergence, l<U+0092>homogénéité des économies européennes et la synchronisation des
cycles conjoncturels se sont renforcés depuis l<U+0092>introduction de l<U+0092>euro
• S<U+0092>agissant des cycles conjoncturels, certains travaux récents présentés par un groupe de travail
conjoint du CEPR (Centre for Economic Policy Research) et de l<U+0092>Eurosystème indiquent que,
depuis 1999, la corrélation entre les cycles conjoncturels considérés globalement et entre les
évolutions de la consommation et de l<U+0092>investissement s<U+0092>est accrue dans la plupart des pays de la
zone euro. Une composante européenne commune semble jouer un rôle plus important dans ces
économies que les composantes nationales. Le degré de corrélation entre les cycles nationaux et le
cycle agrégé de la zone euro varie entre 0,70 et 0,92.
• En ce qui concerne l<U+0092>inflation, les études effectuées par l<U+0092>Eurosystème montrent que le degré de
dispersion des taux d<U+0092>inflation dans la zone euro n<U+0092>est pas sensiblement plus élevé que celui
observé aux États-Unis, où le budget fédéral et le marché, beaucoup plus unifié, des biens et des
services donnent une marge de man<U+009C>uvre supplémentaire. L<U+0092>écart type de la croissance annuelle
des prix dans les douze pays de la zone euro s<U+0092>établit à 1,1 environ, contre 0,8 dans les quatorze
régions des États-Unis.
• Enfin, la mise à jour des abondants travaux sur les mécanismes de transmission monétaire menés
par l<U+0092>Eurosystème montre que, s<U+0092>agissant de la transmission des impulsions monétaires par le canal
des taux d<U+0092>intérêt, les économies des Etats membres sont plus homogènes depuis l<U+0092>introduction de
l<U+0092>euro.
L<U+0092>UEM a limité les risques de crises de change et servi de catalyseur de l<U+0092>intégration financière de la
zone euro
• L<U+0092>euro a mis un terme aux effets potentiels des crises de change et favorisé l<U+0092>émergence d<U+0092>un
environnement stable caractérisé par des taux d<U+0092>intérêt historiquement bas. Grâce à ces
évolutions, les pays de la zone euro n<U+0092>ont pas été confrontés à des difficultés liées aux récentes
incertitudes géopolitiques.
• L<U+0092>introduction de l<U+0092>euro a servi de catalyseur de l<U+0092>intégration financière européenne, qui est
totalement achevée en ce qui concerne le marché monétaire. Durant les premières semaines qui ont
suivi l<U+0092>introduction de l<U+0092>euro, les différences de prix observées sur les marchés interbancaires
4
nationaux se sont très rapidement réduites pour s<U+0092>établir à moins de cinq points de base. Ce niveau
correspond à l<U+0092>écart entre les cours vendeur/cours acheteur observé actuellement sur le marché.
• Une évolution comparable est intervenue sur les marchés obligataires européens, sur lesquels
les rendements des emprunts d<U+0092>Etat ont convergé.
• La zone euro, et plus globalement l<U+0092>Union européenne, disposent désormais d<U+0092>une
architecture financière cohérente. La mise en <U+009C>uvre du Plan d<U+0092>action pour les services
financiers, défini au Conseil européen de Lisbonne, est en voie d<U+0092>achèvement. Par la suite, le
processus Lamfalussy devrait fournir une nouvelle architecture institutionnelle dans les domaines
de la surveillance et de la réglementation financières et donner lieu à des règles techniques à la fois
flexibles et uniformes.
2e PARTIE : L<U+0092>EURO JOUE UN RÔLE DE MONNAIE INTERNATIONALE ET UN RÔLE
D<U+0092>ANCRAGE NOMINAL
Les données disponibles soulignent le renforcement du rôle international de l<U+0092>euro. Au niveau
régional, il joue un important rôle d<U+0092>ancrage et constitue le vecteur d<U+0092>une culture de stabilité. Le
renforcement du rôle de l<U+0092>euro au niveau international est lié au développement de son utilisation en
tant qu<U+0092>instrument financier et moyen d<U+0092>échange (A) ainsi que de son rôle d<U+0092>ancrage pour des régimes
de change (B).
A/ L<U+0092>euro occupe une place de premier plan en tant qu<U+0092>instrument financier et moyen d<U+0092>échange
• L<U+0092>utilisation de l<U+0092>euro en tant que monnaie de financement et d<U+0092>investissement sur les marchés
financiers s<U+0092>est accrue. Au premier semestre 2004, près de 36 % des émissions brutes de titres de
créance internationaux à long terme étaient libellées en euros contre 24 % en 2002. La part du
dollar des États-Unis a diminué, revenant de près de 50 % en 2002 à 39 %.
• Autre évolution significative, on a assisté dans la zone euro à l<U+0092>émergence d<U+0092>un marché des
obligations privées qui a connu un important développement au cours des dernières années.
L<U+0092>encours d<U+0092>actions cotées émises par les résidents de la zone euro s<U+0092>est établi à 4 035 milliards
d<U+0092>euros en 2004 contre 3 118 milliards en 2002.
• En tant que monnaie de règlement, le rôle de l<U+0092>euro s<U+0092>accroît. En 2003, entre 50 % et 60 % des
échanges de biens et services entre les pays de la zone euro et le reste du monde ont été réglés en
euros. Cela vaut à la fois pour les exportations et les importations. Dans les pays où l<U+0092>utilisation
de l<U+0092>euro comme moyen d<U+0092>échange est extrêmement importante, notamment dans les pays
d<U+0092>Europe centrale et orientale, 60 % à 80 % des importations et des exportations ont été réglées en
euros.
5
B/ L<U+0092>euro contribue à la stabilisation des régimes de change et des systèmes financiers.
L<U+0092>euro est un instrument de diversification des réserves de change
• Selon les données les plus récentes de la Banque des règlement internationaux (BRI), l<U+0092>euro est la
deuxième monnaie de réserve après le dollar des États-Unis (19,7 % du montant total en 2003
contre 63,8 % pour le dollar), mais sa part a fortement augmenté (12,6 % en 1999). Cette évolution
contribue à protéger de nombreux pays contre d<U+0092>importantes fluctuations de change en permettant
aux investisseurs publics de diversifier leurs avoirs de réserve. De plus, elle constitue un facteur de
stabilisation pour l<U+0092>ensemble du système monétaire et financier international.
L<U+0092>euro est un facteur de stabilité pour les régimes de change
• Dans 52 pays ou territoires, l<U+0092>euro sert de point d<U+0092>ancrage des politiques de change, ou
d<U+0092>unique monnaie de référence, ou fait partie d<U+0092>un panier de monnaies de référence. Il s<U+0092>agit
principalement des pays qui ont conclu des accords commerciaux ou institutionnels avec la zone
euro (nouveaux pays adhérents, pays candidats, Balkans, Afrique du Nord et zone franc). Ces
régimes de change sont le résultat de décisions unilatérales qui n<U+0092>engagent pas l<U+0092>Eurosystème.
Quoi qu<U+0092>il en soit, ces liens solides sont susceptibles d<U+0092>importer de la crédibilité dans ces pays,
dans la mesure des politiques appropriées sont suivies en parallèle.
CONCLUSION
• Si le rôle d<U+0092>une monnaie au plan interne est fortement déterminé par les institutions, c<U+0092>est le
marché qui préside à son rôle international. Cela explique pourquoi les différents usages de la
monnaie se développent à des rythmes différents.
• Le fait que de nombreux pays hors zone euro aient rapidement décidé de lier leur régime de
change à l<U+0092>euro tend à indiquer qu<U+0092>ils considèrent l<U+0092>euro comme un facteur de stabilité important
en raison du rôle stabilisateur qu<U+0092>il a joué, et joue encore, dans la zone euro.

Mesdames et Messieurs,
• C'est un grand plaisir pour moi d<U+0092>intervenir à l<U+0092>Université des Sciences Sociales de
Toulouse, un centre d<U+0092>excellence mondial de recherche en économie, pour vous parler de
l<U+0092>euro qui est l'une des réalisations les plus remarquables de l'Union européenne.
• La base juridique de la monnaie unique est le traité instituant la Communauté européenne,
dont l<U+0092>article 105 dispose :  « L<U+0092>objectif principal du SEBC est de maintenir la stabilité des
prix ». La stabilité des prix ainsi que la convergence des économies de la zone euro sont
des préalables indispensables pour que la monnaie unique soit capable d<U+0092>apporter
pleinement « son soutien aux politiques économiques générales dans la Communauté, en
vue de contribuer à la réalisation des objectifs de la Communauté, tels que définis à
l<U+0092>article 2 » du traité.
• Je voudrais tout d<U+0092>abord évoquer les fondements sur lesquels reposent la réussite de
l<U+0092>Euro, à savoir, en particulier, la politique monétaire unique, et la coopération
macroéconomique au sein de l<U+0092>Union économique et monétaire (Partie 1). J'aimerais,
ensuite, aborder brièvement l'intégration économique au sein de la zone euro : l'euro a
effectivement constitué un facteur puissant d'intégration économique et financière,
accentué aujourd'hui par son rôle international croissant (Partie 2). Enfin, je rappellerai
les défis auxquels l<U+0092>UEM, pour être un plein succès, doit faire face, à savoir, notamment,
la cohésion budgétaire, les réformes structurelles et l<U+0092>élargissement de l<U+0092>Union
(Partie 3).
PARTIE 1: LA RÉUSSITE DE L'EURO REPOSE SUR DES FONDEMENTS
SOLIDES
Il s<U+0092>agit de la politique monétaire unique (A), d'une part, qui a permis, grâce à un cadre
d<U+0092>action efficace et bien adapté, de réaliser d<U+0092>importantes avancées, et du bon
fonctionnement de la coopération macroéconomique de l'UEM (B), d'autre part.

A. Les réalisations de la politique monétaire unique
Depuis six ans, la politique monétaire unique conduite par l'Eurosystème, c'est-à-dire
l'ensemble constitué par la Banque centrale européenne et les douze banques centrales des
pays membres de la zone euro, a été couronnée par de nombreux succès. Le passage réussi à
l'euro, sous forme scripturale puis fiduciaire, constitue le premier d<U+0092>entre eux,
probablement le plus emblématique. Avant d<U+0092>être en place, la monnaie unique a longtemps
rencontré le scepticisme de nombreux observateurs qui estimaient peu réaliste de lancer une
nouvelle monnaie, dont le nom lui-même n'a été fixé qu'au Conseil européen de Madrid de
décembre 1995. D<U+0092>autres s<U+0092>interrogeaient quant à la possibilité d'envisager une politique
monétaire unique pour un ensemble de pays qui, en dépit de la rapidité de leur convergence,
n'en présentaient pas moins encore des disparités importantes. La perspective de la création
de nouvelles institutions, en particulier la Banque centrale européenne, a également été à
l'origine de très nombreux débats, dont les thèmes étaient centrés principalement autour du
cadre institutionnel et opérationnel (Al) et autour des stratégies (A2) d'une politique
monétaire unique. Aujourd'hui, nous pouvons évaluer ces réalisations (A3).
A.1. Un cadre institutionnel et opérationnel moderne
Le cadre institutionnel de l<U+0092>Eurosystème repose sur les principes d'indépendance, de
transparence et de responsabilité et, enfin, de décentralisation opérationnelle.
L<U+0092>Eurosystème bénéficie à cet égard de toute l<U+0092>expérience acquise par les banques centrales
nationales des pays membres.
A.1.1. L'indépendance de l'Eurosystème favorise la stabilité des prix
• Ainsi que l'ont montré de nombreux travaux empiriques, il n<U+0092>y aurait pas de corrélation
entre l<U+0092>indépendance de la banque centrale et la croissance ou la volatilité de l<U+0092>emploi. En
revanche, la performance anti-inflationniste d'une nation semble très fortement
corrélée au degré d'indépendance de sa banque centrale.
• Or, l'Eurosystème a pour mission principale, d'après le Traité de Maastricht, d'assurer et
de maintenir la stabilité des prix. L'indépendance de la Banque centrale européenne et
5
des douze banques centrales des pays membres de la zone euro est donc inscrite
dans le Traité.
• Au plan fonctionnel, cela signifie que, dans l'exercice de leur mission, ni la Banque
centrale européenne ni les banques centrales nationales de l'Eurosystème ne cherchent ni
ne prennent d'instruction des institutions communautaires, des gouvernements
nationaux ou d'une quelconque autre instance. Il s'agit là d'une pleine indépendance au
sens institutionnel et opérationnel.
A.1.2. La transparence et la responsabilité sont essentielles pour assurer la crédibilité
• Naturellement, l'indépendance de ces institutions a pour contrepartie la transparence
de leurs décisions et la responsabilité vis-à-vis du public et de ses représentants.
S'agissant d'institutions jeunes, comme la BCE, la transparence est encore plus essentielle
pour en asseoir la crédibilité et instaurer la confiance des agents économiques dans une
monnaie. Pour établir cette crédibilité, pour gagner cette confiance des agents, il est
absolument impératif d'être compris et pour cela, il est nécessaire d'être transparent.
• Les impératifs de responsabilité et de transparence sont inscrits dans le Traité en termes
très généraux. L<U+0092>Eurosystème est allé au-delà des strictes obligations institutionnelles
lui incombant, dans ces domaines :
- en premier lieu, le Conseil des Gouverneurs a précisé sa définition de la stabilité des
prix (hausse inférieure à, mais proche de, 2 % à moyen terme) ;
- en deuxième lieu, la BCE est allée au-delà des exigences de responsabilité établies par
le Traité en instituant des auditions régulières de son président devant le Parlement
européen et des réunions informelles régulières avec l'Eurogroupe des ministres des
Finances ;
- un autre signe de transparence réside dans la publication régulière de rapports sur les
évolutions économiques et les analyses de la Banque centrale, dont le Bulletin mensuel
de la BCE constitue le vecteur le plus connu ;
6
- enfin, point le plus important, à l'issue de chacune des réunions consacrées aux décisions
de politique monétaire, le président et le vice-président de la BCE tiennent une
conférence de presse suivie d'un échange ouvert avec les journalistes, dont le détail
est publié sur le site internet de la BCE. Il est important de rappeler que la BCE a été la
première des banques centrales à se soumettre à ce type d'exercice, qui fournit une
occasion unique d'expliquer et de commenter les décisions de politique monétaire,
immédiatement et de façon détaillée.
• En revanche, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a choisi de ne pas publier les
procès-verbaux de ses réunions. En effet, la publication des procès-verbaux présente
certains inconvénients :
- tout d'abord, lorsqu'ils sont très détaillés, les participants risquent de « parler pour le
procès-verbal », alors que, lorsqu'ils ne sont pas détaillés, ils ne présentent guère plus
d'intérêt qu'un simple communiqué ;
- ensuite, ils peuvent compliquer l'évolution des prises de position de ses membres à la
lumière des arguments développés ;
- enfin, ce qui est le plus important, dans le cas de la zone euro, l'analyse des votes
pourrait être lue et interprétée à la lumière de préoccupations ou d'intérêts
nationaux, ce qui serait fallacieux et pourrait menacer à la fois l'indépendance des
membres du Conseil des gouverneurs et la crédibilité de nos processus de prise de
décision.
A.1.3. L'Eurosystème repose sur la décentralisation opérationnelle
• Le troisième élément, la décentralisation opérationnelle, constitue une
caractéristique essentielle de l'Eurosystème. La répartition des rôles entre la BCE et les
banques centrales nationales constitue l'un des éléments de sa cohésion et son moteur
principal. Selon ce principe, les décisions de politique monétaire sont prises de façon
centralisée, par le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, mais mises en <U+009C>uvre par les
banques centrales nationales.
7
• Un point essentiel, c<U+0092>est que ce sont les banques centrales nationales <U+0096>à l<U+0092>exclusion de
la BCE<U+0096> qui tiennent les comptes des banques commerciales, et donc sont en mesure
d<U+0092>assurer leur refinancement et la cohésion des systèmes de règlement nationaux.
L'utilisation de technologies et de moyens de communication modernes a permis de
réaliser les opérations de marché de façon simultanée dans toutes les banques centrales
nationales, au lieu de les concentrer en un point géographique donné et de concilier ainsi
parfaitement décentralisation des opérations et unité du marché monétaire de la zone euro.
Le même dispositif s'applique à d'autres domaines monétaires (gestion de trésorerie,
systèmes de paiement, etc.).
A.1.4. L'Eurosystème bénéficie d'un cadre opérationnel efficient
A côté de ce cadre institutionnel moderne, l'Eurosystème bénéficie également d'un dispositif
opérationnel particulièrement efficient, qui repose sur deux composantes :
<U+0096> une gamme cohérente d'instruments de politique monétaire, élaborée selon les
principes de libre concurrence, d'égalité de traitement, de simplicité et de
transparence : ces instruments doivent permettre l<U+0092>ajustement de la liquidité bancaire et le
pilotage efficace des taux d'intérêt en toutes circonstances ;
<U+0096> des procédures garantissant un niveau élevé de sécurité pour l'ensemble des
transactions interbancaires et des paiements de montant élevé au sein de la zone euro
et avec d'autres pays de l'Union économique, en particulier le système Target, dont le
rôle a été déterminant dans le processus d'intégration du marché monétaire en euros.
A.2. Le cadre stratégique
L<U+0092>efficacité de la politique monétaire unique repose également sur son cadre stratégique,
lequel peut être caractérisé par deux éléments principaux : une définition quantitative de la
stabilité des prix et une orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire.
8
A.2.1. Une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix
• La définition retenue par le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE en octobre 1998 a
été confirmée et précisée en mai 2003, à l'issue d'un examen approfondi de son cadre
stratégique. Au terme de cet exercice d'évaluation, le Conseil des gouverneurs a précisé
que la stabilité des prix était définie par une croissance annuelle de l'IPCH proche de, mais
inférieure à, 2 % à moyen terme.
• Cette définition appelle plusieurs commentaires :
<U+0096> en précisant que l'inflation devait être proche de 2 %, le Conseil des gouverneurs a tout
d'abord tenu à confirmer le caractère symétrique de sa stratégie en excluant les
situations de déflation. Cette précision permet également la prise en compte d'éventuels
biais de mesure sur l'indice des prix, ainsi que des écarts d'inflation au sein de la zone
euro ;
<U+0096> la définition quantitative de la stabilité monétaire rapproche le cadre stratégique de
l'Eurosystème de celui des banques centrales reposant sur un ciblage de l'inflation,
en particulier lorsque l'on considère une acception large de ce dernier, telle que celle
présentée sous le terme de « cible d'inflation flexible ». La grande différence repose sur le
rôle des prévisions issues d'un modèle économétrique, qui jouent un rôle prépondérant
dans les stratégies « pures » de ciblage de l'inflation, alors qu'elles ne sont qu'un élément
dans le processus de décision du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE.
A.2.2. Une orientation « à moyen terme »
Quelles sont précisément les implications de cette orientation à moyen terme de la stratégie de
politique monétaire de la BCE ?
• La première est que la stratégie de politique monétaire unique n'a pas un horizon
fixe, déterminé une fois pour toutes ex ante, mais vise, dans la mesure du possible, à
tenir compte des « délais longs et variables de la politique monétaire » chers à Milton
Friedman. La prise en compte de cette incertitude est particulièrement importante dans le
cas de la zone euro, dont on ignore pour partie les « paramètres structurels profonds ».
9
Plus prosaïquement, cette orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire unique
reconnaît qu'il est impossible, pour une banque centrale, de contrôler avec exactitude la
trajectoire des prix à très court terme.
• La seconde implication est que les indicateurs pertinents pour la politique monétaire
doivent refléter, de façon quasi-exhaustive, les principaux facteurs à l'origine de
l'inflation à court comme à long terme. De ce point de vue, la stratégie de politique
monétaire cherche, autant que faire se peut, à mobiliser une « information complète ».
C'est ce que traduisent les notions d'approche économique et d'approche monétaire
(que l'on qualifie également d'approche en deux piliers) qui sont reprises notamment lors
des conférences de presse du président de la BCE à la suite des décisions de politique
monétaire. L'approche économique passe en revue les indicateurs conjoncturels,
économiques et financiers en rapport avec les principaux déterminants de l'inflation à
court terme ; l'approche monétaire repose quant à elle sur l'explication monétaire de
l'inflation à long terme. L'orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire unique
rend nécessaire l'articulation de ces deux approches complémentaires du phénomène
inflationniste. En cela, la stratégie de politique monétaire de la BCE est plus englobante
que les stratégies de pur ciblage d'inflation ou de pur ciblage monétaire.
A.3. Les réalisations de la politique monétaire de la BCE
Quel premier bilan peut-on dresser après ces six premières années de mise en <U+009C>uvre de la
politique monétaire unique ?
• Je voudrais souligner trois points essentiels :
- Premièrement, la réalisation des objectifs de politique monétaire. Alors qu'elle a été
confrontée à une série de chocs défavorables (sur les prix du pétrole, les produits
alimentaires, le prix des services, les prix administrés et la fiscalité indirecte), conduisant à
une évolution de l'IPCH supérieure à 2 % en glissement annuel de 2000 à 2002 et en
2004, la politique monétaire unique est parvenue à stabiliser et ancrer, sur la totalité de la
période d'exercice, les anticipations d'inflation à moyen - long terme autour de 1,8 à
1,9 %. Cela représente un niveau proche de, mais inférieur à, 2 % conformément à sa
définition de la stabilité des prix ainsi que le montrent par exemple les anticipations
d'inflation issues des enquêtes (par exemple, Consensus Forecast, ou l'enquête de la
10
BCE auprès des prévisionnistes professionnels). Les conditions de financement, qui
reflètent notamment le bas niveau des taux d'intérêt à court comme à long terme dans la
zone euro, sont restées particulièrement favorables. Ces bons résultats illustrent la
crédibilité de la politique monétaire unique.
- Deuxièmement, la compréhension et la prévisibilité des actions de politique
monétaire. Contrairement à certaines idées reçues, la plupart des décisions de politique
monétaire ont été parfaitement anticipées par les marchés. Ce diagnostic provient des
études conduites par l'Eurosystème mais également des rapports publiés par les « ECB
Watchers », avec lesquels, d'ailleurs, la BCE entretient des liens réguliers, notamment
sous forme de conférences annuelles. Une comparaison avec la Fed ne montre d'ailleurs
pas de réelle différence entre les deux institutions quant à la capacité des marchés à
anticiper les décisions de politique monétaire. C'est le signe de la transparence de la
politique monétaire unique. Le fait, notamment, que la BCE ait choisi d'autres moyens
de communication que la publication des procès-verbaux des réunions du Conseil des
gouverneurs ne l'a pas empêchée d'atteindre un niveau élevé de compréhension et de
prévisibilité.
- Troisièmement, la confiance et l'approbation des citoyens européens. Effectivement,
l'euro s'est aisément imposé auprès des agents économiques et fait désormais partie du
quotidien des consommateurs européens. Et les enquêtes confirment que le public a
confiance en l'euro, qu'il considère comme une monnaie solide, et dans l'Eurosystème en
tant que banque centrale.
• Il reste cependant deux facteurs de préoccupation :
- le premier réside dans la difficulté naturelle à évoluer vers un référentiel de prix
entièrement nouveau-et il peut s'écouler de nombreuses années avant que l'ensemble
des agents économiques l'ait complètement intégré ;
- le second facteur est la perception de hausses de prix excessives par les
consommateurs, liée au passage à l'euro fiduciaire. En effet, l'attention du public
s'est concentrée sur un petit nombre de biens et de services qui ont subi des hausses
anormales de prix lors de cet événement, ce qui a conduit à une perception erronée du
taux réel d'inflation. Ce décalage entre l'inflation perçue et l'inflation effective est
heureusement en voie de résorption progressive.
11
B. Les procédures de surveillance multilatérale au sein de l'UEM
Dans l'UEM, où coexistent une politique monétaire unique et douze gouvernements
responsables des politiques budgétaires et des politiques structurelles, un cadre institutionnel
approprié est indispensable pour assurer une cohérence d<U+0092>ensemble. C<U+0092>est notamment l<U+0092>objet
du Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance qui précise et complète les dispositions du Traité en la
matière. Pour que ce cadre soit pleinement opérationnel, il doit être simple, facile à mettre en
<U+009C>uvre et capable d'assurer des politiques budgétaires saines et soutenables. C<U+0092>est ainsi que les
processus de surveillance multilatérale ont été conçus dès l'origine, afin d'atteindre un
niveau de cohésion satisfaisant dans les politiques suivies par tous les États membres.
B.1. Un cadre de procédures de surveillance multilatérale
• La mise en <U+009C>uvre de la surveillance est confiée à l'Eurogroupe (réunion informelle
des ministres des Finances des pays de la zone euro) et au Conseil Ecofin (réunion
des ministres des Finances de tous les pays de l'UE, ayant pouvoir décisionnel),
conjointement avec la Commission européenne. La surveillance mutuelle combine les
procédures multilatérales de surveillance et de dialogue, le respect de règles et de
dispositions communes, et l'engagement des États membres à respecter les bonnes
pratiques et les objectifs communs. La construction européenne est un projet en évolution
constante et chaque réunion du Conseil européen a donné lieu, dans un passé récent, à des
processus qui ont pris le nom des endroits où les sommets se tenaient. Cela s'applique à
des processus relatifs à des domaines tels que les marchés du travail (processus de
Luxembourg), la réforme économique des marchés des biens et des capitaux (processus de
Cardiff) et le dialogue macroéconomique visant à promouvoir des évolutions salariales
responsables (processus de Cologne).
• Les programmes de stabilité (pour les Etats membres de la zone euro) et de
convergence (pour les Etats membres hors zone euro)  permettent  d<U+0092>examiner les
politiques budgétaires nationales au niveau de la Communauté dans une perspective à
moyen terme et d<U+0092>apprécier leur conformité aux dispositions du Pacte de Stabilité et de
Croissance. Au centre du processus de coordination se trouvent les Grandes orientations
de politique économique (GOPE), qui contiennent une évaluation à moyen terme de
l'état de convergence des politiques économiques nationales. Les GOPE jouent un rôle
12
crucial car tous les processus de coordination mentionnés précédemment doivent être
compatibles avec leurs recommandations. Les mises à jour des programmes et des GOPE
sont présentées sur une base pluriannuelle et leur mise en <U+009C>uvre est examinée chaque
année.
B.2. Les nouveaux États membres respectent les mêmes règles
Laissez-moi souligner le fait que les dix nouveaux États membres sont déjà habitués aux
processus d'examen mutuel. Depuis leur adhésion, le 1er mai 2004, la politique budgétaire des
dix nouveaux États membres a été soumise aux mêmes mesures d'examen que celle des autres
États membres. Les déficits budgétaires constituent une préoccupation essentielle pour les
nouveaux pays de l'UE. L'adoption à terme de l'euro étant subordonnée au respect du
critère de déficit budgétaire au sens de Maastricht, ces pays sont maintenant contraints
d'entreprendre des réformes budgétaires substantielles, d'autant plus que leurs déficits
proviennent en grande partie d'insuffisances structurelles.
PARTIE 2 : L'EURO : UN MOTEUR PUISSANT POUR UNE PLUS GRANDE
INTÉGRATION ÉCONOMIQUE ET FINANCIÈRE ET UNE RECONNAISSANCE
INTERNATIONALE
Le renforcement du cadre opérationnel et institutionnel va de pair avec une convergence
croissante au sein de la zone monétaire (A) et avec le renforcement du rôle de l'euro au
niveau international (B).
A. Les piliers d'une zone monétaire optimale
La convergence croissante résulte de la solidité des fondamentaux macroéconomiques (Al)
et de l'homogénéité économique (A2), renforcées par l'intégration du secteur financier
(A3).
L'adoption d'une même monnaie par onze, puis douze pays européens constitue un fait sans
précédent. Cette adoption n<U+0092>a été possible que grâce à la convergence croissante des
économies en question au cours des années quatre-vingt-dix. S'il semble abusif de considérer
la zone euro comme une zone monétaire optimale, au sens où l'entendait Robert Mundell,
13
plusieurs travaux récents ont cependant montré que le processus de convergence,
l'homogénéité économique, le degré de synchronisation des cycles d'activité et la propension
des économies de la zone à échanger entre elles se sont accrus depuis la mise en <U+009C>uvre de
la politique monétaire unique. Cette dernière, en réussissant également à ancrer, dans la
totalité des pays membres, les anticipations d'inflation à un faible niveau s'est montrée
capable d'imposer un important degré de convergence nominale. Enfin, l'Union économique et
monétaire a mis ses membres à l'abri des crises de change et des déséquilibres
macroéconomiques qui les affectaient de manière assez fréquente, il y a encore un peu
plus d'une dizaine d'années.
A.l. La zone euro se caractérise par des fondamentaux économiques solides
• Les économies de la zone euro se caractérisent, actuellement, par un important
degré de convergence structurelle, un faible niveau d'inflation, proche de 2 %, et
des conditions monétaires et financières favorables à l'activité économique. Ces
conditions de financement favorables s'expliquent également par la bonne capacité de
résistance des systèmes financiers et bancaires de la zone euro aux divers chocs ayant
affecté l'économie mondiale : solidité des infrastructures, bonnes performances des
banques et institutions financières, progrès accomplis dans la conformité aux normes
internationales. L'épargne privée y est également abondante.
• En outre, la zone euro est une économie attractive du fait de la qualité de sa main-
d'<U+009C>uvre (près de 5 % du PIB y est, par exemple, consacré aux dépenses d'éducation) et
de ses infrastructures.
• Ces différents atouts lui ont permis de drainer 67 milliards d'euros d'investissement
direct en 2004.
A.2. L'homogénéité économique croissante favorise la transmission de la politique
monétaire
Si l'Union monétaire n'implique pas nécessairement que tous les États membres affichent, à
tout moment, le même taux de croissance ou d'inflation, un certain nombre de travaux
empiriques récents illustrent une homogénéité économique croissante au sein de la zone euro.
14
• En termes d'activité tout d'abord, plusieurs travaux présentés sous l'égide d'un groupe
de travail commun entre le CEPR (Centre for Economic Policy Research) et
l'Eurosystème montrent que la corrélation entre les fluctuations cycliques de l'activité
économique dans son ensemble dans la plupart des pays de la zone euro, déjà forte
avant la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire unique, s'est accrue depuis 1999.
Il en est de même pour la consommation et l<U+0092>investissement. Selon certaines mesures,
une composante «européenne» commune jouerait un rôle plus important que les
composantes nationales dans les fluctuations cycliques de l'activité dans la plupart de ces
économies. Le degré de corrélation entre cycles nationaux et cycle agrégé au niveau de la
zone euro varierait ainsi dans un intervalle compris entre 0,70 et 0,92.
• En termes d'inflation, selon les travaux menés par l<U+0092>Eurosystème, le degré de
dispersion des rythmes d'inflation au sein de la zone euro ne serait pas nettement
supérieur à celui que l'on observe aux États-Unis où existent des forces de rappel
bien plus fortes que dans la zone euro - telles que la présence d'un budget fédéral unique
équilibrant les différences cycliques entre régions, des marchés des biens et services et du
travail plus unifiés, une politique monétaire unique depuis 1913. Ainsi, sur ces premières
années d'existence de l'UEM, l'écart-type du glissement annuel des prix dans les douze
pays de la zone euro serait, selon les estimations, proche de 1 point contre 0,8 point pour
les quatorze zones métropolitaines des États-Unis.
• Enfin, les mises à jour récentes de l'important travail de recherche effectué par
l'Eurosystème sur les mécanismes de transmission de la politique monétaire unique
tendent à indiquer une homogénéité croissante des réponses des économies des pays
membres aux impulsions de la politique monétaire. Notamment, l<U+0092>écart-type des délais
d<U+0092>ajustement des taux débiteurs aux variations du taux directeur aurait, en moyenne,
diminué de moitié depuis la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire unique.
A.3. L'intégration du secteur financier est presque achevée
L'introduction de l'euro a agi comme un catalyseur de l'intégration financière :
15
- cette dernière est quasiment achevée en ce qui concerne le marché monétaire de
l'euro. Dès les premières semaines de la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la politique monétaire
unique, les différences de prix constatées sur les marchés interbancaires nationaux se
sont estompées très rapidement pour devenir inférieures à 5 points de base, ce qui
correspond au spread bid-ask habituellement observé sur ce marché ;
- un mouvement d'intégration comparable s'est également produit sur les marchés
obligataires européens, où l'on a pu constater un resserrement des rendements des
titres d'État, ainsi que sur les marchés dérivés avec l'impressionnant développement
d'Eurex et de Liffe et, dans une moindre mesure, sur les marchés boursiers et le marché
des émissions de titres de dette pour les entreprises ;
- la zone euro et, plus largement, l'Union européenne disposent à présent d'une
architecture financière cohérente. Tout d'abord, la mise en <U+009C>uvre du Plan d'Action
pour les Services Financiers, défini au Conseil européen de Lisbonne en mars 2000, est en
cours d'achèvement. Ensuite, le « processus Lamfalussy » devrait favoriser la mise en
place d'une nouvelle architecture institutionnelle dans le domaine de la supervision et de la
réglementation du secteur financier <U+0096> c'est-à-dire des marchés de titres mais également des
banques et des assurances <U+0096> en développant notamment des règles techniques plus
flexibles et plus uniformes.
B. L'euro joue désormais le rôle de monnaie internationale et d'ancrage nominal
Les données disponibles confirment le rôle croissant de l'euro au niveau international. Au
niveau régional, il joue un rôle d'ancrage de premier plan, ce qui en fait le précieux vecteur
d'une culture de stabilité.
Le rôle croissant de l'euro à l'échelle internationale résulte du développement à la fois de son
utilisation au niveau privé (B1) et de son rôle officiel (B2). L<U+0092>Eurosystème observe
cependant une position de neutralité vis-à-vis du développement externe de sa monnaie
(B3).
B.1. L'évolution de l'utilisation privée de l'euro
16
L'euro possède les fonctions-clés que l'on attribue à toute monnaie internationale : il s'agit
déjà d'une monnaie de placement et de financement de premier plan et d'un intermédiaire
important des échanges internationaux. Même s'il est encore limité, son rôle de monnaie de
facturation devrait se développer dans les années à venir.
B.1.1. Un instrument financier essentiel au niveau mondial
• L'utilisation de l'euro en tant que monnaie de placement et de financement sur les
marchés internationaux de capitaux s'est développée de façon immédiate. Entre mi-
2003 et mi-2004, il a représenté 33 % des émissions nettes de titres de créance
internationaux2, contre 20 % en 1998. A la mi-2004, près de 31 % de l'encours de titres de
créance internationaux3 étaient libellés en euros, contre une part inférieure à 20 % en 1998.
• Un autre développement très remarquable est l'émergence d'un marché de titres
« corporate », c'est-à-dire de titres émis par des entreprises, dont le volume a crû
significativement au cours des premières années de l'euro.
• La meilleure allocation de l'épargne en Europe nécessite que les marchés de capitaux
soient plus efficients et davantage intégrés. Or, cette intégration n'est pas encore
totalement achevée, notamment en ce qui concerne les marchés des pensions, des dépôts et
des titres.
• La zone euro présente toutefois un certain retard en matière de marché-actions. Selon
les données de la BRI, la capitalisation boursière de la zone euro ne représentait que
16,1 % de la capitalisation boursière mondiale contre 48,5 % pour les États-Unis. Mais
l<U+0092>euro a favorisé une tendance au regroupement des places financières européennes déjà en
place.
B.1.2. Un important intermédiaire des échanges
                                                          
2 Selon une définition étroite, c<U+0092>est-à-dire n<U+0092>incluant pas les émissions internationales en euro par des résidents de la zone euro.
3 Selon la même définition.
17
En tant qu'intermédiaire des échanges, l'euro était impliqué en 2004 dans 37 % des opérations
de change, contre 88 % pour le dollar. Cependant, la part de l'euro est supérieure à la somme
des parts des anciennes monnaies nationales européennes. Ce résultat n'était pas évident au
moment de l'introduction de l'euro.
• Un rôle croissant de monnaie de facturation/règlement :
- s'agissant de l'utilisation de la monnaie européenne dans le commerce international,
entre 50 % et 60 % des échanges commerciaux de la quasi-totalité des pays de la zone
euro avec le reste du monde étaient libellés en euros en 2003. Cela vaut à la fois pour les
exportations et les importations. S'agissant du commerce des pays de l'UE avec les pays
tiers, 54% des exportations japonaises vers l'Union européenne ont été facturées ou réglées
en euros en 2002 (44 % en 2000) et 31 % des importations japonaises en provenance de
l'Union européenne ont été libellées en euros (contre 17 % en 2000) ;
- dans les pays non membres de la zone mais où l'intégration avec la zone euro est très
élevée, comme les nouveaux Etats membres d'Europe centrale et orientale, l'utilisation
de l'euro dans les échanges est également très marquée, 40 % à 80 % des
exportations/importations étant facturées ou réglées en euros.
• En revanche, l'utilisation de la monnaie unique est plus limitée sur les marchés de
matières premières, notamment du pétrole. Le dollar y joue encore un rôle prépondérant,
qui devrait perdurer, compte tenu des phénomènes d'inertie liés aux effets de « réseau ».
Cela n'est pas surprenant dans la mesure où l'acquisition d'un statut international
constitue, à tous les égards, un processus long.
Au total, ces évolutions soulignent le fait que l'euro a su inspirer confiance aux investisseurs
privés et favoriser une plus grande liquidité des marchés de capitaux.
B.2. Le rôle officiel croissant de l'euro
La demande croissante en faveur de l'euro comme monnaie de réserve et de référence a
également renforcé son rôle officiel.
                                                          
4 Les transactions de change impliquant toujours deux monnaies, la somme des parts des monnaies est égale à 200 %.
18
B.2.1. Un facteur de diversification des réserves de change
L'euro est devenu un facteur stabilisateur du système monétaire international tout
particulièrement grâce à sa fonction de diversification des réserves internationales.
• Selon les dernières données disponibles du FMI, l'euro était la deuxième monnaie de
réserve après le dollar en 2003. L<U+0092>euro en représente actuellement 19,7 % contre 63,8 %
pour le dollar. La part de l<U+0092>euro s<U+0092>est accrue : elle n<U+0092>était que de 12,6 % en 1999. Cette
tendance offre à de nombreux pays un précieux volant de sécurité contre de fortes
fluctuations des changes, dans la mesure où les investisseurs publics peuvent diversifier
leurs avoirs de réserve.
• Plusieurs banques centrales de pays émergents (européens, Moyen-Orient et surtout
asiatiques)5 ont récemment annoncé leur volonté d<U+0092>accroître la part de l<U+0092>euro dans leurs
réserves. Ce phénomène est d'autant plus important que le poids relatif de l<U+0092>Asie dans les
réserves de change internationales est élevé (66 % en incluant l<U+0092>Inde).
B.2.2. Un facteur de stabilité pour de nombreux régimes de change
• Loin d'être la simple addition des monnaies européennes précédentes, l'euro a hérité
des caractéristiques les plus remarquables des anciennes monnaies nationales. Les
effets positifs en ont été notables. L'euro a créé un environnement de taux d'intérêt
historiquement bas. En outre, il a mis un terme aux crises de changes intra-européennes.
Même si ces deux éléments sont parfois oubliés, il est intéressant de remarquer que
l'Europe n'a pas connu de tumulte à la suite, par exemple, des incertitudes créées par les
récentes tensions géopolitiques au plan mondial, qui auraient provoqué, dans le passé, de
vives turbulences.
• Ces avantages sont peut-être encore plus précieux pour les pays voisins, puisque 50
d'entre eux (dont ceux de la zone franc) ont déjà adopté l'euro comme monnaie de
                                                          
5 Ex : Russie, Ukraine, Corée, Japon, Chine, pays de l<U+0092>OPEP.

référence pour leurs régimes de change, soit comme ancre unique (dans 30 cas environ),
soit comme composante d'un panier de monnaies.
• L'utilisation de l'euro dans les régimes de change des pays tiers concerne
essentiellement des régions qui ont tissé des liens étroits avec la zone euro ou qui
ont mis en place des arrangements institutionnels spéciaux avec l'UE (pays adhérents
et candidats, Balkans, Afrique du nord et zone franc). Dans tous les cas, ces régimes de
change résultent d'une décision unilatérale, qui n'implique aucun engagement de la
part de l'Eurosystème. Cependant, des liens étroits avec l'euro peuvent présenter
l<U+0092>avantage, pour ces pays, d'« importer » de la crédibilité, à condition de poursuivre
simultanément des politiques appropriées.
• En ce qui concerne les dix nouveaux pays de l'UE, laissez-moi souligner que le
critère de stabilité des taux de change au sein du MCE II nécessite que cette stabilité
soit atteinte avant l'adoption de la monnaie unique. L'avantage est que l'adoption
de l'euro sera le couronnement d'un processus de convergence structuré au sein d'un
cadre multilatéral. C'est assurément l'un des défis les plus importants auxquels devra faire
face la zone euro dans les années à venir.
B.3. La position de l<U+0092>Eurosystème sur le développement du rôle international de l<U+0092>euro
• L<U+0092>Eurosystème observe une position officielle de neutralité vis-à-vis du développement
externe de sa monnaie, ce qui signifie qu<U+0092>il ne promeut ni n<U+0092>empêche le développement
du rôle international de l<U+0092>euro, car il considère que c<U+0092>est un processus essentiellement
conduit par les marchés.
• En outre, l<U+0092>Eurosystème est conscient de la nécessité d<U+0092>éviter des évolutions trop brutales,
qui pourraient entraîner une volatilité excessive ou des mésalignements des taux de
change.
• En fait, la conduite d<U+0092>une politique monétaire orientée vers le maintien de la stabilité des
prix est la meilleure contribution que l<U+0092>Eurosystème puisse apporter au développement
20
international de sa monnaie, car elle favorise la confiance dans la valeur de l<U+0092>euro et
renforce la crédibilité de la zone.
PARTIE 3 : LES DÉFIS DE LA MONNAIE UNIQUE
L'environnement dans lequel évolue l'euro étant en mutation continue, les pouvoirs publics
doivent faire face à de nouveaux défis lorsqu'ils formulent et mettent en <U+009C>uvre leurs décisions
de politique économique. Je voudrais attirer l'attention sur trois de ces défis qui, à mon avis,
pèseront fortement sur l'avenir de l'euro et de la construction européenne.
En premier lieu, il est nécessaire de renforcer la coordination budgétaire de l'UE afin de
consolider les fondements sur lesquels repose l'euro (A), dans une période où les
politiques budgétaires en Europe doivent faire face à des défis spécifiques tels que le
vieillissement de la population.
En deuxième lieu, il est nécessaire de mettre en <U+009C>uvre des réformes structurelles (B) afin de
mieux préparer les pays à affronter les défis à venir.
Enfin, le processus d'élargissement (C), qui est certes déjà une réalité, demandera des efforts
supplémentaires pour que les nouveaux États membres progressent encore et finissent par
rattraper leur retard.
A. La nécessité d'un renforcement de la cohésion et de la coordination budgétaires
au sein de l'Union
• Le respect des règles et des procédures formulées dans le Traité et des dispositions
du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance imposent la même discipline budgétaire à
tous les États membres : le déficit budgétaire ne doit pas excéder le plafond de 3 % du
PIB et le ratio d'endettement total ne devrait pas dépasser 60 % du PIB. Ces limites
contribuent à assurer un policy-mix optimal au niveau de la zone euro, dans la mesure où
une politique budgétaire laxiste risque, à terme, de compromettre la réalisation de la
stabilité des prix. Enfin, elles entretiennent une croissance et un emploi durables et sont
propices à la stabilité économique.
21
• La discipline budgétaire est en effet d'une importance capitale pour l'UEM, car elle
est un corollaire nécessaire de la politique monétaire unique. On attend des États membres
qu'ils considèrent leurs politiques économiques comme des questions « d'intérêt
commun », étant donné l'incidence que leurs décisions budgétaires peuvent avoir sur la
zone euro dans son ensemble. Dans une union monétaire, il est de la plus grande
importance d<U+0092>éviter les « comportements de passager clandestin », d'où la clause
de « non-renflouement » inscrite dans le Traité de Maastricht.
• Le cadre institutionnel de la coordination des politiques économiques nationales a bien
fonctionné dans le passé, en laissant une marge de man<U+009C>uvre suffisante pour faire face à
un ralentissement de la croissance. Conformément au concept d'équilibre des soldes
budgétaires structurels, les États membres de l'UE se sont engagés à atteindre et à
maintenir, au cours du cycle économique, une situation budgétaire « proche de
l'équilibre ou excédentaire ». Cette exigence doit permettre de faire face aux chocs
asymétriques et aux fluctuations conjoncturelles, tout en laissant les stabilisateurs
automatiques exercer pleinement leurs effets. Cette flexibilité est essentielle pour
surmonter les chocs asymétriques tout en préservant la soutenabilité à long terme des
finances publiques et l'autonomie de la politique monétaire.
• Cependant, les difficultés auxquelles se sont heurtés de nombreux pays européens ont
suscité de vives critiques à l<U+0092>encontre des dispositions budgétaires du Traité et du Pacte
de stabilité et de croissance. Dans ce contexte, la Commission européenne a présenté en
septembre dernier des propositions de réforme ; les discussions en Conseil des Ministres
ont finalement abouti en mars et l<U+0092>accord sur cette réforme, qui vise à modifier les
modalités de la mise en <U+009C>uvre du Pacte, a été entériné lors du Conseil européen des 22-23
mars dernier.  Ces modifications portent principalement sur deux aspects : le volet
préventif et le volet correctif du Pacte :
<U+0096> Sur le volet préventif, la modification la plus intéressante a consisté à rechercher une
application plus symétrique du Pacte, en période de basse et de haute conjoncture, en
incitant les Etats membres à renforcer la mise en <U+009C>uvre d'une politique budgétaire
saine en période de haute conjoncture. Lorsque la croissance est forte, les pays doivent
se mobiliser encore davantage pour réduire leurs déficits ou dégager des excédents et
réduire ainsi l'encours d'une dette publique, souvent à des niveaux élevés. Cela signifie
22
qu'en période de conjoncture favorable, il faut adopter des politiques budgétaires moins
laxistes pour garantir la soutenabilité à long terme des finances publiques. En revanche
d<U+0092>autres modifications, comme la différenciation par pays de l<U+0092>objectif de moyen terme,
ou la prise en compte de l<U+0092>impact de réformes structurelles -par exemple des régimes de
retraites- sont discutables, notamment parce qu<U+0092>elles sont susceptibles d<U+0092>accroître la
complexité du Pacte et d<U+0092>atténuer l<U+0092>efficacité du volet préventif.
<U+0096> Sur le volet correctif (c<U+0092>est-à-dire concernant la mise en <U+009C>uvre de la procédure pour
déficit excessif à l<U+0092>égard d<U+0092>un Etat membre ne respectant pas les valeurs de référence de
3% et 60%), les modifications introduites aboutissent clairement à un assouplissement du
Pacte. On peut citer par exemple, la nouvelle définition des « circonstances
exceptionnelles et temporaires », qui permet d<U+0092>éviter le déclenchement de la procédure
pour déficit excessif dès lors que le taux de croissance est négatif ou très faible par
rapport au potentiel. Il faut également noter la définition d<U+0092>une liste de « facteurs
pertinents » -dont il est tenu compte pour apprécier le dépassement du déficit public au-
delà de la valeur de référence de 3 % du PIB- qui comporte notamment les dépenses de
recherche et développement, l<U+0092>aide public au développement ainsi que les dépenses liées
à la réforme des systèmes de retraite ou l<U+0092>unification de l<U+0092>Europe. Enfin, il faut souligner
un allongement général des délais accordés aux Etats pour la correction du déficit
excessif.
• A la suite de cet accord du Conseil des Ministres sur l<U+0092>amélioration de la mise en <U+009C>uvre
du Pacte, le Conseil des Gouverneurs de la BCE s<U+0092>est exprimé publiquement pour
exprimer ses préoccupations. Il a rappelé que des politiques budgétaires saines et une
politique monétaire axée sur la stabilité des prix sont essentielles pour le succès de l<U+0092>Union
économique et monétaire. Elles constituent des conditions indispensables à la stabilité
macroéconomique, à la croissance et à la cohésion dans la zone euro. Le Conseil des
Gouverneurs de la BCE a insisté sur le fait qu<U+0092>il est impératif que les États membres, la
Commission européenne et le Conseil de l<U+0092>Union européenne mettent en <U+009C>uvre le cadre
révisé d<U+0092>une manière rigoureuse et cohérente, propice à la conduite de politiques
budgétaires prudentes.
Le respect de l'objectif central d'équilibre budgétaire reste d'autant plus
indispensable que l'Union européenne devra s'atteler au problème du vieillissement
23
rapide de la population, dont les implications sur les finances publiques sont
considérables, tant sous l'angle des dépenses de santé que des régimes de retraite. Étant
donné que, dans ces domaines, les réformes risquent de n'être perceptibles qu'à moyen et
long termes, il est essentiel que les pays européens prennent toutes les dispositions
nécessaires pour prévenir les conséquences de ces évolutions démographiques, notamment sur
le plan budgétaire.
• La mise en <U+009C>uvre de politiques budgétaires saines passe également par
l'amélioration de la qualité des dépenses publiques. Un premier pas dans cette
direction consisterait à faire porter le processus d'ajustement sur les dépenses courantes
plutôt que sur l'investissement, à la différence de ce qui a été fait dans la plupart des pays
à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix. De manière plus générale, les pays de l<U+0092>UE doivent
entreprendre des réformes structurelles visant à renforcer le potentiel de croissance et à
favoriser la création d'emplois. Sur ces points, l'Eurosystème a appelé ces pays à maintes
reprises et sans ambiguïté possible à procéder à ces réformes.
B. Des réformes structurelles doivent être accomplies dans plusieurs domaines
Il subsiste néanmoins en Europe, en particulier dans la zone euro, d'importantes rigidités
structurelles qu'il s'agit de résoudre si l'on souhaite promouvoir la plus forte croissance non
inflationniste possible. Je souhaiterais ici évoquer plusieurs pistes qui font d'ailleurs l'objet
d'un consensus au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs de la zone euro. Elles portent notamment
sur les efforts à poursuivre en ce qui concerne le rôle et l'importance de la recherche (B1)
pour accroître le potentiel de croissance de la zone euro, le développement des « forces
d'agglomération » pour faciliter la localisation des entreprises (B2), les efforts à accomplir
enfin pour accroître la flexibilité sur le marché du travail (B3) et l'intégration des marchés
des biens et services (B4).
B.1. Une économie fondée sur la connaissance
S'agissant du premier point, la stratégie adoptée à l'unanimité lors du Conseil européen de
Lisbonne en mars 2000, qui a pour objectif de faire de l'Union européenne « l'économie de la
connaissance la plus compétitive et la plus dynamique du monde, capable d'une croissance
économique durable accompagnée d'une amélioration qualitative et quantitative de l'emploi
24
et d'une plus grande cohésion sociale », fournit un cadre de référence pour guider l'action
publique. Elle insiste notamment sur l'importance de la recherche, de l'innovation et de la
diffusion des technologies nouvelles pour élever le niveau de productivité de l'économie. Elle
vise également à donner à l'économie européenne ainsi qu'à tous les pays membres de l'UE
plus de souplesse, plus d'activité, et plus d'emplois. Il s'agit d'une stratégie certes ambitieuse
mais cruciale pour l'avenir de l'Europe et de la zone euro.
B.2. La compétitivité des entreprises
Dans ce contexte, en raison notamment de la concurrence internationale, il est également
crucial de développer les « forces d'agglomération », c'est-à-dire les incitations qui
forcent les entreprises à se concentrer géographiquement pour bénéficier d'économies
d'échelle et externes. L'existence d'une zone à pouvoir d'achat élevé est notamment l'un des
facteurs importants de la localisation des entreprises européennes. J'ai déjà mentionné les
forces d'attractivité de la zone euro mais il nous faut aller plus loin encore, en particulier en ce
qui concerne la maîtrise des coûts, notamment salariaux, et la nécessité d'assurer un
environnement favorable à la compétitivité des entreprises européennes. En effet, les emplois
sont créés de préférence dans les économies qui savent modérer leurs coûts unitaires de
production et offrir un environnement aussi favorable que possible à la compétitivité des
entreprises. Cela suppose donc que soient poursuivies, les réformes structurelles sur le marché
du travail et celui des biens et des services.
B.3. La flexibilité sur le marché du travail
• En ce qui concerne le marché du travail, la zone euro est caractérisée par un faible
taux d'emploi, supérieur à 63 % en 2004 contre 75 % aux États-Unis, ce qui se traduit par
une perte non négligeable en termes de PIB par habitant (près de 25 % inférieur à celui des
États-Unis). Ce bas taux d'emploi résulte du niveau élevé du chômage dans la zone euro,
proche de 9 % actuellement et surtout de la faiblesse du taux d'activité.
• Le chômage en Europe étant pour l'essentiel d'origine structurelle, il importe dès lors
de fluidifier le marché du travail et de préserver une structure d'incitations
permettant d'élever le taux d'activité. Cela suppose notamment que soient mises en
25
<U+009C>uvre des mesures visant à réduire le coût du travail, les charges des entreprises mais
également que soient promues des structures d'incitations à destination des actifs parmi les
classes d'âges les plus jeunes mais également les plus âgées ainsi que pour les moins
qualifiés. Contrairement à ce que l'on observe aux États-Unis, où existe une longue
tradition de mobilité professionnelle et géographique, les différences culturelles et
linguistiques constituent encore un frein à la mobilité du facteur travail en Europe. La
faiblesse de la mobilité professionnelle et géographique dépend également d'une
différentiation sans doute insuffisante des salaires dans les pays de la zone euro qui
permettraient de mieux refléter les différences en termes de gains de productivité ou de
développement entre régions ou secteurs d'activité.
B.4. L'intégration des marchés des biens et services
• L'accroissement du niveau de productivité dans la zone euro repose également sur
l'approfondissement des réformes sur le marché des biens et services car le retard
européen, vis-à-vis notamment des États-Unis, trouve également son origine dans la
présence de rigidités structurelles liées à l'existence de barrières à l'entrée sur ce marché.
Or, en l'absence de pressions concurrentielles, les entreprises ne sont guère incitées à
accroître leur efficacité.
• Des réformes réglementaires doivent donc être entreprises tant au niveau des pays
membres qu'au niveau de l'Union économique dans son ensemble. D'après les travaux
de recherche conduits sous l'égide du CEPR et de l'Eurosystème, la création du marché
unique a déjà constitué une étape majeure mais l'objectif reste bien celui d'une
intégration complète du marché des biens et services au niveau européen. Cela concerne
notamment le secteur des services où, il faut bien le reconnaître, les progrès ont été
moins nets que dans les autres secteurs d'activité. Certes, cela s'explique encore pour partie
par des différences culturelles. Il reste que les pouvoirs publics, au niveau national comme
au niveau communautaire, doivent poursuivre leurs efforts et favoriser le degré de
concurrence et d'intégration dans tous les secteurs d'activité. Je mentionnais celui des
services, mais c'est également le cas des secteurs de l'énergie, notamment électrique, des
transports, notamment ferroviaires, ou encore des services postaux.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 Ce chiffre sera actualisé lors de la publication par Eurostat des statistiques 2004 (officiellement avant la fin du mois de mars).
26
C. Le défi de l'élargissement
Dix nouveaux pays ont rejoint l'UE le 1er mai 2004. Ils ont vocation à adopter l'euro après
avoir satisfait aux critères de convergence nominale. Au-delà des défis institutionnels qui
subsistent (indépendance des banques centrales, adaptation de systèmes bancaires, lutte contre
le blanchiment, etc.), le défi majeur qui s'ouvre à nous est de relever le pari de la
convergence réelle entre l'Est et l'Ouest de l'Europe. Cet objectif nécessitera des années
d'importantes réformes structurelles favorables à une accélération de la croissance et au
comblement du fossé Est-Ouest ; il suppose notamment le respect du cadre macroéconomique
auquel tous les Etats membres parties à l'euro aujourd'hui ont consenti, en particulier la
participation réussie au MCE II. Il faut en effet éviter toute précipitation dommageable à la
compétitivité et procéder aux réformes de fond, notamment en matière de soutenabilité des
finances publiques, préalablement à l'entrée dans ce mécanisme de change, gage d'une
convergence réelle durable profitable à l'ensemble de la zone.
Conclusion
• Je souhaiterais conclure en disant que l'euro a répondu à nos attentes. Après le défi
sans précédent du passage à l'euro fiduciaire à l'échelle du continent, qui a été couronné de
succès, l'euro a remplacé quasi-instantanément les anciennes monnaies nationales, sans
perturbation logistique. Il a encouragé la stabilité grâce à la crédibilité dont il jouit et a
protégé nombre de pays de la zone contre la volatilité excessive des taux de change et les
turbulences enregistrées sur les marchés financiers. Ces résultats doivent être soulignés
avec d'autant plus d'insistance que pendant plusieurs années il avait été dit que l'euro
resterait un « serpent de mer » ou qu'il créerait des difficultés macroéconomiques
importantes. Ces scénarios ne se sont pas concrétisés.
• L'euro représente donc une pierre angulaire majeure de la construction européenne.
Cela dit, et indépendamment de ses propres mérites, une monnaie ne constitue pas une fin
en soi même si les nouveaux États membres sont ardemment déterminés à l'adopter le
plus vite possible. La participation à l'union monétaire doit reposer sur un processus de
convergence soutenable. L'élargissement de la zone euro donnera à cet égard un nouvel
élan au relèvement des défis, les responsables de politique économique subissant
27
désormais une pression beaucoup plus forte dans le traitement des difficultés alors qu'ils
pouvaient les ignorer auparavant. Il s'agit là d'une contribution essentielle à la construction
d'une union européenne plus forte à laquelle j'adhère vigoureusement.
En conclusion, laissez-moi exprimer ma confiance en l'avenir de l'euro qui, six ans après sa
création, constitue le symbole patent de l'identité européenne et de sa force.

   Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
20ème anniversaire de l’ABE 
La contribution des infrastructures de paiement à l’intégration financière 
européenne et à la mise en place du SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) 
 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
 
 
Je suis très heureux de fêter avec vous le 20ème anniversaire de l’Association bancaire pour 
l’euro (ABE), ici à Paris au Palais Brongniart. J’aimerais avant toute chose saluer l’ABE pour 
son engagement fort en faveur de l’intégration financière européenne. Cet engagement a 
abouti à la création du système de montant élevé EURO 1 et des systèmes de détail STEP 1 et 
STEP 2.  
 
Les banques centrales de l’Eurosystème, comme toutes les banques centrales, ont un vif 
intérêt à s’assurer que le système financier, dans leur zone monétaire de compétence, soit 
unifié, compétitif et stable. Cela est essentiel pour l’économie européenne puisqu’un degré 
élevé d’intégration permet une transmission efficace de la politique monétaire, une meilleure 
allocation des ressources financières, une minimisation du coût du capital, ainsi qu’une 
exécution rapide et sûre des paiements au sein de ce que l’on appelle le SEPA (« Single Euro 
Payments Area »), c’est-à-dire l’espace unique des paiements en euro. 
 
Différents facteurs contribuent au développement d’un système financier pleinement intégré à 
l’échelle européenne. Je m’intéresserai aujourd’hui à un facteur-clé de ce processus, à savoir 
les infrastructures de paiement. Je m’attacherai en particulier à souligner ce qui a déjà été 
réalisé dans ce domaine et ce qui reste à faire. 
 
Je commencerai mon intervention en montrant l’importance, pour l’intégration financière 
européenne, du développement d’infrastructures efficaces et sûres. Puis, j’évaluerai les 
progrès réalisés dans ce secteur depuis le lancement de l’euro. Précisons d’emblée que cette 
évaluation est contrastée : alors que la situation peut être considérée comme satisfaisante en 
ce qui concerne les systèmes de paiement de montant élevé, elle l’est moins en ce qui 
 2
concerne les systèmes de paiement de détail. C’est pourquoi j’indiquerai en conclusion les 
évolutions qui me paraissent nécessaires au renforcement de l’intégration des paiements de 
détail.  
1.  Les infrastructures de paiement sont un facteur nécessaire de 
l’intégration financière 
Par « infrastructures de paiement », on entend l’ensemble des procédures et systèmes utilisés 
par les intermédiaires financiers pour échanger des ordres de paiement émis par les agents 
économiques. Ces infrastructures jouent par conséquent un rôle fondamental dans le bon 
fonctionnement de l’économie dans son ensemble : en permettant des transferts financiers 
efficaces et sûrs entre agents économiques, elles apportent une contribution-clé à l’une des 
fonctions élémentaires de la monnaie, à savoir la fonction d’instrument de transaction.   
 
Dans l’Union européenne (UE), les infrastructures qui traitent des paiements en euro sont 
constituées de dispositifs de nature différente. Par exemple, des ordres de paiement en euro 
peuvent être échangés au sein de systèmes multilatéraux ou dans le cadre de mécanismes 
bilatéraux de correspondent banking. Nonobstant la multiplicité de ces dispositifs, les 
transferts d’argent entre intermédiaires financiers tendent, en pratique, à se concentrer sur un 
petit nombre d’entre eux.  
 
A l’heure actuelle, l’essentiel des ordres de paiement se règle via les systèmes de paiement 
multilatéraux. Au vu des études menées par l’Eurosystème depuis 1999, ces derniers 
représentent environ 80% des échanges, tant en volume qu’en valeur. Cependant, il ne faut 
pas minimiser la place du correspondent banking, qui représente encore 20% des échanges et 
se caractérise par un degré élevé de concentration : sur l’ensemble des banques qui ont 
répondu à l’enquête de l’Eurosystème, les dix plus grandes traitent environ 80 % de la valeur 
totale des transactions de correspondent banking, certaines d’entre elles ayant en la matière 
une activité d’ampleur comparable à celle de certains systèmes interbancaires.  
La problématique de la diversité des infrastructures de paiement en euro au sein de l’UE est 
apparue dans la perspective de l’introduction de l’euro. A cette époque, nous avons pris 
conscience des inconvénients de la diversité, dans la mesure où celle-ci s’accompagne d’un 
écart de niveau de service entre les paiements nationaux et transfrontières, au détriment de ces 
derniers. A l’aune de l’objectif d’intégration financière, il était clair que cette situation ne 
 3
pouvait être considérée comme optimale. Mais cette problématique de la diversité a été prise 
en compte avant même le lancement de l’euro. La réorganisation technique de la chaîne de 
traitement des paiements, qui visait notamment à faire disparaître les écarts, en termes 
d’efficacité et de sécurité, entre infrastructures transfrontières et nationales, apparaissait alors 
comme un pilier du processus conduisant à un degré élevé d’intégration monétaire et 
financière en Europe. 
 
L’Eurosystème a été étroitement associé au mouvement de suppression des obstacles à 
l’intégration financière européenne, en particulier dans le domaine des infrastructures de 
paiement, soutenant ainsi les initiatives de marché, notamment celles de l’ABE. Cette 
implication forte trouve sa justification dans les statuts mêmes de l’Eurosystème. En effet, 
l’une des missions fondamentales confiées par le Traité à l’Eurosystème est de promouvoir le 
bon fonctionnement des systèmes de paiement, mission que l’Eurosystème a jusqu’ici 
déclinée en trois modes d’intervention : (i) en tant que prestataire de service de compensation 
et de règlement avec la gestion du système TARGET ; (ii) en tant que catalyseur des efforts 
des acteurs de marché en vue de créer le SEPA pour les paiements de détail ; (iii) en tant que 
surveillant du bon fonctionnement des systèmes de paiement en euro.    
2.  La situation actuelle est marquée par une différence significative de 
degré d’intégration des infrastructures de paiement 
J’en viens maintenant aux avancées qui ont été réalisées dans le processus d’intégration des 
infrastructures de paiement. Le degré d’intégration dépend du segment du marché concerné. 
Alors que le segment relatif aux paiements de montant élevé, qui a déjà atteint un fort degré 
de rationalisation et de consolidation, va poursuivre son intégration avec le lancement du 
système TARGET 2, celui des paiements de détail se caractérise encore par une assez grande 
fragmentation. 
 
Dans le domaine des infrastructures de paiement de montant élevé, l’intégration s’est opérée 
très rapidement. N’oublions pas que la création d’EURO 1 et de TARGET visait à relever le 
défi de l’UEM. Il était particulièrement important que les paiements de montant élevé, surtout 
ceux liés au marché monétaire, reposent sur des systèmes traitant de façon efficace et sûre les 
transactions transfrontières. De surcroît, TARGET était un préalable à la mise en oeuvre de la 
politique monétaire unique. Le calendrier de réalisation deTARGET était particulièrement 
 4
serré, ce qui explique que le système actuel (TARGET 1) repose sur un principe 
d’harmonisation minimale, par interconnexion des RTGS nationaux (Real-Time Gross 
Settlement Systems- systèmes de règlement brut en temps réel). 
 
TARGET 2, qui devrait voir le jour en 2007, va permettre d’aller encore plus loin dans 
l’intégration des infrastructures de paiement de montant élevé. Il offrira des services 
totalement harmonisés, en temps réel et en monnaie centrale, avec une tarification unifiée 
pour les paiements nationaux et transfrontières et tournera sur une plate-forme unique de 
traitement. Cette dernière sera utilisée par l’ensemble des banques centrales du SEBC pour 
fournir des services à leurs communautés bancaires respectives. TARGET 2 assurera une 
meilleure efficacité en termes de coût  et sera doté de procédures à l’état de l’art en matière de 
continuité de service.  
 
En moins de dix ans depuis le lancement de l’euro, le nombre des systèmes de paiement en 
euro en fonctionnement dans l’UE sera ainsi tombé de vingt-et-un (les 16 composantes de 
TARGET 1 plus 5 systèmes privés) à deux (TARGET 2 et EURO 1), mettant ainsi l’Europe à 
égalité avec les Etats-Unis en termes d’intégration des infrastructures de paiement de montant 
élevé. 
 
Du côté des paiements de détail, la situation est bien différente. On compte en effet 
aujourd’hui dans l’UE 15 systèmes de compensation et de règlement de détail en euro, c’est-
à-dire presque autant qu’il y a dix ans, et rien n’indique pour l’instant que ce chiffre va baisser 
de façon significative à court ou moyen terme. Le marché est donc caractérisé par la 
multiplicité des systèmes nationaux de paiement de détail multilatéraux, qui coexistent avec 
une variété d’autres dispositifs de paiement tels que les systèmes bilatéraux, les réseaux cartes 
internationaux ou les solutions de « clubs » bancaires.   
 
Des progrès significatifs ont été accomplis dans la marche vers l’intégration depuis 
l’introduction des billets et pièces en euro. En 2002, la communauté bancaire européenne a 
lancé le projet SEPA et s’est fixé pour objectif que, d’ici 2010 « tous les paiements soient 
considérés comme domestiques en termes de rapidité de traitement, de sécurité, de facilité 
d’utilisation et de coût ».  
 
 5
Cependant, la concrétisation de cet objectif ambitieux implique une évolution significative 
des infrastructures actuelles de paiement de détail vers une infrastructure pan-européenne, dite 
PEACH, qui vise à renforcer l’efficience globale des paiements en Europe. Jusqu’à présent, la 
principale réalisation en la matière a été le lancement de STEP 2 : c’est en effet la première 
infrastructure conforme aux critères PEACH, tels que définis par l’EPC (European Payments 
Council – Conseil des paiements européens). Mais, sachant que STEP 2 traite de faibles 
volumes (170 000 paiements en mai 2005) et n’est toujours pas en mesure d’offrir le même 
niveau de service que les systèmes nationaux, beaucoup de chemin reste à parcourir. 
 
Une évolution positive mérite toutefois d’être notée : la plupart des systèmes de paiement de 
détail nationaux se préparent maintenant à la mise en oeuvre du SEPA, dans le contexte d’une 
généralisation de la normalisation visant à assurer l’interopérabilité des infrastructures. En 
France, par exemple, un certain nombre de banques ont lancé le projet STET en perspective 
du SEPA. Notons toutefois que l’idée de consolider les plateformes des systèmes de détail 
n’occupe toujours pas à l’heure actuelle le premier plan des initiatives de marché, alors même 
que la consolidation constitue une source d’économies et d’efficience. 
 
Pourquoi existe-t-il un tel écart dans le niveau d’intégration entre les systèmes de paiement de 
montant élevé et les systèmes de paiement de détail? Je vois deux éléments d’explication 
principaux. En premier lieu, les systèmes de paiement de montant élevé ont bénéficié de 
l’aiguillon de la politique monétaire unique qui imposait la création de TARGET. En second 
lieu, la problématique de l’intégration est plus complexe dans le cas des infrastructures de 
paiement de détail : en effet, alors que les infrastructures de paiement de montant élevé 
traitent un seul type d’instrument de paiement (le virement), la diversité des instruments de 
paiement de détail rend l’intégration des infrastructures de détail nationales plus difficile. De 
plus, les coûts de transition et les problèmes de coordination sont importants.  
3.  L’intégration des infrastructures de paiement de détail est devenue une 
priorité dans le programme de travail de l’Eurosystème 
Il est particulièrement important que la communauté bancaire européenne se mobilise sur la 
question des paiements de détail et relève le défi de la création d’une infrastructure de 
paiement de détail pleinement intégrée. L’enjeu est évident : il en va du succès du SEPA. Les 
outils permettant de construire un SEPA pour les infrastructures sont connus de tous. 
 6
J’aimerais toutefois les rappeler rapidement: il s’agit d’une part de mettre en oeuvre la 
standardisation et l’interopérabilité entre les systèmes, d’autre part d’assurer une égalité 
d’accès aux intermédiaires financiers quelle que soit l’implantation géographique nationale. 
 
L’EPC s’est engagé à fournir deux instruments de paiement pan-européens (un pour les 
virements et un autre pour les débits directs) et à développer un cadre commun pour les cartes, 
et à les mettre à la disposition de la clientèle d’ici 2008. Par ailleurs, l’EPC s’attend à ce que 
« une masse critique de transactions migre naturellement vers ces instruments de paiements 
d’ici 2010 de telle manière que le SEPA devienne irréversible grâce au jeu des forces de 
marché et aux effets de réseaux ». 
 
Deux éléments-clé conditionnent le succès de la nouvelle stratégie de l’EPC. D’une part, 
l’attractivité des instruments de paiement pan-européens pour les consommateurs. Pour être 
réellement attractifs, les instruments de paiement pan-européens doivent être de la « meilleure 
espèce » ; c’est-à-dire offrir un niveau de service qui converge vers les meilleures pratiques en 
la matière en Europe. D’autre part, il faut faire en sorte que les infrastructures soient prêtes à 
soutenir l’effet de masse critique attendu pour ce qui concerne l’adoption par les 
consommateurs des instruments de paiement pan-européens. L’échéance 2010 pour la 
conformité des infrastructures avec le SEPA, selon la recommandation de l’Eurosystème, est 
donc cruciale. 
 
Cette “conformité SEPA” pour les infrastructures suppose en particulier que l’interopérabilité 
entre toutes les infrastructures de détail soit assurée. La définition et la mise en œuvre de 
règles relatives à l’interopérabilité peuvent certainement être prises en charge par les banques 
(« auto-régulation ») ainsi que le demande l’EPC. Conformément à la politique de soutien des 
initiatives de marché, l’Eurosystème, comme Jean-Claude Trichet vous l’a déjà expliqué ce 
matin, est prêt à aider l’industrie bancaire dans son travail de définition et de mise en œuvre 
de telles règles. 
 
Pour conclure, il me paraît essentiel que les efforts entrepris par l’ensemble de l’industrie 
bancaire depuis 2002 portent leurs fruits, de sorte que le SEPA devienne rapidement une 
réalité tangible pour les citoyens, les entreprises et les autres agents économiques. L’évolution 
du mode de fonctionnement des infrastructures de paiement est un élément-clé dans cette 
perspective. Le secteur des paiements de gros est sur le point d’entrer dans une phase décisive 
 7
du mouvement de consolidation avec le lancement de TARGET 2 par les banques centrales. 
Des avancées significatives sont également indispensables du côté des paiements de détail: 
dans le domaine des infrastructures, cela devrait notamment impliquer l’interopérabilité, qui 
devrait aboutir, du fait de la concurrence, à la sélection par le marché des meilleures 
infrastructures pour le SEPA.  
 
 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

L’EURO : UNE MONNAIE STABLE AU SERVICE D’UNE 
ECONOMIE DYNAMIQUE
BESANÇON, 8 DECEMBRE 2005
2
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
• C'est un grand plaisir pour moi d’intervenir à l’Université de Besançon, pour vous parler 
de l’euro, qui est l'une des réalisations les plus remarquables de l’Union Européenne.
• Depuis quelques mois, dans la foulée du choc psychologique créé par le résultat négatif 
des référendums sur la constitution européenne en France et aux Pays-Bas, plusieurs 
mises en cause publiques de la monnaie unique ont été formulées, et beaucoup de 
commentateurs s’interrogent sur le lien entre l’adoption de l’euro et la langueur de 
l’économie de la zone euro. Certains sont même allés jusqu’à mettre en doute sa 
pérennité.
• Je ne vous surprendrai pas en vous disant que ces critiques et ces interrogations me 
semblent absurdes et dénuées de tout fondement. Je voudrais surtout souligner deux 
choses capitales :
- la première, c’est que la zone euro se caractérise par une très grande divergence dans le 
degré de flexibilité des économies : d’un côté, des pays dont l’économie n’est que peu 
entravée par les rigidités structurelles classiques de la vieille Europe : l’Espagne, 
l’Irlande... De l’autre, des poids lourds qui avancent très lentement dans la voie des 
réformes économiques : l’Allemagne, la France, l’Italie. Or, il y a une assez grande 
corrélation entre les performances en termes de croissance potentielle et le degré 
d’adaptabilité de l’économie des différents pays de la zone. Pointer du doigt la monnaie 
comme source des difficultés économiques de la zone prise dans son ensemble revient à 
nier cette réalité ; 
- la seconde, c’est que l’introduction de l’euro a été et demeure un succès extraordinaire. 
Or, ce succès ne résulte pas d’un coup de baguette magique, mais du fait que cette 
introduction a été soigneusement pensée, et que les fondements de l’Union économique 
et monétaire qui ont été mis en place sont extrêmement solides et efficaces.  
Je voudrais tout d’abord évoquer les réalisations de la politique monétaire unique puis la 
coopération macroéconomique au sein de l’Union économique et monétaire. Enfin, j'aimerais 
aborder brièvement l'intégration économique au sein de la zone euro.  
3
PARTIE 1: LES RÉALISATIONS DE LA POLITIQUE MONÉTAIRE
UNIQUE
La base juridique de la monnaie unique est le traité instituant la Communauté européenne, dont 
l’article 105 dispose : « L’objectif principal du SEBC est de maintenir la stabilité des prix ». 
La stabilité des prix ainsi que la convergence des économies de la zone euro sont des 
préalables indispensables pour que la monnaie unique soit capable d’apporter pleinement 
« son soutien aux politiques économiques générales dans la Communauté, en vue de 
contribuer à la réalisation des objectifs de la Communauté, tels que définis à l’article 2 » du 
traité. 
Depuis près de sept ans, la politique monétaire unique conduite par l'Eurosystème, c'est-à-
dire l'ensemble constitué par la Banque centrale européenne et les douze banques centrales 
des pays membres de la zone euro, a été couronnée par de nombreux succès. Le passage 
réussi à l'euro, sous forme scripturale puis fiduciaire, constitue le premier d’entre eux, 
probablement le plus emblématique. Je rappellerai d’abord le cadre institutionnel et 
opérationnel (A) et la stratégie (B) de la politique monétaire unique avant d’évoquer ces 
réalisations (C).
A. Un cadre institutionnel et opérationnel moderne
Le cadre institutionnel de l’Eurosystème repose sur les principes d'indépendance, de 
transparence et de responsabilité et, enfin, de décentralisation opérationnelle.
A.1 L'indépendance de l'Eurosystème favorise la stabilité des prix
• Ainsi que l'ont montré de nombreux travaux empiriques, la performance anti-
inflationniste d'une nation semble très fortement corrélée au degré d'indépendance 
de sa banque centrale. 
• Or, l'Eurosystème a pour mission principale, d'après le Traité de Maastricht, d'assurer et 
de maintenir la stabilité des prix. L'indépendance de la Banque centrale européenne et 
des douze banques centrales des pays membres de la zone euro est donc inscrite 
dans le Traité.
4
• Au plan fonctionnel, cela signifie que, dans l'exercice de leur mission, ni la Banque 
centrale européenne ni les banques centrales nationales de l'Eurosystème ne cherchent ni 
ne prennent d'instruction des institutions communautaires, des gouvernements 
nationaux ou d'une quelconque autre instance.  
A.2. La transparence et la responsabilité sont essentielles pour assurer la crédibilité
• Naturellement, l'indépendance de ces institutions a pour contrepartie la transparence 
de leurs décisions et la responsabilité vis-à-vis du public et de ses représentants.
Pour établir la crédibilité de la banque centrale, pour gagner la confiance des agents, il est 
absolument impératif d'être compris et pour cela, il est nécessaire d'être transparent.  
• Les impératifs de responsabilité et de transparence sont inscrits dans le Traité en termes 
très généraux. L’Eurosystème est allé au-delà des strictes obligations institutionnelles 
lui incombant, dans ces domaines : 
- en premier lieu, le Conseil des Gouverneurs a précisé sa définition de la stabilité des 
prix (hausse inférieure à, mais proche de, 2 % à moyen terme) ; 
- en deuxième lieu, la BCE est allée au-delà des exigences de responsabilité établies par 
le Traité en instituant des auditions régulières de son président devant le Parlement 
européen et des réunions informelles régulières avec l'Eurogroupe des ministres des 
Finances ; 
- un autre signe de transparence réside dans la publication régulière de rapports sur les 
évolutions économiques et les analyses de la Banque centrale, dont le Bulletin mensuel 
de la BCE constitue le vecteur le plus connu ; 
-   enfin, point le plus important, à l'issue de chacune des réunions consacrées aux décisions 
de politique monétaire, le président et le vice-président de la BCE tiennent une
conférence de presse suivie d'un échange ouvert avec les journalistes, dont le détail est 
publié sur le site Internet de la BCE. Il est important de rappeler que la BCE a été la 
première des banques centrales à se soumettre à ce type d'exercice, qui fournit une 
5
occasion unique d'expliquer et de commenter les décisions de politique monétaire, 
immédiatement et de façon détaillée ;  
- en revanche, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a choisi de ne pas publier les 
procès-verbaux de ses réunions. En effet, la publication des procès-verbaux présente 
certains inconvénients. Notamment, dans le cas de la zone euro, l'analyse des votes 
pourrait être lue et interprétée à la lumière de préoccupations ou d'intérêts 
nationaux, ce qui serait fallacieux et pourrait menacer à la fois l'indépendance des 
membres du Conseil des gouverneurs et la crédibilité de nos processus de prise de 
décision. Exhaustif, un procès-verbal serait, en outre, de nature à compliquer l’évolution 
des prises de décision. Succinct, il n’apporterait rien par rapport au compte rendu du 
Président.
A.3. L'Eurosystème repose sur la décentralisation opérationnelle
• La décentralisation opérationnelle constitue une caractéristique essentielle de 
l'Eurosystème.
• L'utilisation de technologies et de moyens de communication modernes a permis de 
concilier parfaitement décentralisation des opérations et unité du marché monétaire de la 
zone euro.
B. Le cadre stratégique
L’efficacité de la politique monétaire unique repose également sur son cadre stratégique, 
lequel peut être caractérisé par une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix et une 
orientation à moyen terme.
B.1. Une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix
• La définition retenue par le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE en octobre 1998 a 
été confirmée et précisée en mai 2003. La stabilité des prix est définie par une croissance 
annuelle de l'IPCH proche de, mais inférieure à, 2 % à moyen terme.  
6
• Le Conseil des gouverneurs a ainsi confirmé le caractère symétrique de sa stratégie en 
excluant les situations de déflation. Cette précision permet également la prise en compte 
des écarts d'inflation au sein de la zone euro. 
B.2. Une orientation à moyen terme
• Cette orientation à moyen terme de la politique monétaire unique reconnaît qu'il est 
impossible, pour une banque centrale, de contrôler avec exactitude la trajectoire des prix à 
très court terme.
De ce fait, les indicateurs pertinents pour la politique monétaire doivent refléter, 
de façon quasi-exhaustive, les principaux facteurs à l'origine de l'inflation à 
court comme à long terme. C'est ce que traduisent les notions d'approche 
économique et d'approche monétaire (que l'on qualifie également d'approche en deux 
piliers). L'approche économique passe en revue les indicateurs conjoncturels, 
économiques et financiers en rapport avec les principaux déterminants de l'inflation à 
court terme. L’approche monétaire repose quant à elle sur l'explication monétaire de 
l'inflation à long terme. 
C. Les réalisations de la politique monétaire unique
Je voudrais souligner trois points essentiels :
• Premièrement, alors qu'elle a été confrontée à une série de chocs défavorables (sur les 
prix du pétrole, les prix administrés…), la politique monétaire unique est parvenue à 
stabiliser et ancrer, sur la totalité de la période d'exercice, les anticipations d'inflation à 
moyen - long terme autour de 1,8 à 1,9 %. Toutefois, dans le contexte de la hausse récente 
des prix du pétrole, certains indicateurs d’inflation prévue dont ceux tirés des marchés 
financiers ont eu tendance à progresser légèrement au-dessus de 2 %. La récente hausse 
des taux d’intérêt a contribué à ramener ces anticipations d'inflation à moyen et long 
termes à des niveaux compatibles avec la stabilité des prix dans la zone euro.
• Deuxièmement, la plupart des décisions de politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème ont été 
parfaitement anticipées par les marchés. Contrairement à certaines idées reçues, la 
comparaison avec la FED ne montre pas de réelle différence dans la prévisibilité vis-à-vis 
7
des marchés. Le fait que la BCE a choisi d’autres moyens de communications que les 
procès-verbaux n’a pas nui à la compréhension et à la prévisibilité de sa politique 
monétaire (les rapports des « ECB watchers » sont clairs à cet égard).
• Troisièmement, l’euro s’est imposé auprès des agents économiques et fait désormais 
partie du quotidien des consommateurs européens.
PARTIE 2 : LES PROCÉDURES DE SURVEILLANCE MULTILATÉRALE AU 
SEIN DE L'UEM
Dans l'UEM, où coexistent une politique monétaire unique et douze gouvernements 
responsables des politiques budgétaires et des politiques structurelles, un cadre institutionnel 
approprié est indispensable pour assurer une cohérence d’ensemble. C’est notamment l’objet 
du Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance. Pour que ce cadre soit pleinement opérationnel, il doit 
être simple, facile à mettre en œuvre et capable d'assurer des politiques budgétaires saines et 
soutenables. C’est ainsi que les processus de surveillance multilatérale ont été conçus dès 
l'origine, afin d'atteindre un niveau de cohésion satisfaisant dans les politiques suivies par 
tous les États membres. 
A. Un cadre de procédures de surveillance multilatérale
• La mise en œuvre de la surveillance est confiée à l'Eurogroupe (réunion informelle 
des ministres des Finances des pays de la zone euro) et au Conseil Ecofin (réunion 
des ministres des Finances de tous les pays de l'UE, ayant pouvoir décisionnel), 
conjointement avec la Commission européenne. La surveillance mutuelle combine les 
procédures multilatérales de surveillance et de dialogue, le respect de règles et de 
dispositions communes, et l'engagement des États membres à respecter les bonnes 
pratiques et les objectifs communs. 
• Le respect des règles et des procédures formulées dans le Traité et des dispositions 
du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance imposent la même discipline budgétaire à 
tous les États membres : le déficit budgétaire ne doit pas excéder le plafond de 3 % du 
PIB et le ratio d'endettement total ne devrait pas dépasser 60 % du PIB. Ces limites 
contribuent à assurer un policy-mix optimal au niveau de la zone euro, dans la mesure où 
8
une politique budgétaire laxiste risque, à terme, de compromettre la réalisation de la 
stabilité des prix. Enfin, elles entretiennent une croissance et un emploi durables et sont 
propices à la stabilité économique.
• La discipline budgétaire est en effet d'une importance capitale pour l'UEM, car elle 
est un corollaire nécessaire de la politique monétaire unique. On attend des États membres 
qu'ils considèrent leurs politiques économiques comme des questions « d'intérêt 
commun », étant donné l'incidence que leurs décisions budgétaires peuvent avoir sur la 
zone euro dans son ensemble. Dans une union monétaire, il est de la plus grande 
importance d’éviter les « comportements de passager clandestin », d'où la clause 
de « non-renflouement » inscrite dans le Traité de Maastricht.
• Une réforme du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance (PSC) a été adoptée par le Conseil 
Européen du 22 mars 2005, faisant suite aux propositions de réforme de la Commission de 
septembre 2004. Cette réforme confirme le rôle important du Pacte en matière de 
discipline budgétaire, précise les conditions de déclenchement de la Procédure pour déficit 
excessif et introduit un léger allongement des délais de correction des déficits excessifs. 
• A la suite de cet accord du Conseil Européen, le Conseil des Gouverneurs de la BCE s’est 
exprimé publiquement pour insister sur le fait qu’il est impératif que les États membres, la 
Commission européenne et le Conseil de l’Union européenne mettent en œuvre le cadre 
révisé d’une manière rigoureuse et cohérente, propice à la conduite de politiques 
budgétaires prudentes. 
B. Les nouveaux États membres respectent les mêmes règles
Laissez-moi souligner le fait que les dix nouveaux États membres sont déjà habitués aux 
processus d'examen mutuel. Depuis leur adhésion, le 1er mai 2004, la politique budgétaire des 
dix nouveaux États membres a été soumise aux mêmes mesures d'examen que celle des autres 
États membres. Ces pays sont maintenant contraints d'entreprendre des réformes budgétaires 
substantielles, d'autant plus que leurs déficits proviennent en grande partie d'insuffisances 
structurelles.

PARTIE 3 : L'EURO : UN MOTEUR PUISSANT D’INTÉGRATION ÉCONOMIQUE 
ET FINANCIÈRE ET DE RAYONNEMENT INTERNATIONAL DE L’EUROPE
L’euro repose sur des fondamentaux solides et a favorisé autant que bénéficié d’une 
intégration financière presque achevée. Il joue désormais le rôle de monnaie 
internationale. 
A. Des fondamentaux solides et une grande homogénéité économique
Les économies de la zone euro se caractérisent, actuellement, par un important 
degré de convergence structurelle, un faible niveau d'inflation, proche de 2 %, et 
des conditions monétaires et financières favorables à l'activité économique.
Si l'Union monétaire n'implique pas nécessairement que tous les États membres affichent, à 
tout moment, le même taux de croissance ou d'inflation, un certain nombre de travaux 
empiriques récents illustrent une homogénéité économique croissante au sein de la zone euro.  
• En termes d'activité tout d'abord, plusieurs travaux présentés sous l'égide d'un groupe 
de travail commun entre le CEPR (Centre for Economic Policy Research) et
l'Eurosystème montrent que la corrélation entre les fluctuations cycliques de l'activité 
économique dans son ensemble dans la plupart des pays de la zone euro, déjà forte 
avant la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire unique, s'est accrue depuis 1999.
Le degré de corrélation n’apparaît pas sensiblement différent de celui des Etats-unis : 
l’ordre de grandeur de l’écart type est le même entre les 4 grands de la Zone euro et les 
12 zones économique américaines (1 point)  ainsi qu’entre les 50 Etats américains et 
les 12 Etats de la Zone Euro (2 points).    
• En termes d'inflation, selon les travaux menés par l’Eurosystème, le degré de 
dispersion des rythmes d'inflation au sein de la zone euro ne serait pas nettement 
supérieur à celui que l'on observe aux États-Unis où existent des forces de rappel 
bien plus fortes que dans la zone euro - telles que la présence d'un budget fédéral unique 
équilibrant les différences cycliques entre régions, des marchés des biens et services et du 
travail plus unifiés, une politique monétaire unique depuis 1913. Ainsi, sur ces premières 
années d'existence de l'UEM, l'écart-type du glissement annuel des prix dans les douze 
10
pays de la zone euro serait, selon les estimations, proche de 1 point contre 0,8 point pour 
les quatorze zones métropolitaines des États-Unis.
• Enfin, les mises à jour récentes de l'important travail de recherche effectué par 
l'Eurosystème sur les mécanismes de transmission de la politique monétaire unique 
tendent à indiquer une homogénéité croissante des réponses des économies des pays 
membres aux impulsions de la politique monétaire. Notamment, l’écart-type des délais 
d’ajustement des taux des crédits bancaires aux variations du taux directeur aurait, en 
moyenne,  diminué de moitié depuis la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire unique.
B. Une intégration presque achevée du secteur financier 
• Cette dernière est quasiment achevée en ce qui concerne le marché monétaire de l'euro.  
• Un mouvement d'intégration comparable s'est également produit sur les marchés
obligataires européens, où l'on a pu constater un resserrement des rendements des 
titres d'État, ainsi que sur les marchés dérivés et, dans une moindre mesure, sur les 
marchés boursiers et le marché des émissions de titres de dette pour les entreprises. 
• La zone euro et, plus largement, l'Union européenne disposent à présent d'une 
architecture financière cohérente. La mise en œuvre du Plan d'Action pour les 
Services Financiers, défini au Conseil européen de Lisbonne en mars 2000, est en cours 
d'achèvement. Le « processus Lamfalussy » devrait favoriser la mise en place d'une 
nouvelle architecture institutionnelle dans le domaine de la supervision et de la 
réglementation du secteur financier. 
C. L'euro joue désormais le rôle de monnaie internationale 
Le rôle croissant de l'euro à l'échelle internationale résulte du développement à la fois de son 
utilisation au niveau privé et de son rôle officiel.
• L'euro possède les fonctions-clés que l'on attribue à toute monnaie internationale : il 
s'agit déjà d'une monnaie de placement et de financement de premier plan (31 % de 
l’encours de titres de créances internationales) et d'un intermédiaire important des 
échanges internationaux (impliqué dans 43 % des opérations de change). Même s'il est 
11
encore limité, son rôle de monnaie de facturation devrait se développer dans les années à 
venir.
• Selon les dernières données disponibles du FMI, l'euro était la deuxième monnaie de 
réserve après le dollar en 2004 ; et sa part semble s’être fortement accrue depuis 
1999 malgré un léger repli entre 2003 et 2004.
• L'utilisation de l'euro dans les régimes de change des pays tiers concerne 
essentiellement des régions qui ont tissé des liens étroits avec la zone euro ou qui 
ont mis en place des arrangements institutionnels spéciaux avec l'UE (pays adhérents 
et candidats, Balkans, Afrique du nord et zone franc). 
• En ce qui concerne les dix nouveaux pays de l'UE, laissez-moi souligner que le 
critère de stabilité des taux de change au sein du MCE II nécessite que cette stabilité 
soit atteinte avant l'adoption de la monnaie unique. L'avantage est que l'adoption 
de l'euro sera le couronnement d'un processus de convergence structuré au sein d'un 
cadre multilatéral. C'est assurément l'un des défis les plus importants auxquels devra faire 
face la zone euro dans les années à venir.
Conclusion
• Je souhaiterais conclure en disant que l'euro a répondu à nos attentes. Il a 
encouragé la stabilité grâce à la crédibilité dont il jouit et a protégé nombre de pays de la 
zone contre la volatilité excessive des taux de change et les turbulences enregistrées sur 
les marchés financiers.  
• L'euro représente donc une pierre angulaire majeure de la construction 
européenne. Cela dit, et indépendamment de ses propres mérites, une monnaie ne 
constitue pas une fin en soi même si les nouveaux États membres sont ardemment 
déterminés à l'adopter le plus vite possible. La participation à l'union monétaire doit 
reposer sur un processus de convergence soutenable. En effet, au-delà des défis
institutionnels qui subsistent (indépendance des banques centrales, adaptation de systèmes 
bancaires, lutte contre le blanchiment, etc.), le défi majeur qui s'ouvre à nous est de 
relever le pari de la convergence réelle entre l'Est et l'Ouest de l'Europe. Cet objectif 
12
nécessitera des années d'importantes réformes structurelles favorables à une accélération 
de la croissance et au comblement du fossé Est - Ouest ; il suppose notamment le respect 
du cadre macroéconomique auquel tous les Etats membres parties à l'euro aujourd'hui 
ont consenti, en particulier la participation réussie au MCE II. Il faut en effet éviter toute 
précipitation dommageable à la compétitivité et procéder aux réformes de fond, 
notamment en matière de soutenabilité des finances publiques, préalablement à l'entrée 
dans ce mécanisme de change, gage d'une convergence réelle durable profitable à 
l'ensemble de la zone.

LES DILEMMES DES BANQUES CENTRALES FACE À 
L’INCERTITUDE 
 
5 JUIN 2006 
 
BUENOS AIRES 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
 • Je tiens à vous remercier de m’avoir invité à participer à ce séminaire. C’est pour moi un 
grand plaisir d’intervenir sur un thème aussi intéressant, à savoir : « Les dilemmes des 
banques centrales face à l’incertitude ». 
 • Dans la première partie de mon intervention, je rappellerai la nature de l’incertitude et 
l’importance qu’elle revêt pour les banques centrales ; dans la seconde partie, je récapitulerai 
différentes propositions visant à répondre à cette incertitude. 
 
I/ La nature de l’incertitude 
L’incertitude se manifeste sous différentes formes. Il s’agit d’une question essentielle pour les 
banques centrales en général (I/1) et peut-être davantage encore pour l’Eurosystème (I/2). 
 
1) L’importance de l’incertitude pour les banques centrales 
 
 • L’importance des risques et de l’incertitude pour l’analyse économique a été évoquée 
initialement par Frank Knight (Risk, Uncertainty and Profit) en 1921. Le « risque » se 
rapporte aux situations dans lesquelles le décideur peut affecter des probabilités aux différents 
événements auxquels il est susceptible d’être confronté ; « l’incertitude » s’applique aux 
situations où ce caractère aléatoire ne peut se traduire en termes de probabilités. 
 • L’incertitude est une question essentielle pour les banques centrales : selon Alan 
Greenspan, « l’incertitude n’est pas simplement un élément important de la politique 
monétaire ; elle est la caractéristique majeure de cet environnement ». Par conséquent, je 
m’attacherai essentiellement à la politique monétaire, même si le sujet pourrait également 
s’appliquer à la stabilité financière, qui constitue une autre préoccupation majeure pour les 
banques centrales. 
 
2) L’Eurosystème est confronté à des sources d’incertitude générales mais également 
spécifiques 
 • D’un point de vue général, les incertitudes peuvent être liées : 
- aux indicateurs macroéconomiques, qui peuvent être inobservables (écart de 
production) ou sujets à révision (PIB) ; 
- à la nature et au degré de persistance des chocs : par exemple, les chocs affectant le 
pétrole et les matières premières, l’ampleur de leur diffusion aux prix, etc. ; 
- à la transmission de la politique monétaire à l’économie réelle, Milton Friedman ayant 
montré que « la politique monétaire agit avec des délais longs et variables » ; 
- aux distorsions éventuelles des prix des actifs et aux effets de richesse. 
 • Mais dans le cas de la zone euro, l’incertitude peut être encore plus marquée : 
- les séries chronologiques disponibles sont courtes ; 
- la zone euro a potentiellement connu un changement de régime à la Lucas ;  
- l’euro joue un rôle de catalyseur pour les changements structurels. 
 
II/ Quelle attitude adopter face à l’incertitude ? 
La littérature économique a proposé des orientations en matière de politique monétaire (II/1) 
et diverses approches (II/2) afin de répondre à l’incertitude. 
 
1) Les orientations en matière de politique monétaire 
  
a. Ne pas tenir compte de l’incertitude 
 • Si l’incertitude est liée aux données ou aux chocs (ce que l’on appelle l’incertitude 
« additive »), la solution optimale peut consister à prendre des décisions comme dans un 
environnement exempt d’incertitude. 
 
 • Dans ce cas, d’après le « principe de l’équivalent certain » (Poole, 1970), la politique 
monétaire doit réagir à la meilleure estimation des variables exactement comme elle le ferait 
en présence de variables parfaitement mesurées. 
 
b. Faire preuve de prudence 
• Cette approche a été popularisée par Brainard : l’incertitude « paramétrique » appelle à la 
prudence pour répondre aux perturbations économiques, ce qui plaide en faveur d’une 
approche graduelle (Brainard, 1967). En outre, l’incertitude liée aux « délais de transmission 
longs et variables de la politique monétaire », chers à Milton Friedman, milite contre les 
tentatives de « réglage fin » de l’économie par le biais d’interventions de politique monétaire. 
• En outre, la banque centrale ne doit pas procéder à un ajustement de sa politique monétaire 
uniquement pour répondre aux attentes du marché1 :  
- les marchés de capitaux ont un comportement mimétique alors que les banques centrales 
sont prudentes ; 
- les marchés sont sensibles aux bulles spéculatives alors que les banques centrales se 
concentrent sur les fondamentaux ; 
- l’orientation des marchés est à court terme alors que celle des banques centrales est à moyen 
et long termes. 
• Il arrive cependant que les décisions prises sur les marchés soient erronées, lorsque la 
politique monétaire ne correspond pas à leurs anticipations. La banque centrale doit donc faire 
preuve de cohérence intertemporelle. L’approche habituelle, dans un tel contexte, consiste à 
procéder à une modification progressive du taux directeur. 
• D’un point de vue pratique, l’approche graduelle comporte de nombreux avantages : 
                                                     
1 A. Blinder (1998) 
 
- elle réduit le risque de devoir prendre rapidement des décisions de politique monétaire 
annulant les décisions antérieures ; 
- elle réduit la probabilité de voir des perturbations apparaître sur les marchés de capitaux ; 
- elle est particulièrement adaptée face aux risques majeurs. 
 
Débat concernant d’éventuelles différences de comportement entre l’Eurosystème et la Fed en 
matière de gradualisme 
• Le fait que la zone euro ait adopté en apparence un comportement moins actif que la Fed en 
matière de réduction des taux d’intérêt après 2001 et que ces taux soient restés stables sur une 
période prolongée entre juin 2003 et décembre 2005 a soulevé la question suivante : 
l’Eurosystème est-il « trop passif » ? 
• Activisme et gradualisme se mesurent au nombre et à l’ampleur des modifications du taux 
directeur sur une période donnée. 
• Des études menées récemment à partir d’un modèle estimé pour la zone euro et les États-
Unis sur les vingt dernières années ont abouti aux trois conclusions suivantes2 : 
- les stratégies de politique monétaire mises en œuvre par l’Eurosystème et par la Fed 
présentent effectivement des différences ; 
- le degré de lissage des taux d’intérêt, considéré comme un indicateur du gradualisme 
monétaire, est assez semblable dans la zone euro et aux États-Unis ; 
- les différences concernant les profils d’évolution peuvent être attribuées à des chocs de 
nature et d’ampleur dissemblables, les chocs de demande ayant par exemple été plus 
importants aux États-Unis, appelant par conséquent une réponse plus marquée de politique 
monétaire. 
 
                                                     
2 Motto et Rostagno (2005) et Sahuc et Smets (2006) 
 
Politique monétaire et prix d’actifs 
• La prudence constitue également une réponse appropriée à la question suivante : la politique 
monétaire devrait-elle réagir de façon systématique aux distorsions perçues des prix d’actifs ? 
Trois facteurs d’incertitude doivent être pris en compte : 
- premièrement, l’évaluation de ces distorsions est, par essence, entourée d’un degré élevé 
d’incertitude, lié à la détermination des prix d’équilibre des actifs et à la nature de la 
transmission à l’économie réelle ; 
- deuxièmement, les banques centrales doivent veiller à l’équilibre des risques pesant sur 
l’économie : une mesure de politique monétaire visant à réduire le risque de subir une perte 
importante dans le futur pourrait s’avérer très coûteuse à court terme ; 
- troisièmement, l’incidence des décisions de politique monétaire sur les prix d’actifs est très 
incertaine. 
• L’annonce d’une réaction systématique pourrait donc conduire à une intensification de 
l’aléa moral et nuire à la crédibilité de la banque centrale en matière de lutte contre l’inflation, 
crédibilité qui constitue son atout le plus précieux. En outre, l’unique instrument de taux 
d’intérêt ne peut être dirigé simultanément sur deux objectifs potentiellement contradictoires. 
 
c. Choix d’une stratégie activiste 
Il existe deux cas dans lesquels le gradualisme ne doit pas être adopté de façon systématique : 
• Premièrement, la meilleure façon de prévenir le pire scénario envisageable peut consister à 
suivre des règles de politique monétaire plutôt agressives pour réduire les écarts de l’inflation 
par rapport à l’objectif fixé. 
• Deuxièmement, une règle plus activiste est susceptible d’engendrer davantage 
d’informations, ce qui améliore la somme de connaissances acquises par la banque centrale et 
donc ses performances ultérieures en matière de politique monétaire. Néanmoins, ce 
 
processus d’apprentissage peut s’avérer coûteux dans la mesure où il est à même de conduire 
à une volatilité accrue de l’économie. 
 
2) Quelques approches en vue de faire face à l’incertitude 
 
a) S’appuyer sur de règles de politique monétaire 
 
- Des règles simples de politique monétaire (comme la règle de Taylor) peuvent donner de 
bons résultats pour toute une série de modèles. Une approche reposant sur une règle présente 
également l’avantage de conférer une plus grande prévisibilité à la politique, ce qui facilite la 
formation d’anticipations. 
 
- Toutefois, suivie de façon systématique, une règle risque de ne pas prendre en compte des 
informations pertinentes sur les risques pesant sur la stabilité des prix. Par ailleurs, un 
inconvénient des règles définies de façon trop restreinte tient à leur incapacité à fournir une 
véritable solution à des problèmes complexes. 
 
b) Prêter attention aux événements « de queue de distribution » 
 
- Le souci de maintenir la stabilité du système financier et de contenir le risque systémique 
susceptible d’affecter les marchés de capitaux est au coeur de la mission de la banque 
centrale. Dans un système reposant sur le marché, il est essentiel que l’ensemble des 
opérateurs s’attachent à une saine gestion des risques pour se prémunir contre le danger de 
crise financière lié à un événement de faible probabilité (de queue de distribution). Ces 
pratiques renforcent la stabilité financière sans accroître l’aléa de moralité. Des opérateurs 
 
familiarisés avec les indicateurs de risques, les méthodologies de simulation des crises ou 
« stress-tests » (et les scénarios qui y sont associés) seront plus susceptibles de continuer à 
fournir un accès au crédit en période de crise systémique et institutionnelle. 
 
- Les « stress-tests » utilisent soit des données historiques à partir de distributions des prix 
d’actifs, soit des scénarios hypothétiques donnant des indications sur les risques financiers liés 
aux stratégies de placement et de couverture. Focaliser l’attention des opérateurs de marché 
sur les structures de crise pourrait contribuer à limiter l’incidence d’un événement de queue 
de distribution de probabilité faible mais dont le coût serait particulièrement élevé. 
 
* * * 
 
Je concluerai en expliquant pourquoi j’estime que l’Eurosystème, avec son cadre stratégique, 
est à même de faire face à différents types d’incertitudes. 
 
- Premièrement, l’Eurosystème prend en compte l’incertitude liée aux aléas de transmission 
par l’orientation à moyen terme de sa stratégie de politique monétaire. Il introduit de la 
souplesse dans le processus de prise de décisions et évite de se focaliser sur les évolutions à 
court terme. Le choix de l’horizon à moyen terme constitue également un moyen de concilier 
la politique monétaire et les considérations liées à la stabilité financière, permettant à la 
banque centrale de « voir au-delà de la bulle ». 
 
- Deuxièmement, l’Eurosystème ne s’appuie pas sur un modèle unique concernant le 
processus inflationniste. L’approche à deux piliers reposant sur une double analyse, 
économique et monétaire, procure des informations complémentaires sur les déterminants de 
 
court et moyen termes de l’inflation (analyse économique) et ceux à plus long terme (analyse 
monétaire). L’analyse économique repose sur une vaste gamme d’indicateurs économiques, 
conjoncturels et financiers (données relatives à l’économie réelle et soft data) ainsi que sur 
des prévisions (exercices de projections macroéconomiques des services de l’Eurosystème 
évaluées en parallèle avec les prévisions d’autres institutions). L’analyse monétaire repose sur 
une évaluation exhaustive des conditions de la liquidité et du crédit. Ces deux analyses 
peuvent être recoupées pour fournir une évaluation globale des risques pesant sur la stabilité 
des prix à moyen terme. Des modèles alternatifs du processus d’inflation justifient l’approche 
basée sur des informations exhaustives adoptée par l’Eurosystème en vue de surmonter 
l’incertitude. D’une certaine manière, l’approche à deux piliers repose sur les mêmes 
principes que le traitement de l’incertitude dans un cadre bayésien (Bayesian Model 
Averaging), mais elle est moins formelle. 
 
- Troisièmement, plus l’incertitude est élevée, plus la transparence est nécessaire et plus la 
crédibilité est importante. L’Eurosystème a réussi à ancrer les anticipations d’inflation à un 
niveau très proche de son objectif, témoignant d’un niveau de crédibilité élevé. Malgré des 
prix du pétrole élevés et en hausse, les anticipations d’inflation (mesurées par les points-morts 
d’inflation tirés des obligations indexées) sont restées stables autour de 2% depuis début 2006. 
La crédibilité, qui permet d’ancrer les anticipations d’inflation, contribue à réduire 
l’incertitude relative aux évolutions à venir et à stabiliser l’économie. Les agents économiques 
peuvent ainsi comprendre plus aisément les décisions relatives aux taux d’intérêt à court 
terme et la fonction de réaction de la banque centrale à long terme.

3ième conférence de la Fondation pour la stabilité monétaire 
Francfort-sur-le-Main 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2/11 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
• Je vous remercie de m’avoir invité à cette conférence. C’est un grand plaisir de traiter un 
sujet, « les systèmes financiers et la croissance économique », d’une telle importance tant 
pour les banquiers centraux mais aussi pour tous les agents économiques tant dans les 
économies avancées qu’émergentes. 
• Dans les économies modernes qui nous intéressent ici, les systèmes financiers remplissent 
deux fonctions principales : premièrement, allouer l’épargne aux opportunités 
d’investissement  ; deuxièmement, répartir et allouer le risque entre les différents agents 
économiques. Je traiterai successivement ces deux points avant de conclure par une 
réflexion sur le rôle des banques centrales.

I / - Systèmes financiers, épargne, investissement et croissance économique 
 
Il est communément admis que le développement financier contribue à une plus forte 
croissance économique à long terme. S’agissant de l’affectation de l’épargne à 
l’investissement, la question de savoir si certaines structures financières sont plus efficaces 
que d’autres, est, toutefois, objet de débats. Mon point de vue, pragmatique, me conduit à 
affirmer que les intermédiaires financiers et les marchés doivent être tenus pour 
complémentaires et non comme des canaux pouvant se substituer l’un à l’autre. 
 
A/ - Le développement financier contribue à une plus forte croissance économique à long 
terme 
Des intermédiaires financiers suffisamment développés et des marchés qui fonctionnent de 
manière satisfaisante peuvent stimuler la croissance en améliorant l’efficacité des procédures 
 
3/11 
d’affectation de l’épargne et en accroissant le volume des fonds alloués aux entreprises. En 
particulier, le développement financier rend l’investissement à long terme plus attrayant via 
une mutualisation de  l’épargne ou en favorisant le processus de transformation des liquidités 
et en réduisant les coûts de transaction sur les marchés. En outre, un meilleur suivi des 
emprunteurs conduit à une allocation plus efficace des ressources. Par ailleurs, l’amélioration 
de la répartition du risque peut faire progresser le taux d’épargne et encourager les projets 
innovants. 
Les études, notamment empiriques, montrent clairement que le développement financier a une 
influence positive prononcée sur la croissance économique1 :  
• en particulier, le développement financier peut améliorer la croissance de la 
productivité, encourageant ainsi une progression soutenue de l’activité 
économique à long terme. Les jeunes entreprises des secteurs innovants et à 
forte productivité sont généralement plus dépendantes des financements 
externes que les entreprises bien établies. De ce fait, elles profitent davantage 
d’un système financier développé2 ; 
• ainsi, en améliorant l’efficacité de l’investissement, le développement du 
système financier soutient et encourage l’essor économique. Le cas de la 
Chine montre bien que la modernisation du système financier peut favoriser 
une croissance plus équilibrée et plus soutenable à long terme en évitant le 
surinvestissement, en facilitant la réduction de l’épargne constituée aux fins de 
retraite et en stimulant la consommation.

B/ - Structure financière et croissance économique 
Comme je l’ai évoqué auparavant, affecter l’épargne à l’investissement est une fonction 
centrale des systèmes financiers mais il existe de nombreuses manières de réaliser cette 
affectation. Une distinction fondamentale peut être établie entre deux catégories de 
systèmes financiers : ceux où les banques et les autres intermédiaires financiers jouent un 
rôle dominant ; ceux où le processus de rapprochement entre épargne et besoins 
d’investissement s’effectue par l’échange d’actifs ou d’instruments sur les marchés 
financiers. Au cours des dernières décennies, les marchés financiers, ont joué un rôle 
croissant dans l’affectation de l’épargne dans les économies industrialisées, et plus 
récemment dans les économies émergentes. Ce processus, communément dénommé 
désintermédiation, a-t-il accru ou au contraire réduit l’efficacité des marchés financiers ? 
En d’autres termes, existe-t-il une forme « supérieure » de structure financière, i.e. une 
combinaison optimale entre intermédiaires et marchés financiers pour favoriser la 
croissance économique à long terme ? Ce « débat, vieux d’un siècle » selon Ross Levine, a 
reçu des réponses contradictoires3 : 
• selon la thèse favorable aux « intermédiaires », les banques ont une action plus 
stimulante sur la croissance que les marchés, en particulier au cours des 
premières étapes du développement économique, parce qu'elles sont plus 
performantes dans le suivi des entreprises et mieux à même de réduire l’aléa 
moral. Selon la thèse en faveur des « marchés », ceux-ci sont notamment plus 
aptes que les banques à financer des projets innovants ou à risque élevé. 
• dans ce contexte, il peut être tentant d’établir un lien entre l’accélération de la 
croissance de la productivité observée aux États-Unis à partir du milieu des

années quatre-vingt-dix, en phase avec les fortes progressions de la 
production, l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information et de la 
communication, et le système financier américain, essentiellement fondé sur le 
marché. Dans le même temps, on a observé un ralentissement de la 
productivité dans deux grandes régions où les banques jouent un rôle 
dominant, l’Europe et le Japon. 
• toutefois, certaines études empiriques soutiennent qu’une distinction entre 
pays reposant sur la structure du système financier ne permet pas d’expliquer 
les différences de croissance économique à long terme4. Ce qui importe en fait 
pour la croissance, c’est le niveau global et la qualité des services financiers 
fournis par l’ensemble du système financier et non sa structure. En particulier, 
les systèmes juridiques et réglementaires jouent un rôle déterminant dans 
l’émergence de services financiers favorables à la croissance. 
 
En résumé, je partage le point de vue selon lequel la structure du système financier ne semble 
pas déterminante pour la croissance. Nous devrions considérer les intermédiaires financiers et 
les marchés comme des composantes complémentaires d’un système diversifié et complet 
d’intermédiation financière. 
 
• La concurrence pour l’affectation des flux et des risques financiers améliore l'efficacité de 
l'économie. La concurrence financière s’exerce dans trois domaines :  
(1) au sein du système des intermédiaires (banques, OPCVM, compagnies 
d’assurance…) ; 
(2)  entre les intermédiaires et les marchés d’un même pays ; 
 
6/11 
(3) et entre systèmes financiers nationaux. 
• Les intermédiaires financiers sont également des opérateurs-clés du marché. Ils contribuent 
au fonctionnement efficace des marchés. Les banques, notamment, sont les fournisseurs 
finals de la liquidité, fonction primordiale en temps ordinaire et qui peut devenir cruciale 
en périodes de tensions.  
• C’est pourquoi un système financier diversifié peut faciliter l’absorption des chocs, et dans 
les circonstances les plus extrêmes, limiter les conséquences d’une crise financière. De 
telles crises se sont produites dans des pays dotés de structures financières différentes, ce 
qui laisse penser que l’organisation spécifique du système financier n’intervient pas. 
Néanmoins, permettez-moi de citer Alan Greenspan selon lequel «  dans une économie 
donnée, les multiples possibilités de convertir l’épargne en investissement, constituent des 
solutions de repli en cas d’échec de la forme primaire d’intermédiation. En 1998 aux États-
Unis, le système bancaire a remplacé les marchés de capitaux. Bien plus souvent, c’est le 
contraire qui se produit […]. ». 
 
II / Systèmes financiers, répartition des risques et croissance économique 
 
L’une des principales fonctions d’un système financier consiste à répartir les risques entre les 
différents agents économiques. Grâce à cette répartition, les emprunteurs peuvent adapter 
leurs profils de risque et bénéficier, par conséquent, d’un meilleur accès aux capitaux. Les 
épargnants sont mieux à même de diversifier et de gérer leur portefeuille. L’allocation 
efficace des capitaux qui résulte d’un meilleur partage des risques est incontestablement à 
l’origine de gains pour l’économie. Par exemple, les projets à rendements élevés (et 
innovants), souvent plus risqués, seront mieux financés. Pour les investisseurs, une gestion

efficace du risque peut améliorer leur capacité à détenir des portefeuilles composés d’actifs 
risqués tout en réduisant, dans le même temps, leur exposition globale par le biais de la 
diversification. 
 
A/ Partage du risque et innovation financière 
 
Au cours des trente dernières années, les systèmes financiers ont connu de profondes 
mutations. Les innovations financières, le développement des marchés de produits dérivés et 
la titrisation des actifs permettent aux intermédiaires d’améliorer la diversification des risques 
et leur gestion. 
 
Ainsi, les produits financiers dérivés ont révolutionné les marchés internationaux de capitaux. 
L’émergence de vastes marchés pour les contrats à terme de gré à gré (forward), les contrats à 
terme d’instruments financiers (futures), les options, les swaps et autres produits dérivés, a 
modifié de façon significative la conduite des activités d’emprunt, d’investissement et la 
gestion du risque. Les principaux avantages économiques des produits financiers dérivés sont 
les suivants :  
a)  fractionnement et transfert des risques,  
b)  possibilité de couvrir les risques liés aux prix des actifs et de réaliser  
des opérations synthétiques avec une plus grande efficacité et des coûts plus faibles,  
c)  liquidité accrue et négociation facilitée des actifs financiers. 
 
J’ai la ferme conviction que le processus d’innovation sur les marchés va se poursuivre dans 
les dix ans à venir. Tout d’abord, parce que l’innovation est une caractéristique naturelle des

marchés financiers modernes. Le développement des dérivés de crédit ces cinq dernières 
années illustre la rapidité avec laquelle des instruments peuvent se développer et gagner en 
importance. Ensuite, parce que les marchés sont encore incomplets, dans le sens où certains 
risques ne peuvent pas être couverts ou transférés de manière efficace dans le contexte actuel.  
 
B/ Marchés incomplets et risques intergénérationnels 
 
Le risque démographique, plus généralement, le transfert efficace du risque entre les 
générations (risque intergénérationnel), constitue un exemple intéressant pour les décideurs. 
Actuellement, les marchés ne semblent pas être réellement équipés pour traiter 
convenablement le risque intergénérationnel i.e. celui touchant simultanément les différentes 
générations coexistant dans une société.  
 
De nombreux pays développés traversent actuellement une phase de transition 
démographique, liée au vieillissement de la population. Ainsi, d’après un rapport de la 
Banque mondiale de 1994, en 2030, 1,4 milliard de personnes dans le monde auront plus de 
60 ans, contre seulement 500 millions en 1990. Nous sommes donc dans une période de 
transition vers une économie comptant beaucoup plus de personnes âgées à charge par rapport 
à la population active.  Je pense que le vieillissement de la population va nous inciter à 
inventer des institutions pour faire face à ce type de risque ou, peut-être, à créer des produits 
d’investissement supplémentaires et mieux adaptés à la nouvelle donne. Par exemple, 
l’allongement de l’espérance de vie pourrait entraîner des risques qui ne sont pas couverts de 
manière efficace sur les marchés financiers ou qui sont difficiles à gérer par les ménages.  
 
 
9/11 
Au-delà de la question purement démographique, certains risques pourraient être partagés 
plus efficacement entre les générations. Dans son récent et très intéressant livre intitulé The 
new financial order, Robert Schiller propose d’étendre les principes de la gestion financière 
afin « d’y inclure la société toute entière ». Il préconise, par exemple, la création de « macro-
marchés » sur lesquels se négocieraient des créances à long terme sur les revenus nationaux et 
les revenus du travail ainsi que des actifs peu liquides tels que les biens immobiliers. L’une de 
ses idées les plus stimulantes est celle d’une « sécurité sociale intergénérationnelle »  qui 
permettra de combler le vide actuel. En effet, les régimes de retraite par répartition qui 
existent actuellement ne partagent pas les risques entre les générations. De fait, les risques liés 
aux revenus des retraités sont transférés sur les personnes en activité et leurs enfants. Ceux-ci 
supportent ainsi les risques de deux générations. La composante essentielle de la « sécurité 
sociale intergénérationnelle » consisterait à mutualiser les risques supportés par les différentes 
générations, y compris les risques macroéconomiques.  
 
C/ Innovation et risque 
 
Doit-on s’inquiéter de la rapidité du processus d’innovation ou, en d’autres termes, comme l’a 
dit R. Rajan, « les évolutions financières ont-elles rendu le monde plus risqué » ? Si l’on 
adopte une vision positive, les innovations financières ont amélioré l’efficience et accru la 
résistance du système financier. Les risques sont répartis entre un plus grand nombre 
d’agents, qui sont désireux de les prendre et qui ont la capacité de le faire. Les intermédiaires 
financiers reçoivent des incitations suffisantes pour améliorer leurs techniques de gestion des 
risques. Le système financier est donc mieux à même d’absorber les chocs sans accentuer leur 
impact sur l’économie.  
 
 
10/11 
De manière générale, ce point de vue me semble juste. Le système financier a fait face de 
façon remarquable, et en montrant très peu de signes d’instabilité, aux divers épisodes de 
désordres financiers et aux chocs de ces dernières années. Les difficultés de fonctionnement 
du marché ont été temporaires et l’incidence de ces épisodes sur les économies réelles des 
pays industrialisés a été généralement limitée.  
 
Toutefois, il convient de s’assurer que les institutions financières et les marchés contribuent 
efficacement à absorber et à répartir les chocs qui surviennent dans l’économie réelle. En tout 
état de cause, ils ne devraient pas constituer une source supplémentaire de choc. À cet égard, 
les responsables de la politique économique doivent se poser deux questions. La première 
concerne tout simplement notre capacité à comprendre ce qui se passe dans le système 
financier lorsque les innovations ajoutent en permanence de nouveaux niveaux de 
sophistication et de complexité. Comme cela est souvent le cas avec les innovations 
financières, évaluer le risque qu’elles impliquent nécessite le recours à des techniques 
complexes qui ne sont pas toujours suffisamment éprouvées et testées, faute de modèles 
adéquats ou de manque de profondeur des données disponibles. La deuxième question, 
soulevée par Rajan, porte sur les incitations, sujet rendu crucial par le passage d’une 
intermédiation assurée par les dépositaires à une gestion professionnelle des actifs. Le régime 
d’incitations dans le cadre duquel opèrent les gestionnaires devrait être aligné, de façon étroite 
et en permanence, avec les intérêts des investisseurs. De mon point de vue, il s’agit d’un axe 
de recherche très prometteur pour les universitaires mais également fort intéressant pour les 
autorités réglementaires. 
 
* 
*      *. 
 
11/11 
 
Permettez-moi de conclure en évoquant deux points qui concernent les banques centrales.  
 
Premièrement, les banques centrales s’intéressent, par nature, à l’efficacité et à la stabilité du 
système financier. Les prix des actifs sont un canal fondamental pour la transmission de la 
politique monétaire à l’économie réelle. La capacité du système financier à absorber les chocs 
sans heurt a été favorisée par des politiques monétaires prévisibles et transparentes dans de 
nombreux pays. Une inflation stable et peu élevée a contribué à réduire la sensibilité du 
système financier aux chocs. 
Deuxièmement, les banques centrales doivent, pour cette raison, suivre attentivement le 
processus d’innovation financière. Afin de renforcer la transparence, il conviendrait de 
combiner différentes approches, faisant intervenir tant le secteur public que le secteur privé, 
telles que :  
a) le perfectionnement des normes financières et de la réglementation prudentielle,  
b) une amélioration de la collecte de données relatives aux marchés de gré  
 à gré (obligations, produits dérivés),  
c) des efforts pour favoriser une meilleure diffusion des informations de la part  
 des institutions financières,  
d) la promotion d’une discipline de marché plus forte.  
 
Je suis profondément convaincu que cela peut être réalisé sans entraver l’efficience et la 
souplesse de la finance moderne, si importante pour notre croissance et notre prospérité 
future.

DU PREMIER FORUM FINANCIER FRANCO-CHINOIS

Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir de m’exprimer ce matin devant vous, et d’apporter mon 
plein soutien, aux côtés du Gouverneur ZHOU et de la Banque du Peuple de 
Chine, à ce 1er Forum financier franco-chinois organisé aujourd’hui à Pékin. 
 
Je suis convaincu que cette journée permettra un large dialogue entre les 
communautés financières de nos deux pays. Nous souhaitons en effet 
encourager une coopération entre tous les acteurs financiers chinois et français, 
banques centrales et régulateurs bien sûr, mais aussi entre fédérations 
professionnelles, entreprises financières, ainsi qu’entre universitaires. Il ne doit 
pas s’agir de discussions d’un jour. Je vous encourage au contraire à renforcer 
aujourd’hui les liens déjà existants d’une coopération nourrie et de long terme. 
 
J’articulerai mon propos autour de trois axes principaux : le premier, 
l’importance d’un système financier développé et performant pour 
accompagner la croissance économique ; le deuxième, les conditions d’un 
développement financier réussi ; le troisième, la coopération et le rôle que 
peuvent jouer les acteurs français et européens dans ce processus en Chine. 
 
* 
Ce premier Forum sino-français intervient à une période déterminante de 
l’histoire économique et financière de la Chine. L’insertion de celle-ci dans 
le commerce mondial a progressé de façon spectaculaire. La Chine s’est 
également ouverte aux flux de capitaux. Elle est aujourd’hui au cœur de 
nombreux débats économiques et financiers internationaux.  
 
La France et la Chine partagent des expériences similaires. En effet, la finance 
française a vécu, dans un passé encore récent, les mêmes transformations que 
 3
celles que traverse désormais la finance chinoise : la dérégulation financière, 
l’ouverture et la privatisation du système bancaire, la désintermédiation et le 
développement des marchés financiers, l’ouverture progressive aux 
mouvements internationaux de capitaux. 
 
La Chine a en effet besoin de développer plus largement son propre marché des 
capitaux, à la fois pour sélectionner les meilleurs projets d’investissement, 
répartir le risque entre les différents agents, et offrir aux épargnants chinois des 
placements sûrs et liquides. Une meilleure rémunération de l’épargne 
contribuerait à accroître les revenus consacrés à la consommation des ménages 
chinois, leur permettant d’améliorer leur bien-être, tout en stimulant la 
production et la croissance économique. Ce développement doit aller de pair 
avec l’ouverture du système financier chinois sur l’extérieur. Je dirais même 
que cette ouverture est indissociable du développement sain du système 
financier. Elle seule est, en effet, le gage d’une adoption rapide des normes 
internationales en matière financière. Davantage de concurrence pour 
l’affectation des flux et des risques financiers améliore l’efficacité de 
l’économie dans son ensemble. Cette concurrence doit s’exercer non seulement 
entre intermédiaires et marchés financiers d’un même pays, mais aussi entre 
acteurs locaux et étrangers, et plus largement entre systèmes financiers 
nationaux. En pratique, la présence d’acteurs financiers non-résidents me paraît 
constituer un aiguillon essentiel au bon fonctionnement du système financier 
chinois. Elle contribue à élargir et améliorer l’offre de placements et de 
financements pour les investisseurs chinois. 
 
* 
Pour autant, le développement et une plus grande ouverture du système 
financier ne doivent pas se faire de manière désordonnée ou précipitée. A 
 4
cet égard, j’apprécie tout particulièrement le concept promu par le Gouverneur 
ZHOU d’« écologie financière ». Et, je considère comme fondamental le rôle 
joué par les banques centrales dans la protection de l’« écosystème » financier. 
Les banques centrales s’intéressent, par nature, à l’efficacité et à la stabilité du 
système financier. Garantir la santé de cet « écosystème » nécessite une 
surveillance et une amélioration continues tant des rouages financiers, que de 
l’environnement général des affaires. Il s’agit du cadre légal et comptable bien 
sûr, étant entendu que celui-ci doit être appliqué. Il doit garantir la sécurité 
juridique des opérations financières, en particulier concernant l’encadrement 
des faillites. L’information sur les contreparties doit être sincère. Il importe 
également que les intermédiaires, financiers ou autres, soient solides et 
l’appareil statistique performant. Plus généralement, une forte discipline de 
marché est nécessaire.  
 
Les améliorations internes requises vont de pair avec l’adaptation du 
système financier chinois aux évolutions financières internationales. Nous 
assistons actuellement à des changements structurels notables au sein du 
secteur bancaire chinois. En parallèle, la volonté forte des autorités chinoises de 
construire un système de supervision robuste et un cadre réglementaire clair 
sont essentiels pour promouvoir les participations étrangères. Ces efforts, tant 
en matière réglementaire (sur le contrôle interne des banques, sur la prise en 
compte des risques opérationnels et de marché), qu’en matière de supervision 
(le renforcement des procédures d’inspection sur place et de la surveillance sur 
pièces), peuvent être vus comme un souhait et une volonté de la part de la 
Chine de se conformer aux meilleures pratiques et normes internationales. Dans 
cette perspective, et comme l’a fait la France, un examen de la Chine selon le 
« Financial Stability Assessment Program » du FMI et de la Banque mondiale 
serait un nouveau signal important. Ceci d’autant plus que la Chine a 
 5
activement participé à la révision des principes fondamentaux pour un contrôle 
bancaire efficace, qui sera officiellement présentée à la Conférence 
Internationale des Contrôleurs Bancaires (ICBS) en octobre prochain à Merida.  
 
De même, la promotion d’une forte culture en suivi et contrôle de gestion du 
risque au sein même des institutions financières peut être réalisée rapidement 
en bénéficiant des pratiques des banques les plus performantes sur la scène 
internationale, notamment dans les domaines clés que sont la gouvernance 
d’entreprise, le contrôle interne, la mesure et la gestion des risques. A cet égard, 
la mise en œuvre effective du nouveau dispositif d’adéquation des fonds 
propres, Bâle II, est un défi clé à la fois pour les banques résidents et non 
résidentes. Il implique notamment des liens renforcés entre superviseurs 
chinois et étrangers, dans le contexte du dialogue entre pays d’origine et pays 
d’accueil (« home-host dialogue »). Ceci est particulièrement important pour la 
France, car nos grandes banques présentes en Chine vont adopter l’approche la 
plus avancée permise par Bâle II, pour évaluer et gérer les risques de crédit, les 
risques de marché et le risque opérationnel. 
 
Comme vous le voyez la tâche est lourde, et construire un tel 
« écosystème » ne peut être le fruit que d’un processus de moyen terme. 
Enormément a déjà été fait par les autorités chinoises, dans un temps court ; 
mais beaucoup reste encore à faire pour éviter toute déconvenue. Bien sûr, une 
réforme brutale n’est de l’intérêt ni de la Chine, ni du reste du monde. Nous 
observons avec intérêt l’approche graduelle et séquencée adoptée par les 
autorités chinoises. Approche graduelle ne veut pas dire pour autant 
immobilisme. Les réformes récentes montrent bien la détermination de la Chine 
à avancer : accroissement progressif de la flexibilité du régime de change ; 
ouverture progressive des marchés financiers aux étrangers dans le cadre des 
 6
licences QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors) ; lancement récent des 
QDII (Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors), autant de signes très 
encourageants. Les flux entrants et sortants générés par les investisseurs 
qualifiés (environ 10 Milliards USD dans les deux sens) sont encore d’ampleur 
limitée. J’espère que les volumes concernés s’accroîtront rapidement. 
 
De même, conformément au calendrier de l’Organisation Mondiale du 
Commerce (OMC), la Chine a accru l’ouverture de son système financier. Que 
ce soit pour les banques ou les sociétés d’assurance, le territoire chinois est de 
plus en plus largement accessible aux étrangers. En retour, les récentes 
initiatives prises par les grandes institutions financières internationales 
montrent que les banques étrangères ont réagi de manière très positive à ces 
changements stratégiques. Les banques françaises ne doivent pas rester à l’écart 
de ces développements. Les efforts en cours pour homogénéiser les 
réglementations des marchés financiers en Chine doivent aussi recevoir une 
grande attention de notre part, car elles constituent l’épine dorsale de nombre 
d’activités développées par les banques françaises. Enfin, bien sûr, dans moins 
de trois mois, les services bancaires aux particuliers seront juridiquement 
ouverts aux étrangers. Nous suivons ce mouvement avec une grande attention. 
 
* 
 
Dans ce processus, les acteurs étrangers, et particulièrement les acteurs 
français et européens, peuvent apporter une aide précieuse, pour le 
bénéfice de tous.  
 
La coopération entre autorités financières chinoises et françaises est déjà une 
réalité. Nous avons par exemple signé un accord de coopération (memorandum 
 7
of understanding) avec la China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) l’an 
dernier. Les échanges avec nos collègues de la PBoC et de la CBRC sont 
nourris et continus, que ce soit à Pékin, à Paris, ou à l’occasion des réunions 
internationales. A l’image de cette coopération institutionnelle, il importe aussi 
que les autres acteurs de nos deux industries financières coopèrent activement. 
Je souhaite donc que cette journée de rencontres soit l’occasion pour les acteurs 
financiers de nos deux pays, de mieux connaître les spécificités et les talents 
des uns et des autres. 
 
La place de Paris a beaucoup à offrir. Ses membres sont source pour les 
entreprises chinoises de transferts de connaissances techniques et de bonnes 
pratiques. Elle a connu de très bonnes performances au cours des dernières 
années, reflétées par la hausse significative de la capitalisation boursière, la 
présence croissante des investisseurs étrangers et l’activité très soutenue des 
activités de gestion d’actifs. Permettez-moi d’en souligner quelques aspects : 
 
- dans un contexte de concurrence internationale accrue, la bourse 
paneuropéenne Euronext (qui regroupe Paris, Amsterdam, Bruxelles et 
Lisbonne) a renforcé ses infrastructures, tout en recevant plusieurs propositions 
importantes de rapprochement avec d’autres entreprises de marché. Le 
lancement en 2005 d’Alternext, un marché non réglementé destiné à la cotation 
des petites et moyennes entreprises, est déjà un succès. Une entreprise chinoise 
y prévoit même sa cotation avant la fin de l’année. Alors qu’elle possède déjà 
le Liffe, principal marché à terme mondial, Euronext a plus récemment acquis 
la plateforme MTS dans le cadre d’un joint venture avec Borsa Italiana. Il 
s’agit là de la principale plateforme européenne d’échanges en gros de titres 
d’Etat. 
 
 8
- la place de Paris a aussi fourni une contribution décisive au lancement du 
label commun pour les marchés européens à court terme (STEP), un pas 
notable vers des marchés européens pleinement intégrés. La France demeure un 
marché dominant pour les titres à court terme. Elle occupe le premier rang pour 
les titres libellés en euros avec un volume de 350 Milliards d’euros. 
 
- la place de Paris dispose bien sûr de banques de premier rang, tant au plan 
européen que mondial. Ces banques s’appuient sur de bons business models sur 
leur marché domestique, à la fois variés et stables. Cette base solide leur permet 
ainsi une forte internationalisation. Elles jouissent d’une rentabilité forte et en 
croissance régulière. De plus, le ratio de solvabilité des principaux groupes 
bancaires se situe à un niveau élevé (plus de 8% de tier 1 en moyenne), 
démontrant la solidité de leurs structures financières. Je note aussi qu’elles 
comptent parmi les leaders mondiaux en matière de gestion d’actifs et 
d’opérations sur instruments financiers dérivés. Surtout, ces entreprises 
jouissent d’une expertise et d’une capacité d’innovation unanimement 
reconnues, qui vont de pair avec la mise en œuvre d’approches avancées en 
matière de mesure et de contrôle des risques. 
 
Certains champs d’expertise de l’industrie financière française m’apparaissent 
particulièrement pertinents dans le contexte chinois : des liens historiques 
étroits avec le secteur public, une expérience avérée de l’exercice des métiers 
de la banque et de l’assurance en milieu rural, des réseaux coopératifs puissants 
tant dans le domaine bancaire que de celui de l’assurance. Autant d’exemples 
utiles pour les réformateurs chinois, d’occasions de coopération entre nos deux 
industries financières. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

« Les agrégats monétaires ont-ils de l’importance ? Une perspective 
européenne » 
 
9 novembre 2006 
 
4ème Conférence des banques centrales  
« Le rôle de la monnaie : la monnaie et la politique monétaire au vingt-et-unième siècle » 
 
Francfort-sur-le-Main, 9-10 novembre 2006 
 
 
 
C’est un grand plaisir et un honneur pour moi d’intervenir ici dans le cadre de la Conférence 
des banques centrales. 
Mon intervention sera structurée de la façon suivante : je passerai tout d’abord en revue un 
certain nombre de faits stylisés sur la monnaie et l’inflation qui montrent que le rôle des 
agrégats monétaires reste essentiel ; ensuite, je rapporterai ces faits stylisés aux deux piliers de 
la stratégie de politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème. En conclusion, j’évoquerai certains défis 
intéressants auxquels nous sommes confrontés lors de la mise en œuvre de notre analyse 
monétaire.  
 
Quelques faits stylisés sur la monnaie et l’inflation 
 
Permettez-moi de commencer par un paradoxe bien connu qui peut s’articuler autour de trois 
propositions.  Premièrement, la stabilité des prix est l’objectif de toutes les banques centrales ; 
deuxièmement, comme l’a dit Milton Friedman « l’inflation est toujours et partout un 
phénomène monétaire » ; et troisièmement, dans la plupart des pays, les agrégats monétaires 
ne jouent toutefois qu’un rôle mineur, voire aucun rôle dans l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre 
de la politique monétaire.  
 
 2
Bien sûr, une exception notable existe : il s’agit de la zone euro. Avant de vous présenter 
notre approche de façon plus détaillée, je souhaiterais citer deux raisons qui me poussent à 
penser que la monnaie, en tant que telle, reste une composante essentielle pour l’élaboration et 
la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire. 
 
 Premièrement, la monnaie continue de revêtir un intérêt direct pour la politique 
monétaire dans des circonstances exceptionnelles : forte inflation (ou hyperinflation) 
ou déflation. C’est en fixant un plafond à la croissance de la monnaie de banque 
centrale que Paul Volcker a ramené l’inflation américaine de 13 % à 3 % en trois ans. 
Inversement, lorsque les autorités japonaises ont dû lutter contre la déflation, elles ont 
recouru à une politique d’ « assouplissement quantitatif », ce qui signifie 
fondamentalement qu’elles s’étaient fixé un objectif spécifique de monnaie de banque 
centrale. Les fondements théoriques de ces politiques ont été très largement débattus : 
notamment, la question de savoir si un canal spécifique de transmission de la politique 
monétaire, indépendamment des taux d’intérêt, peut être identifié. En tout cas, ces 
expériences montrent, à mes yeux, que la fixation d’une trajectoire d’évolution de la 
croissance monétaire (ou de son niveau) peut s’avérer très efficace pour maîtriser les 
anticipations -ou stabiliser le niveau des prix- dans un environnement extrême.  
 Dans des circonstances plus normales toutefois, la relation entre masse monétaire et 
prix est plus subtile et incertaine. Dans les économies modernes, la demande de 
monnaie fait état –au moins à court et moyen termes– d’une certaine instabilité 
chronique, voire même d’imprévisibilité, point sur lequel je reviendrai plus tard. Cela 
a conduit à la disparition des agrégats monétaires en tant que cibles de la politique 
monétaire et, dans certains pays, ils ont également été abandonnés en tant 
qu’indicateurs.   
 
Mais, dans la zone euro, nous continuons de penser qu’à très long terme, Friedman a raison. 
Nos études ont établi que les mouvements de basse fréquence de la croissance monétaire et  
l’inflation sont étroitement corrélés, la fenêtre de lissage choisie permettant de retenir les 
fluctuations sur une période de 8 à 10 ans. De notre point de vue, cela s’explique par le fait 
que la monnaie peut exercer une influence directe sur la production et l’inflation, en 
particulier en raison des frictions monétaires et financières existant dans l’économie et 
également d’une certaine rigidité dans le processus de formation des prix. 
 
 3
Ces éléments sous-tendent l’approche à deux piliers de l’Eurosystème 
 
Comme vous le savez, la stratégie de politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème repose sur deux 
piliers : l’analyse économique d’une part et l’analyse monétaire d’autre part. Une large 
gamme d’indicateurs à court terme (analyse économique) sont complétés par les déterminants 
à plus long terme de l’inflation (analyse monétaire). Ce dispositif repose sur une hypothèse et 
a une implication importante.  
 
Nous supposons que même si la monnaie n’a pas d’influence systématique et immédiate sur 
les prix, elle peut fournir des informations précieuses et spécifiques sur l’inflation future, à 
des horizons allant au-delà de ceux généralement retenus pour l’élaboration des projections 
d’inflation des banques centrales. Étant donné la relation à long terme entre croissance 
monétaire et inflation, la monnaie possède des propriétés d’indicateur avancé sur l’évolution 
future des prix.  On pourrait nous objecter qu’il ne s’agit que d’un « argument empirique ». 
Mais, pour les banques centrales, les réalités empiriques jouent un rôle important. On pourrait 
également concevoir que d’autres stratégies reposant sur une cible du niveau des prix ou d’un 
niveau moyen d’inflation à long terme recouvrent les mêmes propriétés stabilisantes qu’une 
norme de croissance monétaire. Je ne le conteste pas en théorie. Mais je ne suis pas sûr que 
ces stratégies seraient plus facile à mettre en œuvre ou permettraient d’ancrer les anticipations 
d’inflation de la même façon.  
 
D’où la nécessité de recouper l’information relative aux tensions inflationnistes et aux risques 
pesant sur la stabilité des prix ; pour procéder à ce recoupement, nous devons regrouper et 
comparer différentes stratégies analytiques et utiliser de manière systématique toutes les 
informations nécessaires au processus de décision.  
 
Bien entendu, la politique monétaire ne réagit pas mécaniquement aux évolutions monétaires 
mais plutôt aux informations contenues dans les agrégats monétaires qui sont importantes 
pour le maintien de la stabilité des prix à moyen terme. Il s’agit là du fondement de la 
définition d’une « valeur de référence » pour les agrégats monétaires.  
 
Le pilier monétaire soutient une approche de la politique monétaire sous l’angle de la gestion 
de risques. Il permet une évaluation et une identification précoces des déséquilibres potentiels. 
 4
Il met en lumière ces risques sur un horizon temporel plus long que celui habituellement 
retenu par la politique monétaire, mais néanmoins pertinent pour l’objectif final de stabilité 
des prix.  
 
Cet aspect revêt une importance toute particulière lorsque des déséquilibres financiers se 
forment au sein de l’économie, alimentés par un excès de croissance de la monnaie ou de la 
liquidité. La résorption de ces déséquilibres peut être brutale et discontinue, ce que l’on 
qualifie parfois d’« ajustement non linéaire », et donc très déstabilisante. Les données 
empiriques indiquent que les envolées de prix d’actifs se sont généralement produites lorsque 
la croissance de la monnaie et du crédit étaient supérieures à leur moyenne de long terme. 
Quels que soient les objectifs finaux et la fonction de perte des banques centrales, toutes 
s’accordent à reconnaître que la politique monétaire ne doit pas contribuer volontairement à la 
formation de ces phases de flambée du crédit, et des prix d’actifs. 
 
Toutefois, pour utiliser au mieux le contenu en information de la monnaie, il nous faut 
relever de nombreux défis de plus en plus importants. 
 
Une difficulté majeure consiste à identifier en temps réel la nature des évolutions monétaires 
et leurs conséquences pour l’évolution des prix. Le défi pour l’analyse monétaire réside dans 
sa capacité à éliminer le bruit des données monétaires afin d’en extraire les tendances sous-
jacentes pertinentes pour les décisions de politique monétaire. Cela n’a pas été chose facile 
ces dernières années, dans la mesure où la zone euro a subi plusieurs chocs : instabilité 
financière après le recul important des marchés boursiers en 2000, degré exceptionnellement 
élevé d’incertitude économique et géopolitique de 2001 à 2003, pour n’en citer que quelques-
uns.  
 
En tout premier lieu, les chocs transitoires influent souvent sur les évolutions monétaires à 
court terme. Il nous faut identifier et tenir compte de ces « facteurs spéciaux » ou 
« distorsions » temporaires qui sont susceptibles d’affecter les évolutions monétaires et de 
brouiller les informations qu’elles contiennent. C’est, dans une certaine mesure, ce qu’a pour 
objectif la méthodologie développée par la BCE, qui intègre des ajustements périodiques des 
agrégats monétaires. Ces derniers sont en effet corrigés des choix de portefeuille ayant une 
 5
incidence sur la demande de monnaie mais pas sur l’inflation future. Cette approche a connu 
un grand succès entre 2000 et 2004. 
 
En second lieu, et de façon plus permanente, il est nécessaire de distinguer, au sein des 
évolutions de la monnaie et du crédit, celles qui reflètent des changements structurels et 
durables de celles qui résultent d’une variation du niveau des taux d’intérêt ou de la phase du 
cycle économique. Dans ce cas, aucune approche mécanique ou ad hoc ne convient. Il nous 
faut examiner les déterminants fondamentaux de la demande de monnaie. Dans l’idéal, nous 
devrions disposer d’un modèle complet et détaillé des arbitrages et des choix de portefeuille 
ce qui, au demeurant, permettrait de déterminer la demande de monnaie. Nous sommes encore 
loin d’avoir construit un modèle de ce type.  
 
Nous pouvons aussi faire appel à notre intuition. Partons du fait que la monnaie est à la fois 
un substitut et un complément des actifs financiers. Dans la mesure où la monnaie est 
substituable, la demande de monnaie dépend de la variation des rendements relatifs, c’est-à-
dire des mouvements effectifs et anticipés de taux d’intérêt. Mais la monnaie est également un 
complément des actifs financiers et, de ce fait, réagit à des modifications durables en termes 
d’offre, de disponibilité et de caractéristiques de ces actifs. La « financiarisation » de nos 
économies s’accroît, au sens où le ratio de richesse financière par rapport au PIB est en 
progression constante. Dans la mesure où les agents financiers, en particulier les 
intermédiaires financiers et les entreprises, ont besoin de conserver une partie de leurs actifs 
financiers sous forme d’avoirs liquides, il se peut que nous assistions à une hausse structurelle 
de la demande de monnaie, toutes choses égales par ailleurs. L’euro et l’intégration des 
marchés européens de capitaux ont sans doute accéléré cette évolution. 
 
Cela permettrait d’expliquer la rupture de tendance observée dans la zone euro en 2000 et en 
2001 concernant la vitesse de circulation de la monnaie. En effet, depuis 2001, celle-ci 
diminue de 3,5 % par an, soit nettement plus vite que le taux retenu dans le calcul de la valeur 
de référence.  
 
Selon une interprétation possible, cette évolution résulte de deux chocs consécutifs : un choc 
temporaire de demande entre 2000 et 2004, sous l’effet essentiellement des réaménagements 
de portefeuille et, depuis 2004, un choc d’offre, c’est-à-dire une augmentation des actifs 
 6
liquides en raison de la baisse du coût d’opportunité de la détention de monnaie dans un 
contexte de niveau historiquement bas des taux d’intérêt.  
 
Cependant, le fait que cette situation dure maintenant depuis 2001 peut donner lieu à une 
autre explication, à savoir que la rupture de tendance observée à l’époque revêt un caractère 
structurel. Des travaux économétriques menés actuellement à la Banque de France confirment 
cette situation. La forte baisse des taux d’intérêt a bien évidemment joué un rôle. Néanmoins, 
nos calculs économétriques semblent montrer que celle-ci ne représente qu’une très petite part 
de la rupture de tendance observée depuis 2001. Il se peut donc que nous assistions à une 
croissance permanente de la demande de monnaie.  
 
La progression beaucoup plus rapide, ces dernières années, des encaisses monétaires des 
entreprises et des institutions financières par rapport à celles des ménages corrobore cette 
hypothèse. La croissance de la monnaie et du crédit pourrait donc avoir un facteur commun : 
la « financiarisation » et le poids croissant des actifs financiers dans nos économies. 
 
Cependant, il faudra poursuivre notre recherche afin de comprendre pleinement les évolutions 
en cours. C’est là, à mon sens, que réside la beauté de notre analyse monétaire. Elle nous 
invite, et même nous contraint, à faire face à la complexité du monde dans lequel nous vivons 
et au caractère constamment évolutif de notre environnement et de notre comportement. C’est 
précisément l’objectif de cette conférence.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours du Gouverneur lors de la conférence annuelle à Tokyo de 
Paris EUROPLACE le 29 novembre 2006 
 
 
 L’EURO CONSTITUE-T-IL UNE REUSSITE ? 
 
 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de me trouver ici aujourd’hui et de pouvoir m’adresser à un 
public d’une telle qualité pour évoquer devant lui la grande réussite que constitue l’euro. 
Comme vous le savez, l’intégration européenne a traversé une période difficile. Le Traité 
instituant une Constitution pour l’Europe n’a pu être ratifié l’année dernière et de nombreuses 
incertitudes pèsent sur l’avenir de l’intégration politique européenne. En outre, les pays 
européens doivent encore accomplir de nombreux efforts en matière de réformes structurelles 
s’ils veulent parvenir au même niveau de croissance potentielle que les autres économies 
développées. 
 
Je reste, cependant, très optimiste. Et la raison de cet optimisme, c’est l’euro. La monnaie 
unique présente d’énormes avantages pour les nations européennes, leur permettant 
d’atteindre un degré élevé de stabilité et de prospérité.  
 
1) Quels sont ces avantages ? 
 
Le premier, et le plus évident, est la stabilité des prix. Au cours des cinq dernières années, 
l’inflation est demeurée globalement conforme à l’objectif de stabilité des prix fixé par la 
 
 2
Banque centrale européenne, à savoir une hausse des prix inférieure à 2 %, mais proche de ce 
niveau, à moyen terme. L’époque où les citoyens européens devaient s’inquiéter du pouvoir 
d’achat de leur épargne est révolue. La notion de stabilité dépasse les simples évolutions 
observées. Les anticipations d’inflation ont été elles-mêmes remarquablement stables, y 
compris durant la période récente de renchérissement des cours du pétrole. Cet exemple 
illustre, en soi, la crédibilité qu’a acquise l’Eurosystème, après seulement sept années 
d’existence. 
 
Deuxièmement, les entreprises et les ménages européens récoltent les fruits de cette 
crédibilité. Les taux d’intérêt à long terme se situent à un niveau historiquement bas, 
inférieurs de près de 100 points de base à ceux constatés aux États-Unis. Par conséquent, 
même après les récentes hausses des taux à court terme, les conditions monétaires et 
financières demeurent extrêmement favorables pour l’investissement et la croissance 
économique. Et de fait, l’Europe pourrait amorcer une période de croissance durablement 
soutenue, du moins si les projections et les résultats d’enquête dont nous disposons 
actuellement se vérifient dans les mois à venir. 
 
Le troisième avantage de l’euro, c’est qu’il favorise l’intégration financière en Europe. Sur de 
nombreux compartiments, les marchés européens de capitaux ont atteint la profondeur et la 
liquidité qui, jusqu’à présent, étaient l’apanage des marchés en dollars. Cette évolution 
favorise l’investissement productif, les restructurations (comme en témoigne la vague actuelle 
d’opérations de fusions-acquisitions) et, d’une manière plus générale, une allocation plus 
efficiente de l’épargne et un meilleur partage des risques. 
 
 
 3
L’euro est ainsi devenu extrêmement attractif en tant que monnaie véhiculaire, de transaction, 
de placement et de réserve. Comme vous le savez, en tant que banquiers centraux, nous 
conservons une attitude de neutralité s’agissant de l’internationalisation de l’euro. Nous 
n’encourageons, ni ne décourageons le processus. Mais en tant que citoyen, je ne puis 
m’empêcher d’être fier de disposer de l’une des deux principales devises du monde. 
 
Au total, le degré de crédibilité élevé de la politique monétaire, qui se reflète dans le niveau 
des taux d’intérêt à long terme, la diminution de la volatilité du taux de change, l’achèvement 
du marché unique et le développement des échanges transfrontières sont au nombre des 
avantages apportés par l’euro.  
 
Bien sûr, rien de tout cela ne peut être considéré comme acquis. Les conditions favorables qui 
prévalent actuellement sur les marchés financiers peuvent s’inverser. Des chocs externes ou 
internes pourraient se produire, avec une incidence négative sur les économies européennes. 
L’économie américaine pourrait par exemple connaître un ralentissement plus marqué 
qu’anticipé. Sous l’effet de la croissance excessive du crédit, des déséquilibres d’ordre 
interne, quoiqu’aucunement comparables à ceux observés dans d’autres économies 
développées, pourraient apparaître dans la zone euro, notamment dans le secteur immobilier. 
Mais j’ai la ferme conviction que nous sommes parfaitement armés pour faire face à toute 
crise éventuelle et, à condition que les nécessaires réformes structurelles soient mises en 
œuvre, pour maintenir l’économie sur la voie de la croissance et de la stabilité. 
 
2) Comment ces succès ont-ils été obtenus ? 
 
 
 4
De mon point de vue, principalement grâce au cadre institutionnel et opérationnel dans lequel 
la politique monétaire est élaborée et mise en œuvre.  
 
L’indépendance de la BCE et des douze, très bientôt treize, BCN participantes est inscrite 
dans le Traité. Elles sont institutionnellement, opérationnellement et financièrement 
indépendantes des institutions de la Communauté européenne et des gouvernements 
nationaux. 
 
Notre définition de la stabilité des prix, annoncée publiquement, est claire et transparente : 
une inflation inférieure à 2 %, mais proche de ce niveau, à moyen terme. 
 
Le cadre de la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème a une orientation à « moyen terme ». Il 
s’appuie sur une approche fondée sur deux piliers : d’une part, l’analyse économique examine 
les indicateurs conjoncturels, économiques et financiers ayant trait aux principaux 
déterminants de l’inflation à court terme ; d’autre part, l’analyse monétaire, qui suit le 
comportement des agrégats de monnaie et de crédit, appréhende l’inflation dans une 
perspective à plus long terme. Le recoupement des résultats de l’analyse économique 
(généralisation de la croissance dans la zone euro) avec ceux de l’analyse monétaire (liquidité 
abondante et croissance monétaire soutenue) contribue à l’évaluation des risques à moyen et 
long termes qui a déterminé les décisions du Conseil des gouverneurs depuis décembre 2005. 
 
La mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire est décentralisée. Les décisions prises par le 
Conseil des gouverneurs sont mises en œuvre par les BCN. 
 
 
 5
Ce cadre a fait la preuve de sa robustesse et de son efficacité. Toutefois, la politique 
monétaire ne peut résoudre à elle seule tous les problèmes. Sa principale contribution à la 
croissance consiste à maintenir la stabilité des prix. Mais au bout du compte, pour que cette 
stabilité se traduise par une croissance plus élevée à long terme, elle doit s’accompagner de 
réformes visant à accroître le potentiel de l’économie. À cet égard, les pays européens font 
des progrès, bien qu’à un rythme trop lent.  
 
3) Comment les États membres de l’UE peuvent-ils accroître leur potentiel de 
croissance ? 
 
En 2000, le Conseil européen de Lisbonne a élaboré une nouvelle stratégie visant à 
promouvoir la compétitivité de l’UE et a défini des objectifs ambitieux à cet égard. L’agenda 
de Lisbonne a introduit une surveillance multilatérale des politiques structurelles. En 2005, les 
chefs d’État et de gouvernement ont relancé la stratégie de Lisbonne en la recentrant sur la 
croissance et l’emploi ainsi que sur un « cadre de gouvernance rationalisé ». Les éléments 
essentiels de cette stratégie sont constitués par les programmes nationaux de réforme, qui 
couvrent, pour chaque pays, les engagements pris sur un cycle de trois ans en matière de 
réformes structurelles. 
 
L’UEM, au sein de laquelle coexistent une politique monétaire unique et des politiques 
budgétaires relevant de douze et bientôt treize gouvernements, nécessite un cadre 
institutionnel dans le domaine des finances publiques. Il doit être simple, facile à mettre en 
œuvre et capable de garantir des politiques budgétaires saines et soutenables, afin d’éviter les 
comportements de cavalier seul et des effets néo-ricardiens. 
 
 
 6
Le processus de surveillance le plus largement débattu, parce que le plus contraignant, est le 
Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance (PSC). Le Pacte peut être défini comme le « mode 
d’emploi » s’appliquant à l’obligation, définie dans le Traité et imposée aux États-membres, 
de parvenir à une situation budgétaire à moyen terme proche de l’équilibre ou en excédent, le 
ratio de déficit public par rapport au PIB ne devant pas dépasser 3 % et le ratio de la dette 
publique 60 % du PIB. Les États membres qui ne respectent pas ces ratios sont soumis à une 
procédure concernant les déficits excessifs qui peut amener le Conseil Ecofin à prendre une 
série de mesures pouvant aller de simples recommandations à des sanctions financières. 
 
En 2005, le Conseil européen a décidé de réformer le Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance. 
L’importance du rôle du PSC en termes de discipline budgétaire a été confirmée. La réforme 
définit les critères de mise en œuvre de la procédure concernant les déficits excessifs et 
accroît la marge de manœuvre en matière de délai de correction des déficits excessifs. 
Toutefois, elle ne réduit pas le caractère contraignant du Pacte, ni son efficacité. 
 
Pour conclure, je mentionnerai l’ampleur des progrès accomplis en Europe au cours des 
cinquante dernières années. L’UE est parvenue à un niveau d’intégration parfois encore 
inégal, mais, d’une manière générale, très ambitieux : diversité qui tient au fait que le degré 
d’intégration dépend dans une large mesure des domaines concernés, caractère ambitieux 
parce que, dans certains domaines précisément, le système est complètement intégré et repose 
sur une politique unique. À cet égard, l’euro est à la fois le symbole de nos réalisations et 
notre plus grand espoir pour l’avenir de l’intégration européenne. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence de printemps 
 
(Banque de France / Deutsche Bundesbank) 
 
Eltville 
 
 
 2 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
- C’est un privilège et un grand plaisir pour moi d’ouvrir cette conférence, la première à être 
organisée conjointement par la Banque de France et la Deutsche Bundesbank. J’espère, 
tout comme le président Weber, qu’elle ouvrira la voie à de nombreux autres évènements 
de ce type, soit en France soit en Allemagne. 
 
- Cette conférence porte sur un sujet qui, à mon sens, revêt une importance cruciale. En 
effet, les banques centrales collectent et analysent un volume considérable de données 
individuelles, essentiellement sur les banques et les entreprises. Ces informations sont 
utilisées de façon large pour évaluer la situation économique et les perspectives 
d’évolution à court terme de la production, de la demande et des prix. Elles servent 
également à alimenter les modèles macroéconomiques de prévision et d’évaluation des 
politiques économiques ; enfin, elles contribuent à identifier les éventuelles menaces pour 
la stabilité du système financier. À une époque où l’innovation financière connaît un 
développement rapide, la recherche analytique fondée sur les données individuelles est 
particulièrement utile pour aider les banquiers centraux à relever les défis du maintien de la 
stabilité des prix et de la stabilité financière. 
 
L’innovation financière, définie comme l’apparition de nouveaux instruments et services 
financiers ainsi que l’émergence de nouvelles formes d’organisation sur des marchés plus 
sophistiqués et plus complets, a de nombreux effets positifs bien connus :  
 
 • en rendant les marchés plus complets, elle améliore l’allocation des ressources, 
soutenant ainsi les perspectives de croissance à plus long terme1 ; 
 
 
 3 
 • l’innovation financière semble même réduire la volatilité de la croissance, comme cela a 
été démontré pour les États-Unis2 et confirmé pour un échantillon de 25 pays3. 
S’agissant des entreprises, ce constat semble résulter d’une plus grande flexibilité de la 
structure financière. Dans le cas des ménages, il résulterait de l’assouplissement des 
contraintes de crédit en termes de garanties exigées4, permettant aux ménages de mieux 
lisser leur consommation face à une modification temporaire de leur revenu5. En outre, 
la déréglementation et l’innovation sur les marchés de financement du logement 
permettent aux ménages de faire l’acquisition de logements dont la valeur est 
compatible avec leurs perspectives de revenu à long terme, comme cela a été démontré, 
par exemple, dans le cas des États-Unis, à l’aide des données issues de l’enquête Panel 
Study of Income Dynamics. 
 
L’innovation financière ne suit pas un profil d’évolution régulier, certaines périodes étant plus 
actives que d’autres, notamment les périodes de libéralisation financière et d’utilisation accrue 
des technologies de l’information dans les activités à caractère financier. C’est ce que l’on a 
clairement observé au cours des dernières années avec le développement rapide des dérivés de 
crédit, de la titrisation, des hedge funds et du private banking, qui a abouti à une situation 
dans laquelle la plus grande part du risque de crédit ne se présente plus sous la forme de prêts 
détenus jusqu’à l’échéance au bilan des banques, mais a été transféré vers des institutions 
financières non bancaires qui peuvent recourir à un fort effet de levier. Cette évolution s’est 
produite en Europe dans un contexte d’innovation financière majeure, à savoir l’introduction 
de l’euro, et elle crée de nouveaux défis pour les banquiers centraux en rendant l’analyse

monétaire plus complexe, en modifiant le mécanisme de transmission de la politique 
monétaire et en risquant, dans certains cas, de menacer la stabilité financière.      
1.  L’innovation financière constitue un défi pour l’interprétation de l’évolution des 
agrégats monétaires et la meilleure utilisation de notre second pilier 
Il n’est quère surprenant, dans un contexte de constante innovation financière, d’observer des 
signes d’instabilité de la demande de monnaie. L’apparition de nouveaux produits et de 
nouveaux intermédiaires tend à estomper la distinction entre actifs monétaires et non 
monétaires et à modifier le comportement financier des agents économiques. De fait, la 
demande de monnaie dans la zone euro montre de nets signes d’instabilité depuis 2001, 
parallèlement à une rupture dans la vitesse-revenu de M3. Il est très intéressant de constater 
que, au lieu de présenter un profil erratique, la vitesse semble suivre une nouvelle tendance, 
caractérisée par une croissance beaucoup plus rapide de la liquidité6. Il est juste de dire que le 
rôle précis de l'innovation financière à cet égard n’est pas encore connu, mais nous avons 
toutes les raisons de penser que sa prise en compte devrait permettre d'expliquer cette 
évolution de la demande de monnaie et de mieux évaluer ses conséquences pour les tensions 
inflationnistes futures. Laissez-moi préciser ma pensée.  
 
En premier lieu, l’introduction de l’euro, qui est en soi une innovation financière majeure, a 
eu de nombreux effets sur le comportement des agents économiques. 
 
Elle a immédiatement entraîné : 
• la suppression de tout risque de change entre les pays participants ; 
• l’introduction d’un nouveau système de réserves obligatoires rémunérées ; 
                                                     
6 Noyer, 2006b 
 
 5 
 • et la création d’un marché monétaire intégré, grâce notamment à la mise en place 
d’un nouveau système de paiement de gros montant (Target). 
 
En outre, grâce à l’introduction de l’euro et au succès de la politique monétaire conduite par la 
BCE, tous les pays bénéficient désormais d’un contexte d’ancrage solide des anticipations 
d’inflation et, donc, d’un bas niveau des taux d’intérêt. 
 
Ce nouvel environnement comporte plusieurs conséquences : 
  
 tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur de la zone euro, la réputation de l’euro en tant que 
monnaie solide a favorisé une augmentation de la détention de billets en euros qui a plus 
que doublé en quelques années, représentant actuellement la plus forte circulation de 
billets dans le monde ; 
 
 le « biais national » qui affecte la composition des portefeuilles d'actifs s’est encore 
atténué, tant à l’intérieur de la zone euro pour ce qui est des actifs émis dans les autres 
États membres, que dans le reste du monde s’agissant des actifs émis dans la zone euro. 
Ces évolutions ont globalement accru la demande d’actifs financiers libellés en euros ;  
 
 l’intégration et la concurrence sur les marchés bancaire et financier, favorisées par 
l’euro, ont accéléré le développement et la diffusion de l’innovation financière dans 
l’ensemble de la zone euro, affectant les évolutions de la monnaie et du crédit de 
différentes façons. Je souhaiterais en évoquer quelques-unes. 
 
  
 
 
 6 
 • Tout d’abord, le rythme d’expansion rapide des activités de ce que l’on appelle les 
« autres institutions financières » (ou AIF). Les AIF ne font pas partie du secteur créateur 
de monnaie et ne sont ni des compagnies d’assurance ni des fonds de pension. Elles 
incluent, notamment, des véhicules ad hoc qui achètent, regroupent et restructurent sous 
forme de titres négociables des prêts « titrisés » par les banques, limitant ainsi la croissance 
des crédits au secteur privé. L’expansion des activités des AIF se traduit, dans une certaine 
mesure, dans les évolutions de leurs actifs monétaires qui sont à présent relativement 
significatifs et représentent environ 10,5 % de M3. Je pense qu’il est peu probable que, 
dans des circonstances normales, les encaisses monétaires des AIF soient transférées vers 
les agents non financiers et génèrent une demande additionnelle de biens et de services. La 
lecture des évolutions de M3 et leur interprétation en termes de risques pour la stabilité des 
prix devrait, très vraisemblablement, être adaptées en conséquence.  
 • L’innovation financière a également exercé une incidence sur les évolutions de la 
monnaie et du crédit en facilitant la couverture du risque de crédit et la gestion du non-
adossement des échéances et des signatures par les banques. Cela a pu favoriser l’offre de 
crédit ces dernières années, notamment de prêts à long terme aux ménages. De fait, les 
prêts au logement ont progressé de 9,8 % par an dans la zone euro depuis début 1999. 
 • Ces dernières années, deux innovations susceptibles d’avoir une incidence sur 
l’élasticité aux taux d’intérêt de la demande de monnaie sont apparues. L’une prend la 
forme de dépôts à rendement élevé et très liquides accessibles par le biais de la banque 
directe ou de comptes gérés sur internet. La seconde, qui est encore marginale, est 
constituée par l’introduction de ce que l’on appelle les « produits structurés destinés à la 
clientèle des particuliers » qui sont généralement des dépôts à court terme auxquels sont 
associés des produits dérivés adaptés aux besoins des investisseurs. 
 
 
 7 
Prendre en compte les effets de l’innovation financière constitue un réel défi pour l’analyse 
monétaire, et pour relever ce défi, il est nécessaire de disposer d’outils mis à jour 
régulièrement et d’études approfondies fondées, notamment, sur l’analyse sectorielle.  
 
* 
*       * 
2. En affectant le mécanisme de transmission, l’innovation financière 
représente également un défi pour la conduite de la politique monétaire 
Pour les banques centrales, il est essentiel d’avoir une bonne connaissance des mécanismes 
par lesquels la politique monétaire influence l’économie. L’innovation financière exerce une 
incidence sur ces mécanismes en transformant les canaux par lesquels la politique monétaire 
opère et en modifiant l’incidence globale des décisions de politique monétaire. Mais 
l’ampleur de ces changements et l’effet précis exercé par l’innovation financière sont mal 
connus, dans un contexte où d’autres facteurs, tels que la mondialisation, sont également à 
l’œuvre. À l’heure actuelle, les études montrent que l’innovation financière a tendance à 
renforcer les canaux des taux d’intérêt et du taux de change, tandis qu’elle semble affaiblir 
celui du crédit. 
 
 • L’innovation financière contribue certainement à accroître les effets de richesse et 
donc, probablement, à renforcer le canal des taux d’intérêt7. Ce phénomène peut 
s’expliquer de la façon suivante : 
 
 • L’innovation financière favorise une diffusion plus rapide de l’information, qui est ainsi 
plus vite intégrée dans les prix sur le marché financier. Bien entendu, cela est 
                                                     
7 BRI, 1994 
 
 8 
particulièrement vrai pour les décisions de politique monétaire et peut par conséquent 
accroître l’efficacité de la politique monétaire, notamment par le biais du canal des taux 
d’intérêt8. 
 
 • L’innovation financière contribue à un accroissement de la détention d’actifs financiers 
en réduisant les coûts de transaction et en facilitant les stratégies d’arbitrage, de 
couverture, de financement et d’investissement.  
 
 • L’innovation financière repose souvent sur des effets de levier plus importants, qui 
accentuent l’incidence de la modification des taux d’intérêt par la banque centrale. Le 
comportement des hedge funds, qui empruntent généralement des fonds à court terme 
pour financer leurs investissements (à plus long terme), en constitue un exemple9. 
 
- En ce qui concerne le canal du taux de change, l’innovation financière a pour résultat une 
plus grande intégration des marchés financiers domestiques et internationaux qui pourrait 
également renforcer ce canal, les taux de change devenant plus sensibles aux différentiels 
de taux d’intérêt entre les zones monétaires. Cette situation a été illustrée par le débat 
récent concernant les opérations de carry trade transfrontière10.  
 
- Dans le même temps, l’innovation financière a probablement affaibli le canal du crédit11. 
Plusieurs phénomènes peuvent jouer un rôle à cet égard : 
 
                                                     
8 Noyer, 2001 
9 Weber, 2007 
10 Weber, 2007 
11 BRI, 1994 ; Thornton, 1994 
 
 9 
 • L’innovation financière offre aux entreprises un accès plus large aux marchés des 
valeurs mobilières, ce qui peut réduire les asymétries d’information à la source du canal 
du crédit. 
 
 • Plus précisément, les opérations de titrisation effectuées par les banques ont réduit leurs 
contraintes de liquidité et ont donc encore affaibli le canal du crédit. Une étude publiée 
récemment par la Réserve fédérale de New York, qui utilise un ensemble de données 
microéconomiques relatives aux prêts individuels accordés par un échantillon de 
banques entre 1997 et 2005, montre que l’utilisation des dérivés de crédit est associée à 
une offre plus importante de prêts nouvellement négociés octroyés à des sociétés 
emprunteuses de taille importante. Les études précédentes avaient généralement montré 
que les banques avaient utilisé les innovations antérieures sur le marché du crédit, telles 
que les cessions de prêts ou la titrisation, pour diversifier leur exposition au risque et 
accroître leurs prêts. 
 
 • Toutefois, les dérivés de crédit pourraient également inciter les banques à surveiller les 
risques moins attentivement que par le passé et donc atténuer les effets mentionnés 
précédemment qui affaiblissent le canal du crédit. Dans la mesure où les banques 
surveillent leurs risques de manière efficace, cette incidence devrait toutefois n’être que 
partielle. 
 
Les études menées au sein du réseau de l’Eurosystème sur le mécanisme de transmission ont 
déjà montré que le canal des taux d’intérêt est un maillon essentiel de la transmission de la 
politique monétaire dans la zone euro12. L’innovation financière ayant tendance à renforcer ce 
canal, il serait tentant d’affirmer qu’elle rend la politique monétaire plus efficace. Toutefois, il 
est difficile de tirer une conclusion générale en raison des effets inverses qui s’exercent. En 
 
 10 
outre, on ne dispose pas d’études empiriques sur cette question. J’encourage donc fortement 
les chercheurs à apporter de nouveaux éléments aux responsables de la politique monétaire, 
en s’appuyant en particulier sur des données microéconomiques. 
 
* 
*       * 
3. L’innovation financière peut, dans certains cas, compromettre la stabilité financière 
et les banques centrales ont à prendre les mesures appropriées afin de limiter les 
risques systémiques potentiels 
Ces questions peuvent se poser au niveau tant microéconomique que macroéconomique. 
 
 - Examinons d’abord le niveau microéconomique.  
 
 • Des difficultés peuvent se faire jour lors de l’apparition de nouveaux produits : 
difficultés de valorisation, manque de liquidité du marché, expertise éventuellement 
insuffisante de certains opérateurs, et ainsi de suite. Cependant, ces problèmes doivent 
être considérés comme de nature essentiellement transitoire. En effet, l’innovation 
financière a amélioré et accru l’efficacité du système financier. En particulier, les 
risques sont répartis sur un plus grand nombre d’agents, qui sont disposés à les 
supporter et en ont a priori la capacité. Toutefois, les innovations introduisent sans 
cesse de nouvelles couches de sophistication et de complexité13. À cet égard, le 
système d’incitations qui guide l’activité des gestionnaires d’actifs professionnels 
devrait être aligné étroitement et en permanence sur les intérêts des investisseurs. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                      
12 Angeloni, Kashyap et Mojon, 2003 
 
 11 
 • Une forme particulière de l’innovation financière est l’apparition de nouveaux acteurs 
non soumis à réglementation dont la défaillance pourrait avoir des implications pour le 
risque systémique. Les hedge funds sont un exemple de ce type d’investisseur. Les 
activités des hedge funds pourraient manifestement être une source de risque systémique 
dans la mesure où ces fonds sont désormais des acteurs importants, et souvent 
dominants, de plusieurs compartiments de marché, représentant 40 % du chiffre 
d’affaires des principales bourses mondiales et 25 % du chiffre d’affaires des marchés 
de dérivés de crédit. Ces fonds sont également les principaux fournisseurs de liquidité 
sur certains marchés, liquidité qui s’assécherait très vite s’ils s’en retiraient. Ils 
s’endettent souvent eux-mêmes avec de forts multiplicateurs, soit directement par 
emprunt, soit indirectement par utilisation intensive de produits dérivés. 
 
  •  L’importance des hedge funds, et plus généralement des AIF déjà mentionnés, montre 
que dans certaines circonstances, l’injection de liquidité dans le système bancaire, outil 
traditionnel de gestion de crise utilisé par les banques centrales, peut ne pas suffire à 
prévenir une instabilité majeure. Trois grandes pistes visant à limiter les risques de 
contagion des défaillances de hedge funds, que ce soit par des pertes potentielles pour 
leurs créanciers bancaires ou par une dynamique de marché défavorable, ont été 
proposées14. Premièrement, une intervention appropriée des autorités de surveillance 
auprès des prime brokers est essentielle afin de s’assurer qu’ils demandent et obtiennent 
suffisamment d’informations de la part des hedge funds et qu'ils mettent en place une 
gestion complète du risque de toutes leurs expositions liées à ces fonds. Deuxièmement, 
il serait possible pour les autorités de favoriser une organisation appropriée de 
l’infrastructure permettant d’améliorer la disponibilité de l’information relative aux 
marchés sur lesquels interviennent les hedge funds. Troisièmement, un système 
                                                                                                                                                                      
13 Noyer, 2006a 
14 Noyer, 2007 
 
 12 
d’information spécifique, activable en cas de crise, pourrait être instauré ex ante afin de 
garantir que l’information pertinente concernant les expositions et les encours puisse 
être collectée rapidement le cas échéant. 
 
 - Au niveau macroéconomique 
 
 • L’augmentation de la détention d’actifs financiers résultant de l’innovation financière 
pourrait se traduire par une plus grande sensibilité des ménages aux fortes variations des 
prix des actifs15. Du côté du passif du bilan des agents non financiers, en facilitant la 
gestion du risque et en assouplissant les contraintes de liquidité, l’innovation financière 
stimule à la fois l’offre et la demande de crédit, ce qui pourrait entraîner un endettement 
et une fragilité financière accrus. Notons que ces deux effets vont à l’encontre du 
résultat que j’ai cité au début, à savoir le fait que l’innovation financière tend à réduire 
la volatilité de la croissance. Bien que ce résultat puisse encore être avéré dans des 
circonstances normales, il peut ainsi être invalidé dans des circonstances spécifiques, en 
particulier en situation de crise. 
 
 • Enfin, les liens entres les marchés étant resserrés par l’innovation financière, un choc se 
produisant sur un marché particulier serait plus facilement transmis, et peut-être 
amplifié, sur d’autres marchés. Cela peut être le cas en particulier si le choc est 
important et si les opérateurs de marché adoptent un comportement moutonnier en 
réponse à la diffusion très rapide d’un flux d’informations.

Je ne tenterai pas d’apporter de conclusion à ces remarques préliminaires, puisque l’objectif 
de cette conférence est précisément d’approfondir toutes les questions que j’ai mentionnées 
brièvement et peut-être d’autres que j’ai omises. Et c’est finalement au Président Axel Weber 
qu’il incombera de tirer les conclusions. Mais permettez-moi de faire juste une dernière 
observation. L’innovation financière apporte de nombreux progrès et l’on doit s’en féliciter 
sur le principe. Elle constitue également un défi permanent pour les responsables de banque 
centrale. Une bonne connaissance du comportement microéconomique est essentielle afin de 
mieux faire face à la montée des incertitudes et aux nouveaux types de risques qui les 
accompagnent. Il s’agit là d’un défi auquel je suis sûr que cette conférence s’efforcera de 
répondre.

Discours prononcé par Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France, devant les agents 
de la Banque de réserve d’Inde, le 14 mai  
Les défis posés par la libéralisation financière aux économies de marché émergentes  
 
Je suis très heureux et très honoré d’être ici et je tiens à remercier chaleureusement mon ami M. Reddy 
de m’avoir invité à intervenir devant les agents de la Banque de réserve d’Inde. 
La Banque des règlements internationaux a récemment annoncé que le Vice-gouverneur de la Banque 
de Réserve d’Inde, M. Rakesh Mohan, allait présider un nouveau groupe de travail sur « Les flux de 
capitaux et les économies émergentes ». Je souhaite le féliciter pour avoir accepté d’étudier cette 
question complexe et je vais vous présenter quelques réflexions sur un thème qui y est lié : « Les défis 
posés par la libéralisation financière aux économies de marché émergentes ». 
 
La libéralisation financière s’entend comme la suppression des contrôles internes et externes sur les 
flux de capitaux. Elle présente de nombreux aspects positifs :  
- elle contribue, notamment, à améliorer l’efficience globale en matière d’allocation du capital, 
au niveau tant national qu’international. 
- elle favorise la concurrence sur les marchés de capitaux et permet ainsi de réduire le coût du 
capital et d’améliorer la gestion des risques ; 
- elle accroît également le rôle de la discipline de marché tant pour les dirigeants d’entreprise 
que pour les responsables de la politique économique car elle accroît les coûts liés aux lacunes 
en matière de gouvernance.  
 
Même s’il existe un consensus au sujet de ces effets positifs, l’expérience a montré que l’ouverture 
financière modifie l’équilibre des risques au niveau macroéconomique :  
- premièrement, elle peut réduire certains risques, par exemple en atténuant la corrélation entre 
investissement et épargne ;  
- deuxièmement, elle peut néanmoins accroître d’autres risques : par exemple, une concurrence 
accrue au sein du système bancaire peut provoquer une forte croissance du crédit liée à un 
assouplissement des conditions d’octroi des prêts, les banques nationales cherchant à 
maintenir leurs profits et leurs parts de marché ;  
- troisièmement, elle peut même conduire à l’apparition de nouveaux risques, par exemple par 
le biais de la contagion financière, si l’appétence pour le risque vis-à-vis des marchés 
émergents s’inverse brusquement, compte tenu du rôle essentiel des hedge funds dans les 
investissements transfrontières et des modifications brutales de la répartition de leurs actifs. À 
cet égard, la Banque de France a publié récemment un numéro spécial de sa Revue de la 
 
 2
stabilité financière consacré aux hedge funds qui peut présenter un intérêt pour la Banque de 
Réserve d’Inde (www.banque-france.fr).  
 
À la différence de l’expérience française qui s’est déroulée dans les années quatre-vingt, le processus 
indien de libéralisation financière intervient dans un contexte de mondialisation à tout va et 
d’innovation accélérée. Ce processus est progressif, mais  caractérisé par le succès, et ce n’est pas une 
surprise si l’Inde a été l’un des premiers pays à participer volontairement au Programme d’évaluation 
de la stabilité financière du FMI. À mon avis, le caractère progressif et transparent de ce processus est 
essentiel pour garantir qu’un pays recueille l’ensemble des bénéfices de son intégration dans 
l’économie mondiale. 
 
Les leçons qui peuvent être tirées d’une comparaison avec l’expérience française peuvent sembler 
limitées dans la mesure où, dans les années quatre-vingt, la France enregistrait des sorties de capitaux, 
alors que les économies émergentes se trouvent à présent souvent confrontées à des entrées de 
capitaux à caractère spéculatif. Je pense toutefois que même si le défi est devenu plus difficile à 
relever, la réussite du processus de libéralisation financière pour les économies de marché émergentes 
repose toujours sur les deux conditions essentielles qui s’appliquaient à la France : 
- instaurer un système financier national résilient lors de, ou avant, l’ouverture du compte 
financier ; 
- mettre en place des institutions et des politiques économiques appropriées. 
 
Je vais développer ces deux points dans la suite de mon intervention. 
 
1. Une libéralisation réussie exige un renforcement du système financier national lors de, ou 
quelquefois avant, l’ouverture du compte financier 
 
Je vais vous rappeler brièvement pourquoi et comment cela peut être réalisé.  
Tout d’abord, pourquoi? Parce qu’un secteur financier efficient garantit à la fois un meilleur 
financement et une meilleure protection de l’économie. 
 
D’une part, il garantit un meilleur financement de l’économie en élargissant la base des investisseurs 
et en améliorant leur capacité à utiliser des instruments financiers diversifiés. La concurrence au sein 
du secteur financier contribue non seulement à limiter le coût du capital mais favorise également 
l’innovation, permettant ainsi une gestion plus efficace des risques. Par exemple, la titrisation offre 
aux institutions financières des instruments permettant de gérer la structure de leur bilan et contribue 
ainsi à soutenir la distribution du crédit tout en favorisant le développement des marchés financiers. En 
outre, le développement des marchés obligataires permet de financer plus facilement les déficits 
 
 3
publics, tout en proposant des instruments permettant aux investisseurs internationaux de diversifier 
leur portefeuille. Il fournit une référence pour le marché et peut ainsi ouvrir la voie à l’émission 
d’obligations privées. 
 
D’autre part, un secteur financier efficient et développé protège mieux l’économie des risques d’une 
crise du compte financier. La plupart des crises qui ont frappé les économies de marché émergentes 
dans les années quatre-vingt-dix avaient été déclenchées ou accompagnées par des crises bancaires. 
Afin d’améliorer la résistance aux chocs externes, il est indispensable que les acteurs financiers 
puissent gérer les risques de taux d’intérêt et de taux de change dans un environnement plus flexible, 
tant pour eux-mêmes que pour leurs clients.   
 
Comment parvenir à ce résultat sans encombre ? 
Il existe une sorte de paradoxe dans l’interaction entre libéralisation interne et libéralisation externe : 
la première peut constituer une condition préalable à la seconde, mais l’ouverture externe peut 
contribuer à favoriser et à renforcer les réformes financières internes. De fait, en l’absence de défi créé 
par la concurrence étrangère, les réformes financières internes risquent de n’être ni assez vastes, ni 
assez rapides.  
 
En outre, s’agissant de la diffusion des meilleures pratiques, la présence d’étrangers dans le capital des 
banques nationales peut garantir une adoption plus rapide des normes et des codes internationaux, 
notamment en ce qui concerne la surveillance, le contrôle et la gestion des risques financiers et 
opérationnels. Cet élément est essentiel pour la résistance et la stabilité du système financier. Le 
rapport du Groupe de travail du Comité sur le système financier mondial (Committee on the Global 
Financial System – CGFS) sur les « Investissements directs étrangers dans le secteur financier des 
économies de marché émergentes » a souligné que l’un des avantages durables de ces IDE était leur 
incidence sur l’efficience du secteur financier, grâce aux transferts de technologie et aux innovations 
qui leur sont généralement associés s’agissant des produits et des processus. Outre leur faible 
volatilité, cet élément constitue une raison supplémentaire pour laquelle il semble préférable d’attirer 
des flux de capitaux à long terme, tels que les IDE, plutôt que des flux à court terme, même si les 
leçons de l’expérience chilienne par rapport à certaines mésaventures dans les pays asiatiques 
indiquent qu’il n’existe pas un modèle unique s’appliquant à tous. Mais j’ai constaté que le volume 
des IDE en Inde, qui était jusqu’alors relativement faible, est en train d’augmenter de façon 
significative (16 milliards de dollars en 2006-2007), ce qui constitue un signe indubitable de son 
attractivité. En France aussi, nous accordons une grande attention aux entrées de capitaux enregistrées 
au titre des IDE (plus de 60 milliards en 2006), car ils sont également importants dans une économie 
plus mature.  
 
 
 4
Ainsi, lorsqu’elles déterminent le calendrier de la libéralisation interne par rapport à la libéralisation 
externe, les autorités doivent trouver le juste équilibre et le bon rythme entre ces deux éléments. À cet 
égard, permettez-moi d’évoquer brièvement la façon dont nous avons géré ce processus en France 
dans les années quatre-vingt. La libéralisation financière a débuté sur le plan intérieur par :  
- la modernisation du marché monétaire ; 
- l’approfondissement des marchés obligataires, en utilisant la courbe des rendements des titres 
du secteur public comme benchmark (afin de déterminer le prix des actifs risqués) ;  
- l’élargissement de la base des marchés boursiers (y compris les privatisations) ; 
- enfin et surtout, la création de nouveaux compartiments du marché financier (contrats à terme, 
options...). 
 
Parallèlement, mais parfois avec un certain décalage, le compte financier de la France a été libéralisé. 
Nous sommes passés d’une situation, en 1983, dans laquelle le contrôle des changes était à son niveau 
le plus strict, à la suite de diverses attaques spéculatives et de trois dévaluations en dix-huit mois, à 
une suppression progressive de ces contrôles débutant en 1984 et achevée en 1990. Les transactions 
liées aux échanges commerciaux ont été progressivement libéralisées, suivies par la plupart des 
transactions financières puis, enfin, les résidents ont été autorisés à ouvrir librement des comptes en 
devises et les banques françaises à prêter des francs français aux non-résidents.  
 
Bien entendu, l’expérience indienne est différente de celle de la France car il n’existe pas de processus 
de transition unique. Et j’aimerais beaucoup connaître votre point de vue sur ce sujet. 
 
2. Toutefois, laissez-moi d’abord vous rappeler que pour réussir, il ne suffit pas d’améliorer le 
système financier : la mise en place d’institutions et de politiques économiques appropriées est 
essentielle  
 
La nécessité de mettre en place des institutions solides ne devrait jamais être sous-estimée. Un 
document du G20 intitulé Institution building in the financial sector (le renforcement des institutions 
dans le secteur financier), auquel l’Inde et la France ont participé, a souligné l’importance de la 
robustesse des institutions ainsi que de l’existence de marchés financiers profonds et sophistiqués, 
éléments essentiels pour maximiser les avantages de la mondialisation et réduire les risques de crises 
financières. Un cadre institutionnel approprié comprend, entre autres, un système juridique 
fonctionnant de façon satisfaisante, un système de paiement fiable, un cadre adéquat de réglementation 
et de supervision, un système approprié de garantie des dépôts, et des conditions propices à la mise en 
application des nouvelles évolutions des technologies de l’information et de la communication. 
 
 
 5
En tant que dirigeant d’une banque centrale, je soulignerai bien entendu l’importance du rôle de cette 
institution. Elle doit être le gardien de la santé de « l’écosystème financier », au moyen d’une 
surveillance renforcée et d’une amélioration permanente du cadre réglementaire et juridique. 
L’efficacité de la surveillance doit être favorisée par un organisme indépendant, qui peut avoir des 
liens plus ou moins étroits avec la banque centrale. En France comme en Inde, la surveillance bancaire 
incombe, en fait, aux experts de la banque centrale. Un dispositif de surveillance solide et un cadre 
juridique transparent sont susceptibles d’encourager les participations étrangères et d’optimiser les 
avantages qui y sont associés en termes de meilleures pratiques.  
 
La nécessité d’une surveillance appropriée n’est en effet pas réduite, mais modifiée, ou peut même être 
accrue en cas de libéralisation financière. Par exemple, selon un groupe de travail placé sous l’égide de 
la Banque des règlements internationaux, auquel participent actuellement la Banque de Réserve de 
l’Inde et la Banque de France, le développement des marchés obligataires locaux transforme les types 
de risques qui pèsent au plan intérieur, le risque de change étant remplacé par le risque de taux 
d’intérêt ou de transformation. Il est donc nécessaire de renforcer la gestion des risques et d’en 
contrôler la pertinence dans le secteur bancaire et dans les institutions dans lesquelles le risque peut 
avoir été transféré. En effet, les innovations financières telles que les instruments de transferts du 
risque de crédit peuvent répartir les risques, mais elles ne les font pas disparaître. 
 
La banque centrale est également responsable de la production et de la diffusion de différentes séries 
de statistiques monétaires et financières dont la qualité est de la plus haute importance pour les 
responsables et les investisseurs. Un appareil statistique efficace fournit la base de la transparence 
financière, contribuant ainsi à la diffusion des meilleures pratiques en termes de gouvernance. Par 
ailleurs, la qualité des institutions influe fortement sur la composition des mouvements de capitaux à 
destination des économies émergentes. Il s’agit d’un déterminant essentiel des flux d’IDE, qui tendent 
à accroître les avantages de l’intégration financière.  
 
La nécessité de mettre en œuvre des politiques et des stratégies économiques saines ne doit pas non 
plus être négligée.  
 
Dans un monde globalisé, au sein duquel les pays se livrent concurrence pour attirer les capitaux 
étrangers, la poursuite de politiques budgétaires et monétaires saines exerce une incidence non 
seulement sur le montant mais aussi sur la composition des entrées de capitaux. De telles politiques 
renforcent la résilience de l’économie aux chocs externes et permettent donc à la croissance de 
bénéficier au maximum des avantages de la libéralisation du compte financier.  
 
 
 6
Les crises récentes nous rappellent combien les déséquilibres macroéconomiques peuvent être 
exacerbés par la fragilité financière et provoquer des crises du compte financier affectant la croissance 
économique. Ainsi, l’expérience montre que des déficits budgétaires excessifs sont plus dangereux 
dans un contexte de marchés de capitaux ouverts. En fait, la discipline de marché ne joue pas toujours, 
ou n’est pas toujours suffisante, face à une appétence excessive pour le risque et à un manque de 
discrimination. Par conséquent, des règles internes et des engagements des pouvoirs publics peuvent 
s’avérer nécessaires, à l’instar du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance européen. 
 
De même, la libéralisation financière doit s’accompagner de politiques structurelles visant à renforcer 
l’efficacité des marchés du travail et des biens. Ces politiques sont effectivement nécessaires pour 
améliorer la capacité de l’économie réelle d’attirer et de répartir le capital ainsi que de réduire les 
vulnérabilités et d’absorber les chocs potentiels. Là encore, il existe un lien entre le rythme approprié 
de la libéralisation des marchés financiers et l’interaction entre cette libéralisation et celle de la sphère 
réelle. Une fois enclenché, le processus de libéralisation financière bénéficie de l’innovation 
permanente et de sa propre dynamique. Il n’en va pas de même pour les réformes du marché du travail 
et des produits qui se heurtent à des rigidités et à des obstacles souvent profondément enracinés. 
 
Enfin, une meilleure intégration dans l’économie mondiale nécessite une stratégie appropriée en 
matière de taux de change. Une économie émergente qui enregistre d’importants gains de productivité 
et une croissance potentielle élevée dans le secteur exposé risque d’enregistrer d’importantes entrées 
de capitaux et de connaître une appréciation de son taux de change réel sur le long terme. Cette 
évolution peut résulter soit d’une appréciation du taux de change nominal, soit d’une hausse des prix 
relatifs, soit des deux à la fois. 
 
L’appréciation du taux de change, qui peut entraîner une surévaluation de la monnaie, constitue sans 
doute un risque pour les économies émergentes qui suivent des stratégies de croissance tirées par les 
exportations. Afin de limiter l’appréciation et de maintenir leur compétitivité, certaines de ces 
économies, comme la Chine, ont accumulé des montants toujours plus élevés de réserves de change. 
Toutefois, la sous-évaluation des monnaies représente également un risque significatif, non seulement 
en matière d’inflation mais aussi parce qu’elle permet aux non-résidents d’acquérir à bon marché des 
actifs nationaux. En outre, la sous-évaluation contribue à gonfler les déséquilibres mondiaux. En 
passant, je suis heureux de remarquer que l’Inde comme la zone euro sont dotées de réserves 
importantes mais non excessives et qu’aucune des deux n’est responsable de la persistance des 
déséquilibres mondiaux. 
 
Un recours accru à la flexibilité des taux de change dans les pays émergents qui ont enregistré une 
accumulation excessive de réserves de change pourrait donc constituer un facteur de résorption des 
 
 7
déséquilibres mondiaux. De plus, cela pourrait contribuer à faciliter la gestion de la politique 
monétaire intérieure (en allégeant les tensions inflationnistes) et permettre une meilleure maîtrise de la 
croissance de la liquidité et des risques associés à l’accumulation des réserves et à leur stérilisation. 
 
Bien entendu, la mise en place progressive de la flexibilité des taux de change implique de lever les 
contrôles des mouvements de capitaux à un rythme approprié. L’Asie de l’Est a connu ce processus et 
je suis désireux de connaître vos points de vue sur l’interaction entre réformes financières, institutions 
et politiques structurelles ou macro-économiques. 
 
*   *   * 
 
Pour conclure, je dirai que dans le processus de libéralisation dans lequel la France, et par la suite 
l’Inde, se sont engagées, les deux pays peuvent tirer des enseignements de l’expérience de l’autre, car 
ils présentent des caractéristiques similaires et sont des acteurs clé d’un monde globalisé.  
 
À cette fin, il convient de renforcer la coopération.  
 
La coopération entre la Banque de Réserve de l’Inde et la Banque de France est particulièrement 
importante en raison des similarités que présentent ces institutions, en termes de diversité des activités, 
de structures (y compris les succursales) ou en ce qui concerne le recrutement à vie, par concours, de 
leurs agents.  
 
Au niveau du secteur financier, un renforcement de la « fertilisation croisée » serait également 
appréciable. Le secteur financier français comprend certaines des plus grandes banques et sociétés 
d’assurance européennes. Leur comportement économique est efficace et repose sur un vaste marché 
intérieur et les meilleures pratiques internationales. Cela leur permet de générer une forte rentabilité et 
de se développer à l’étranger.  
 
Néanmoins, avant tout, le secteur financier français présente des caractéristiques spécifiques qui 
peuvent être utiles aux opérateurs indiens. En particulier, je souhaiterais mentionner :  
- les liens historiques avec le secteur public, comme en Inde, où les banques publiques continuent de 
dominer le secteur bancaire ; 
- l’expertise du secteur bancaire dans un environnement rural, contexte particulièrement pertinent pour 
l’Inde, et comportant de grands groupes industriels, les groupes industriels indiens jouant 
effectivement un rôle important au plan international.

À cet égard, je me félicite de participer avec la Banque de Réserve de l’Inde au lancement du premier 
forum financier franco-indien le 16 mai à Mumbai. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de M. le Gouverneur au « Salzburg Seminar » 
(1er Octobre 2007) 
Les implications systémiques de l’accumulation des réserves de change 
 
Les réserves de change constituent un sujet qui n’est pas nouveau, mais il a acquis une 
nouvelle importance pour deux raisons évidentes : le niveau de ces réserves s’est fortement 
accru au cours de la dernière décennie ; et la gestion de ces réserves est de plus en plus 
diversifiée. Aujourd’hui, je souhaiterais réfléchir aux implications de ces changements pour le 
système monétaire et financier international. Je m’attacherai à étudier leur lien avec la 
persistance des déséquilibres mondiaux, leurs conséquences sur l’allocation globale du capital 
et les prix des actifs, ainsi que leur influence sur les structures et la gouvernance économique 
dans tous les pays, tant émergents que développés. 
 
Le niveau et la nature des avoirs de réserve internationaux 
 
Les faits 
Les réserves de change mondiales se sont considérablement accrues, passant de 
2 000 milliards de dollars en 2001 au niveau sans précédent de 5 000 milliards début 2007. La 
part des pays émergents d’Asie dans ce total est passée de 600 milliards de dollars à plus de 
2 000 milliards, leurs réserves ayant augmenté à un rythme de 200 à 300 milliards de dollars 
 2
par an depuis 2003. En outre, les avoirs de réserve des pays exportateurs de pétrole ont 
fortement progressé en 2005 et 2006, de plus de 200 milliards de dollars chaque année. 
 
Les facteurs déterminants 
Pour bien comprendre la nature de cette accumulation prolongée des réserves de change, il est 
important d’examiner les différents facteurs à l’origine de ce processus. 
Une assurance contre les chocs 
Les facteurs à l’origine de l’accumulation d’avoirs de réserve internationaux dans les pays 
émergents étaient à l’origine purement liés à des motifs d’assurance contre les crises, dans le 
contexte de l’ancrage de nombreuses devises au dollar. Dans le sillage des crises financières 
de la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix, alors que leurs réserves officielles s’étaient rapidement 
amenuisées, les pays émergents ont rapidement reconstitué leurs avoirs de réserve pour se 
prémunir contre de nouvelles attaques spéculatives et renforcer leur capacité à absorber les 
chocs induits par des interruptions brutales des entrées de capitaux. Il est compréhensible que 
ces pays aient souhaité se protéger contre les conséquences macroéconomiques désastreuses 
de crises semblables à celle qu’ils venaient de traverser. Cette auto-assurance visait également 
à limiter à l’avenir la nécessité de recourir à un renflouement par la communauté 
internationale. Même pour les pays n’ayant pas directement souffert de la crise, ces 
motivations ont probablement joué un rôle éminent, dans la mesure où un certain degré de 
libéralisation du compte de capital était peut-être envisagé dès ce moment. Toutefois, avec le 
temps, la persistance d’importants excédents courants a entraîné une accumulation sans 
précédent de réserves officielles. 
Un moyen de dissuasion contre les attaques spéculatives 
Une approche qui a également été envisagée par la littérature académique consiste à 
reconnaître que la probabilité d’une attaque spéculative peut être substantiellement réduite par 
une politique d’accumulation de réserves. De fait, l’incidence très limitée des récentes 
turbulences financières sur les devises des pays émergents pourrait, dans une certaine mesure, 
montrer le bien-fondé de la constitution de réserves à titre de précaution.  
Les avoirs de réserve comme outil de la croissance  
 3
Dans une série d’articles, Dooley, Garber et Folkerts-Landau1 ont indiqué que ce qu’ils 
qualifient de « nouveau Bretton Woods » pourrait fournir une explication cohérente des 
tendances en matière de déséquilibres des comptes courants et d’accumulation des réserves. 
Selon eux, les économies émergentes d’Asie suivraient des stratégies de croissance tirée par 
les exportations en maintenant délibérément une sous-évaluation de leur taux de change, tout 
en finançant le déficit courant américain, les États-Unis étant un de leurs principaux 
débouchés. Ils supposent également que d’importantes réserves de change peuvent avoir été 
accumulées « en garantie » des investissements directs étrangers. Cette interprétation met en 
lumière la responsabilité partagée des profils de consommation aux États-Unis et de la 
dynamique de croissance en Asie émergente dans la formation des déséquilibres mondiaux 
des transactions courantes.  
 
Les réserves de change sont-elles « excédentaires » ? 
Les normes de référence 
L’évaluation du niveau approprié de réserves accumulées par un pays nécessite la prise en 
compte des motivations initiales de détention de ces réserves, pour élaborer une norme 
quantitative.  
S’appuyant sur l’expérience des crises de change, les directives du FMI pour la gestion des 
avoirs extérieurs de réserve stipulent que « les réserves de changes sont détenues pour 
satisfaire plusieurs objectifs », notamment : 
•  « susciter et maintenir la confiance » dans la politique monétaire et de change, y compris la 
capacité à effectuer des interventions sur le marché des changes ; 
•  « limiter la vulnérabilité externe en maintenant des réserves liquides de change afin 
d’absorber les chocs en temps de crise ou lorsque l’accès au crédit est restreint et, ce faisant : 
•  « donner aux marchés l’assurance que le pays est en mesure de remplir ses obligations 
extérieures ».

working paper ; (2007) – The Two Crises of international Economics, NBER working paper.

Il y a encore peu de temps, le niveau requis d’avoirs de réserve était estimé empiriquement 
par exemple selon la « règle des trois mois d’importations ». Suite à l’expérience des années 
quatre-vingt-dix, lorsque les crises financières avaient été déclenchées par un tarissement des 
entrées de capitaux, la capacité des économies ayant recours à l’endettement extérieur à 
assurer le service de leur dette est devenue un critère primordial. La règle 
« Greenspan-Guidotti » recommande par conséquent que les réserves puissent couvrir 
entièrement la dette extérieure à court terme afin d’être en mesure de rembourser celle-ci dans 
l’éventualité d’interruptions soudaines des entrées de capitaux, c'est-à-dire au cas où les 
prêteurs étrangers ne renouvelleraient pas leurs prêts.  
La littérature empirique montre qu’aujourd’hui le niveau des réserves de change dans certains 
pays émergents apparaît excessif au vu de ces deux règles.  
Jeanne et Rancière2 ont récemment défini un « cadre normatif quantitatif » visant à déterminer 
le niveau optimal de réserves de change permettant d’atténuer l’incidence d’une interruption 
brutales des entrées de capitaux. Leur modèle, qui repose sur des critères de bien-être 
économique, montre que l’accumulation de ces réserves a été excessive dans certains pays 
d’Asie depuis 1997-1998. Il est certain que la crise asiatique a probablement incité les 
économies émergentes à réévaluer le risque de telles éventuelles interruptions brutales et 
l’ampleur des récessions qui peuvent en résulter. Quand règne un degré élevé d’incertitude, 
l’exercice d’appréciation d’un niveau optimal de réserves de change nous confronte au 
problème de la prise en compte d’événements catastrophiques. En d’autres termes, même si la 
probabilité d’une crise financière est très faible, ses conséquences éventuelles peuvent être si 
dramatiques que les pays émergents pourraient être fondés à accumuler des réserves très 
importantes. Néanmoins, l’approche standard utilisée par Jeanne et Rancière suggère que le 
niveau des réserves de certains pays est excessif si l’on s’en tient au motif d’auto-assurance 
contre les crises.  
Conséquences au plan intérieur pour la politique monétaire 
L’accumulation excessive de réserves de change peut entraîner des déséquilibres financiers 
internes. Ces derniers peuvent résulter d’une stérilisation incomplète ou inefficace3. Bien que 
théoriquement réalisables par l’émission de titres de la banque centrale, les stérilisations de

Countries : Formulas and Applications, document de travail du FMI

domestic implications?, Rapport trimestriel de la BRI.

grande envergure s’avèrent, en pratique, problématiques, tout particulièrement dans les 
économies émergentes qui ne disposent pas toujours de suffisamment d’instruments de 
marché pour leur mise en oeuvre. Pour contrôler efficacement une expansion exubérante du 
crédit, ces économies ont souvent eu recours à un relèvement important du taux des réserves 
obligatoires ou même à des instruments réglementaires, comme le rationnement du crédit. 
Quand le crédit et les taux d’intérêt sont largement administrés, le coût budgétaire de la 
stérilisation peut être efficacement transféré au secteur bancaire, puis finalement répercuté sur 
la clientèle des banques et sur les actionnaires, mais cela ne supprime pas pour autant le coût 
d’opportunité de la stérilisation pour le secteur privé, ni les risques monétaires résultant d’une 
stérilisation incomplète. En réalité, dans les économies où l’accumulation massive de réserves 
de change nécessite leur stérilisation, il est très probable que l’efficacité de l’allocation du 
capital diminuera, en particulier s’il est nécessaire de recourir à des instruments 
réglementaires. 
Réserves de change et concurrence internationale 
Le deuxième risque est celui de voir l’accumulation des réserves exacerber la concurrence 
commerciale et accentuer les tensions régionales. Les économies émergentes sont en 
concurrence pour exporter à destination des économies développées, tout autant qu’elles sont 
en concurrence avec ces dernières. Comme le remarque Aizenman4, « dans un monde où des 
économies émergentes symétriques se font concurrence sur des secteurs d’activité 
comparables, l’accumulation compétitive [de réserves] tend à annuler l’essentiel des gains de 
compétitivité, entraînant l’appauvrissement de ces économies et une « accumulation excessive 
de réserves ». En revanche, dans un monde asymétrique, une économie émergente où le coût 
de la stérilisation serait suffisamment bas pourrait gagner la guerre de l’accumulation des 
réserves, [...], à l’instar de la stratégie d’appauvrissement du voisin (beggar-thy-neighbour 
policy) appliquée dans une guerre commerciale asymétrique ». L’hétérogénéité des économies 
émergentes d’Asie, ainsi que leur interdépendance commerciale, peut nécessiter une 
interprétation plus nuancée. Toutefois, cette interdépendance même accroît les enjeux 
d'éventuelles tensions commerciales.  
Ces tensions au niveau régional et international créent de véritables risques de réactions 
protectionnistes, dont le coût économique et social pourrait être très élevé. Une accumulation

Architecture, document de travail du NBER

prolongée de réserves de change sous une forme ou une autre est donc susceptible de générer 
des externalités négatives, que ce soit au plan intérieur ou au niveau international. 
Plus généralement, l’émergence de détenteurs de réserves de change d’une telle envergure 
contribue à façonner un nouvel « ordre financier mondial », dont la stabilité reste encore à 
démontrer. 
Réserves de change et allocation de l’épargne 
À ce stade, il est utile de se pencher de plus près sur les motifs qui président à l’épargne dans 
les économies asiatiques, c’est-à-dire de rechercher les raisons pour lesquelles les agents 
économiques de ces pays épargnent autant. Outre le rôle potentiellement puissant des facteurs 
démographiques, le motif de précaution apparaît comme une explication évidente : les taux 
d’épargne élevés enregistrés par les économies émergentes sont probablement liés au sous-
développement de leurs systèmes de protection sociale (qu’il s’agisse des dispositifs 
d’assurance-maladie ou de retraite). Au niveau des ménages, l’auto-assurance contre les 
risques idiosyncratiques (par opposition à l’auto-assurance au niveau de la banque centrale) 
peut favoriser l’accumulation d’un patrimoine important à titre de précaution.  
De plus, la constitution d’une épargne de précaution peut être plus importante dans les 
économies émergentes, qui se caractérisent par une plus grande instabilité macroéconomique. 
En outre, lorsque le secteur privé a un accès limité au crédit, les agents doivent recourir à des 
ressources propres, que ce soit pour les achats de biens durables dans le cas des ménages ou 
pour les investissements dans celui des entreprises. 
Quels sont les mécanismes sous-jacents qui font que cette épargne privée se retrouve dans les 
bilans du secteur public ? Cette substitution de l’épargne publique à l’épargne privée dans les 
pays émergents résulte de l’interaction entre deux facteurs fondamentaux : des marchés de 
capitaux incomplets et des régimes de change non flexibles. 
Au-delà des contraintes de crédit, une caractéristique essentielle de ces marchés de capitaux 
incomplets dans les économies émergentes est le manque d’actifs financiers domestiques, tels 
que des titres à revenu fixe. En conséquence, une large part de l’épargne se retrouve sous 
forme de dépôts bancaires. 
L’autre facteur clé est, bien entendu, le régime de change. Dans de nombreuses économies 
émergentes et en Chine en particulier, les excédents commerciaux ont pour contrepartie des 
 7
entrées nettes en devises. Les réglementations relatives au compte de capital imposent parfois 
des restitutions de ces revenus en devises mais, plus fondamentalement, dans un régime de 
change fixe ou d’ancrage du taux de change, la banque centrale rachète les devises cédées 
pour éviter une appréciation de la monnaie locale.  
Le régime s’appliquant au compte de capital et les contraintes financières des économies en 
développement conduisent la banque centrale à « emprunter » auprès du secteur privé en 
contrepartie domestique de l’accumulation de réserves de change. Les banques jouent 
naturellement un rôle central d’intermédiation dans ce mécanisme en collectant des dépôts au 
titre de l’épargne privée et en acquérant des titres destinés à stériliser les entrées de devises. 
Ceci vient compléter le mécanisme par lequel l’épargne privée excédentaire se retrouve sous 
la forme d’excédents de réserves de change détenus par le secteur public.  
Bien entendu, on pourrait juger estimer que les banques centrales jouent leur rôle en reprenant 
les positions de change  du secteur privé : naturellement, la détention d’avoirs en devises 
exposerait les agents privés au risque de change et, à cet égard, on peut considérer que la 
détention de ces avoirs par le secteur public permet aux agents économiques nationaux de se 
soustraire à ce risque. Toutefois, ce raisonnement appelle deux objections : 
- En tant que contribuables, les agents privés domestiques demeurent indirectement 
exposés à la réalisation de l’important risque de change supporté par les gestionnaires 
publics des réserves de change, qui se traduirait par des coûts budgétaires. 
- Si le régime applicable au compte de capital n’avait pas conduit à ce que le secteur 
public gère cette épargne sous forme d’avoirs en devises, les entreprises (et 
éventuellement les ménages) auraient, en principe, directement investi leur épargne en 
instruments financiers de leur choix à l'étranger. De façon plus réaliste, ils auraient 
probablement choisi de dénouer leurs positions de change et de placer leur épargne en 
actifs domestiques. En l’absence d’intervention officielle, le taux de change se serait 
ajusté.  
Toutefois, il n’en demeure pas moins que les réserves de change appartiennent à la nation qui 
a accumulé ces actifs et donc indirectement aux agents privés domestiques (y compris le cas 
échéant aux générations futures). L’intermédiation publique de cette épargne nous conduit 
naturellement à nous demander quel est le style de gestion approprié pour des portefeuilles 
d’une telle ampleur. 
 
 8
La gestion des avoirs de réserve 
Les faits 
D’importants excédents courants se traduisent mécaniquement par un excédent d’épargne 
domestique (publique ou privée), qui doit être investi à l’étranger. Toutefois, en Asie de l’Est 
et dans les pays exportateurs de matières premières, il apparaît que cette épargne excédentaire 
accumulée est détenue pour une grande part par les États. En plus des réserves officielles de 
change, une proportion croissante de ces avoirs est à présent investie sous forme de fonds 
d’investissement souverains (sovereign wealth funds). 
Pour le moment, les actifs gérés par ces fonds (soit 2 500 milliards de dollars environ) sont 
relativement peu importants au regard de la capitalisation totale des marchés d’actions et 
d’obligations (près de 100 000 milliards), ou même par rapport aux actifs détenus par les 
grands gérants institutionnels (fonds de pension, sociétés d’assurance et OPCVM) qui sont 
estimés à 55 000 milliards de dollars. Toutefois, d’après certaines estimations, les actifs des 
fonds d'investissement souverains pourraient plus que tripler au cours des cinq prochaines 
années et atteindre près de 8 500 milliards en 2012.  
Tous les fonds d’investissement souverains partagent un objectif commun qui est de transférer 
de la richesse vers le futur. Les objectifs des banques centrales sont différents, à savoir 
favoriser la stabilité des prix et la stabilité financière. En outre, les banques centrales peuvent 
être plus sensibles au risque d’image et le fait d’être exposé à des pertes importantes pourrait 
nuire à leur crédibilité. Par conséquent, créer une entité distincte de la banque centrale, à 
savoir un fonds d’investissement souverain, pour gérer des actifs risqués a souvent été 
considéré comme une bonne structure de gouvernance. Cette structure est également censée 
dresser une muraille de Chine entre les banques centrales et les fonds d’investissement 
souverains, en éliminant le risque de transactions fondées sur des informations d’initiés. 
L’efficacité d’une telle séparation peut cependant être remise en question mais surtout ces 
structures ne peuvent pas totalement empêcher les conflits d’intérêts. 
Il convient probablement d’établir une distinction entre les fonds d’investissement souverains 
liés aux matières premières et les autres. Dans les pays producteurs de pétrole, l’accumulation 
d’actifs internationaux résulte d’une rente pétrolière se traduisant par d’importants excédents 
des finances publiques, de sorte que leur gestion par des entités publiques en est une 
conséquence naturelle. Le financement des fonds d’investissement souverains de matières 
premières provient d’une ressource domestique le plus souvent détenue, exploitée ou taxée 
 9
par l’État : il s’agit donc bien d’une richesse publique, qui résulte de l’épargne publique. En 
revanche, l’accumulation d’avoirs de réserves de change et par des fonds d’investissement 
souverains non liés aux matières premières pourraient être considérés comme résultant 
principalement de la réorientation d’un excédent d’épargne privée.  
Fonds de matières premières 
L’instauration de fonds de stabilisation par les pays exportateurs de pétrole était motivée 
avant tout par le souhait de lisser des revenus du pétrole très volatils, dans un objectif de 
maximisation de la rente pétrolière globale. Dans la mesure où les matières premières sont des 
ressources non renouvelables, la théorie économique standard recommande qu’une partie des 
revenus tirés de leur extraction soit épargnée afin de lisser la consommation nationale 
intertemporelle, à l’instar d’un particulier qui épargne au cours de sa vie active en vue de sa 
retraite, mais peut-être également pour transmettre un héritage à sa descendance. Les fonds 
d’investissement souverains de matières premières ont en effet été motivés tout autant par une 
tentative d’optimisation des bénéfices intertemporels tirés des ressources naturelles au-delà de 
leur horizon d’épuisement, que par une volonté d’équité vis-à-vis des générations futures. À 
ce titre, les fonds pétroliers sont loin de représenter une nouveauté : les premiers fonds ont 
ainsi été créés à la suite des deux premiers chocs pétroliers. La forte remontée des cours du 
pétrole ces dernières années, qui a permis à de nouveaux gisements de devenir rentables, a 
naturellement conduit les pays concernés à créer de nouveaux fonds. 
Fonds d’investissement non liés aux matières premières  
Les fonds d’investissement qui ne sont pas liés aux matières premières résultent 
principalement des interventions de change et peuvent être considérés comme des 
« excédents » d’avoirs de réserve qui ne peuvent plus être gérés de façon appropriée dans le 
cadre classique appliqué aux avoirs de réserve officiels. L’une des questions qui se posent est 
de savoir s’ils obéissent à la même logique que les fonds de matières premières et dans quelle 
mesure on peut considérer qu’ils reposent sur les mêmes fondations saines. 
 
Commentaires 
Les réserves de change sont généralement placées en avoirs sûrs et liquides tels que les bons 
du Trésor à court terme et à long terme ou les dépôts à court terme assortis d’une garantie. 
 10
L'accent mis sur le contrôle du risque de liquidité dans le cadre de la gestion prudente des 
réserves résulte logiquement de leur possible utilisation pour des interventions sur le marché 
des changes.  
En revanche, les fonds d’investissement souverains sont clairement conçus pour investir en 
actifs moins liquides et plus risqués, fournissant un rendement plus élevé que ceux qui 
figurent habituellement dans les réserves officielles. Alors que l’objectif d’un rendement 
raisonnable était habituellement mentionné en dernier, « compte tenu des contraintes de 
liquidité et des autres risques » dans les directives du FMI pour la gestion des réserves de 
change, il est évident que les fonds d’investissement souverains visent au premier chef à 
générer un surcroît de rendement. Cette inversion des priorités se justifie, bien entendu, par 
l’horizon d’investissement beaucoup plus lointain de ces fonds, ce qui, en retour, implique 
une plus grande acceptation des fluctuations à court terme. De fait, le développement des 
fonds d’investissement souverains est à rapprocher de celui des régimes de retraite publics par 
capitalisation, qui adoptent souvent une approche comparable en matière d’allocation d’actifs. 
Ainsi, en Norvège, le Fonds de pension de l’État (Government Pension Fund – Global), qui a 
succèdé au Petroleum Fund, est géré par rapport à un portefeuille de référence stratégique 
détenant 40% de ses actifs en actions, dont 50 % non européennes.  
Dans le cas de certaines économies d’Asie de l’Est, le transfert de réserves officielles vers un 
fonds d’investissement souverain entraîne une diminution du degré de liquidité des avoirs 
détenus. Néanmoins, dans la mesure où les rendements attendus sont plus élevés, investir dans 
des actifs plus risqués présente notamment l’avantage de réduire le coût budgétaire de la 
stérilisation. 
L’allocation stratégique des actifs des fonds d’investissement souverains pourrait en principe 
être déterminée en fonction des risques spécifiques auxquels est confronté le pays. Les 
économies de marché émergentes se caractérisent par toute une série de vulnérabilités aux 
chocs macroéconomiques tels que les variations brutales des cours du pétrole, des métaux ou 
des matières premières agricoles ainsi que les fluctuations cycliques de l’activité dans les 
économies développées. Par exemple, il semble naturel que l’allocation optimale des actifs 
des pays producteurs de pétrole devrait être diversifiée au profit d’actifs n’ayant pas de 
corrélation avec les cours de cette matière première. En revanche, la plupart des pays 
asiatiques importent des matières premières et pourraient couvrir leurs risques en prenant des 
positions longues sur des contrats à terme ou d'autres actifs étroitement corrélés avec les cours 
 11
des matières premières. Les fonds d’investissement souverains peuvent ainsi potentiellement 
fournir des services de « macro-couverture » à leurs pays. La tâche pourrait toutefois s’avérer 
plus facile pour les exportateurs de matières premières : leurs risques macroéconomiques sont 
faciles à identifier, fortement concentrés et les instruments de couverture peuvent être 
mobilisés facilement sur les marchés financiers. 
 
Problèmes 
Incidence sur les prix d’actifs 
Dans quelles conditions la gestion publique d’actifs peut-elle aller de pair avec un 
fonctionnement ordonné des marchés financiers ? 
On constate que le montant important des réserves de change exerce déjà une incidence sur 
les prix d’actifs. La forte préférence pour la sécurité et la liquidité des réserves officielles, 
conjuguée à l’augmentation rapide des avoirs de réserve, a souvent été évoquée pour 
expliquer ce qu’Alan Greenspan avait à le premier qualifié d’énigme, à savoir la persistance 
d’un bas niveau des taux d’intérêt à long terme. Selon Warnock et Warnock5, par exemple, 
dans l’hypothèse d’une « absence de flux officiels étrangers en direction des emprunts publics 
américains en 2005 », le rendement des bons du Trésor à dix ans aurait été supérieur de 
90 points de base. Plusieurs autres estimations ont été formulées à cet égard. Elles présentent 
des différences importantes, mais toutes concluent à une incidence plus ou moins forte de ces 
flux sur les taux d’intérêt à long terme. 
Dans la mesure où les fonds d’investissement souverains détiennent des portefeuilles dont le 
couple rendement/risque est plus élevé que dans le cas des fonds classiques de gestion des 
réserves de change, de nombreux économistes de marché prévoient que leur évolution se 
traduira par une augmentation de la demande pour les catégories d’actifs à risque, comme les 
actions, et une baisse de la demande pour les actifs à faible risque, comme les titres d’État à 
court terme. Cela pourrait entraîner, en théorie, une hausse des rendements obligataires 
(inversant ainsi en partie l’incidence antérieure de l'accumulation de réserves officielles) ainsi 
qu'une diminution de la prime de risque sur actions. L’estimation de ces effets doit cependant 
être interprétée avec prudence : elle s’appuie sur des hypothèses fragiles, qui posent 
                                                 
5 F. Warnock et V. Warnock (2006) – International Capital Flows and US Interest Rates, document de travail du 
NBER 
 
 12
l’équivalence entre le développement des avoirs risqués des fonds d’investissement 
souverains et l’atténuation durable de l’aversion au risque au niveau mondial. Avant d’arriver 
à cette conclusion, il convient de garder à l’esprit que, si l’épargne privée n’avait pas fait 
l’objet d’une réintermédiation par le biais du secteur public, elle aurait pu tout aussi bien être 
investie directement en actifs risqués.  
Cependant, l’incidence des placements effectués par les fonds d’investissement souverains sur 
certains marchés financiers étroits et non liquides, tels que l’or, les matières premières et 
l’immobilier, pourrait être importante. Dans la mesure où les fonds d’investissement 
souverains tenteront de se prémunir contre les risques macroéconomiques pesant sur leur 
pays, des difficultés pourraient apparaître en raison de la moindre liquidité des meilleurs 
instruments de couverture existants par rapport à la liquidité des actions ou des obligations. 
Le risque d’un effet potentiellement déstabilisateur sur la dynamique des prix d’actifs devrait 
donc être reconnu pour les fonds souverains de grande taille, comme le souligne le rapport du 
FMI sur la stabilité financière dans le monde (2007).  
Critères d’investissement 
Par leur nature même, les critères utilisés pour déterminer l’allocation stratégique des actifs 
dans un portefeuille souverain ne sont pas uniquement liés au souci de créer de la valeur mais 
peuvent également recouvrir d’autres objectifs. Parmi les principaux critères non financiers, 
des préoccupations liées à l’éthique et à l’environnement sont parfois avancées. Par exemple, 
le Fonds de pension de l’État norvégien a défini en 2004 ses « normes d’éthique » qui 
excluent les investissements dans le secteur de l’armement ou les activités polluantes. Des 
objectifs stratégiques ou industriels peuvent également être poursuivis, comme par exemple 
de faciliter l’accès des entreprises nationales aux nouvelles technologies étrangères ou, plus 
généralement, de renforcer les industries nationales. Un tel exemple est fourni par le nouveau 
fonds d’investissement public chinois, qui pourrait semble-t-il utiliser une partie importante 
de ses actifs pour recapitaliser le secteur bancaire du pays.  
En un mot, les États sont également en charge de la politique économique et il leur est 
intrinsèquement difficile de maintenir une déconnection entre leurs choix de politique 
économique et leurs décisions en tant que gestionnaires des actifs publics. On peut donc 
s’attendre à ce que la répartition stratégique de leurs actifs risqués soit utilisée, dans certains 
cas, comme un autre instrument de politique économique. Compte tenu de ces spécificités des 
 13
portefeuilles souverains d’actifs risqués, il est légitime de se demander si leur croissance pose 
de nouveaux défis aux banques centrales et à la communauté internationale.  
Transparence 
Je souhaiterais conclure en abordant la question du degré adéquat de transparence des fonds 
d’investissement souverains. Ces fonds doivent-ils être plus transparents que les autres 
investisseurs institutionnels ? Cette question doit être examinée sous deux angles différents : 
celui de la responsabilité et celui de la stabilité financière. 
En tant qu’institutions publiques, les fonds d’investissement souverains devraient diffuser un 
minimum d’informations en raison de leur responsabilité fiduciaire. Ces dernières années, les 
institutions publiques ont répondu de plus en plus positivement aux arguments en faveur de la 
transparence. En particulier, les avantages d’une responsabilité plus importante et d’une 
meilleure mesure de performance des institutions publiques tendent à l’emporter sur les 
arguments en faveur de la confidentialité. Par exemple, la plupart des banques centrales 
déclarent aujourd’hui leurs réserves de change au FMI selon la norme SDDS et publient un 
rapport annuel détaillé. L’accord sur les avoirs en or des banques centrales constitue, lui aussi, 
un exemple concret dans lequel la transparence ex ante et ex post des banques centrales 
comporte des avantages significatifs qui ont permis d’éviter des perturbations sur les marchés 
et ce, dans l’intérêt patrimonial de ses participants.  
Un niveau analogue de transparence pourrait donc être étendu aux fonds d’investissement 
souverains, dans leur propre intérêt.  
Certains ont déjà adopté ces bonnes pratiques. Le fonds de pension de l’État norvégien est 
largement considéré comme un modèle en la matière : il publie sur son site internet des 
informations détaillées concernant l’allocation de ses actifs, ses résultats trimestriels et sa 
politique d’investissement. De façon plus large, les fonds de pension publics constituent en 
général un exemple utile. En France, par exemple, le Fonds de réserve pour les retraites 
s’efforce également de garantir transparence et responsabilité. 
Du point de vue de la stabilité des marchés financiers, un manque d’informations concernant 
les avoirs et les stratégies des fonds d’investissement souverains peut favoriser les 
comportements moutonniers, lesquels pourraient avoir une influence très négative sur la 
dynamique des marchés. Compte tenu de cette préoccupation majeure, il serait utile de définir 
un code de conduite, qui pourrait être élaboré dans le cadre d’instances internationales (sous 
 14
l’égide de la Banque mondiale ou du FMI, par exemple), afin de mettre en place des 
exigences minimales concernant le degré adéquat de diffusion d’informations. De nouveaux 
progrès dans ce domaine atténueraient considérablement les préoccupations concernant les 
risques de mauvaise allocation du capital ainsi que les externalités négatives que la gestion 
d’importants actifs internationaux est susceptible de faire naître dans la sphère 
macroéconomique et sur les marchés financiers.

Discours de Monsieur Christian NOYER,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France,  
devant la Banque d’Algérie et la Communauté financière algérienne,  
le 16 décembre 2007 
 
BÂLE 2 : NOUVEAUX DÉFIS 
 
Je suis très heureux et très honoré d’être ici et je tiens à remercier chaleureusement 
mon ami Mohamed LAKSACI de m’avoir invité à intervenir sur le thème de Bâle 2. Ce 
thème est doublement d’actualité : d’abord, en raison de la phase de mise en œuvre 
opérationnelle de ce dispositif dans laquelle nous sommes désormais entrés (ou, suivant 
les pays,  allons entrer) et qui nécessite une mobilisation plus forte que jamais des banques 
et des superviseurs ; ensuite, parce que les turbulences financières actuelles invitent à 
s’interroger sur les modalités optimales de cette mise en œuvre. Je vais donc, à la lumière 
de cette double actualité, vous présenter quelques réflexions sur le thème « Bâle 2 : 
nouveaux défis » en m’efforçant de privilégier les aspects pratiques de la mise en œuvre 
des nouvelles normes. 
À cet égard, et avant de rentrer dans le vif de mon intervention, je tiens à remercier la 
Banque d’Algérie pour sa participation dans le Groupe des superviseurs bancaires 
francophones, dont la création a été décidée lors de la réunion des Gouverneurs des 
Banques centrales des pays francophones de juin 2004 à Paris, c'est-à-dire au moment 
même où le Comité de Bâle sur le Contrôle bancaire a publié le nouvel Accord Bâle 2. Je 
sais que ce groupe est apprécié de nombre de ses membres car il vise à développer 
l’échange d’expériences et d’informations entre ses membres ainsi que la généralisation 
des meilleures pratiques de supervision bancaire vis-à-vis de problèmes communs. Il a 
déjà travaillé, de façon utile, en liaison notamment avec l’Institut de stabilité financière (FSI) 
de la BRI, sur les fondements théoriques comme sur l’application concrète de Bâle 2. 
 2
Aujourd’hui, je souhaiterais tout d’abord évoquer les défis pratiques liés à une mise 
en œuvre effective de Bâle 2, puis insister sur la nécessité de poursuivre l’effort de 
mise en œuvre de ce nouveau dispositif face aux turbulences actuelles, et enfin essayer de 
tirer les premières leçons de ces turbulences financières pour s’assurer que cette mise 
en œuvre soit optimale. 
 
1. La mise en œuvre effective de Bâle 2 est exigeante et requiert de la part des 
établissements de crédit et des superviseurs des efforts importants et des 
moyens conséquents. 
Le premier défi lié à Bâle 2 est en effet d’ordre pratique : il s’agit de passer avec 
succès de la phase d’élaboration de cette réforme du ratio de solvabilité à celle de sa mise 
en œuvre. Ce défi est d’autant plus grand que Bâle 2 constitue un dispositif prudentiel 
beaucoup plus ambitieux que Bâle 1, reposant sur trois piliers complémentaires, avec : 
– des exigences minimales de fonds propres (pilier 1), qui peuvent être calculées selon 
diverses approches, allant d’approches standardisées à des approches internes 
développées par chaque établissement de crédit de façon spécifique. L’approche 
choisie par chaque établissement doit se faire, sous le contrôle du superviseur, en 
fonction de sa taille et de son niveau de sophistication ; 
– un processus de surveillance prudentielle (pilier 2), qui confère au jugement des 
superviseurs un rôle clé dans l’évaluation du profil de risque et de la qualité de la 
gestion de ces risques par chaque établissement ainsi que, in fine, du seuil minimum 
de fonds propres correspondants ; 
– une discipline de marché (pilier 3), qui exige des banques une communication 
financière plus complète. 
 
Ces trois piliers, dont je ne détaillerai pas aujourd’hui les nombreux aspects 
techniques, constituent un ensemble visant principalement : i) à améliorer la gestion 
des risques au sein des banques, ii) à mieux faire correspondre les fonds propres 
réglementaires aux risques réellement encourus par ces dernières, iii) à renforcer le rôle 
des superviseurs, mais aussi iv) celui de la discipline de marché et donc, au final, v) à 
renforcer la stabilité financière. 
 3
La mise en œuvre d’un tel dispositif, comprenant un large spectre d’approches 
possibles pour les banques et couvrant un éventail de risques important, n’est pas 
aisée et explique à cet égard la relative variété des situations nationales actuelles, y 
compris au sein du G10 : le Japon a par exemple mis en œuvre Bâle 2 dès 2007, les pays 
de l’Union européenne le mettront en pratique en 2008 et les États-Unis en 2009. 
L’ampleur de la tâche est d’autant plus grande que Bâle 2, compte tenu de la nature même 
des objectifs poursuivis et que je viens de rappeler, a vocation à être appliqué dans un 
nombre très important de pays. La dernière enquête de l’Institut de Stabilité financière (FSI) 
sur l’application de Bâle 2, publiée en septembre 2006 et réalisée auprès de 115 pays, 
indique que 82 pays non membres du Comité de Bâle comptent mettre en œuvre le 
nouveau dispositif, dans la plupart des cas à partir de 2008 ou 2009, mais parfois au-delà. 
Conscient des enjeux pratiques liés à la mise en œuvre de normes prudentielles 
plus modernes, complètes et sensibles au risque, le Comité de Bâle a publié, en 
juillet 2004, c'est-à-dire dans la foulée du nouvel Accord, un document sur le thème 
« Bâle 2 : considérations pratiques ». Reconnaissant que l’adoption et la mise en 
application de Bâle 2 peut ne pas constituer la priorité de  court terme d’un certain nombre 
d’autorités de contrôle dans des pays n’appartenant pas au G10, le Comité y encourage 
ces dernières à développer leurs propres démarches et leurs propres calendriers de mise 
en œuvre. L’analyse des changements législatifs et réglementaires nécessaires ou encore 
l’identification des besoins en ressources humaines constituent autant de facteurs 
permettant d’expliquer pourquoi le rythme d’application de Bâle 2 dans le monde ne peut 
être que progressif, d’autant plus que des décisions techniques doivent souvent être prises 
sur le choix exact du champ d’application de l’Accord ou sur la possibilité d’une mise en 
œuvre par étape des trois piliers.  
À cet égard, je me réjouis du choix fait par l’Algérie d’adopter et de mettre en œuvre 
prochainement Bâle 2. Ce choix ne doit pas être perçu par les banques comme une 
contrainte réglementaire mais au contraire comme une formidable opportunité de 
converger vers les meilleures pratiques internationales. De surcroît, ce choix est de 
nature à préserver et renforcer la stabilité du système bancaire algérien, obtenue 
notamment par une bonne performance économique et financière depuis 2001 ainsi que 
par un renforcement des capacités de supervision. Ce renforcement en cours depuis 
plusieurs années constitue aujourd’hui un actif important pour la Banque d’Algérie et doit 
permettre, non seulement d’assurer avec succès une conformité de la réglementation et de 
la supervision bancaires algériennes aux normes internationales, tels les principes 
 4
fondamentaux pour un contrôle bancaire efficace édictés par le Comité de Bâle, mais aussi 
de préparer efficacement la mise en œuvre de Bâle 2 avec une bonne appropriation du 
nouveau dispositif par les banques algériennes. 
En tant que Gouverneur de la Banque de France et Président de la Commission 
bancaire, je sais en effet combien la préparation de mise en œuvre de Bâle 2 exige 
d’efforts et de moyens de la part à la fois des établissements et des superviseurs. Laissez-
moi illustrer mon propos en vous présentant brièvement l’action menée par la 
Commission bancaire et son Secrétariat général en vue de la mise en application 
effective de Bâle 2 en France. D’ici au 31 décembre de cette année, plus d’une trentaine 
de missions d’inspection sur place auront été conduites dans près de 20 établissements, 
mobilisant à certains moments jusqu’à 100 agents à la fois. Ces missions sur place ont 
porté sur l’examen des systèmes de notation interne du risque de crédit ainsi que sur les 
approches de mesure avancée du risque opérationnel.  
Ce choix d’une vérification sur place des systèmes et approches internes de 
mesure des risques ainsi que l’importance accordée par la Commission bancaire à 
ces vérifications s’explique notamment par le fait qu’en 2008 17 établissements 
(représentant près de 95 % du total des actifs du système bancaire français) devraient 
utiliser une approche notation interne pour la mesure de leur risque de crédit et 5 
établissements (représentant près de 60 % du total des actifs du système bancaire 
français) devraient utiliser une approche de mesure avancée de leur risque opérationnel. 
La possibilité offerte aux établissements sous Bâle 2 d’utiliser leurs approches internes de 
mesure des risques aux fins du calcul des exigences réglementaires a pour corollaire 
prudentiel la nécessité pour les superviseurs de s’assurer de la fiabilité de ces approches. 
À l’issue de ces missions sur place et de l’examen par la Commission bancaire des 
rapports d’inspection correspondants, 26 programmes d’actions correctrices (« MOU ») 
ont été finalisés en liaison avec les établissements concernés. Ces demandes 
d’améliorations portent notamment sur i) les différentes classes de risque retenues par les 
établissements, parfois aussi ii) sur la définition du défaut utilisée par ces derniers, iii) sur 
l’estimation de certains paramètres comme celui de la sévérité des pertes en cas de défaut 
(Loss Given Default ou LGD dans le langage bâlois), iv) sur l’insertion opérationnelle réelle 
des approches mises en place dans la gestion quotidienne des risques ou encore v) sur les 
principes de gouvernance applicables à ces approches. 
 5
Les dernières actions pour la Commission bancaire d’ici à la fin de l’année 
portent donc sur le suivi de la mise en œuvre des mesures correctrices demandées 
aux établissements. À l’issue de ce processus, la Commission bancaire prendra 
formellement la décision d’autoriser ou non les établissements concernés à adopter les 
approches avancées de Bâle 2 au 1er janvier 2008. Pour les établissements ayant des 
implantations à l’étranger, cette autorisation est donnée, le cas échéant, suite à un échange 
d’informations avec les superviseurs des pays d’accueil - c'est-à-dire ceux où ces 
établissements ont des filiales. 
Alors que nombre de pays, à l’instar de la France, sont entrés dans une phase de 
mise en œuvre effective de Bâle 2, les turbulences financières ont de nouveau attiré 
l’attention sur ce dispositif, conduisant même certains à en remettre en cause son 
économie globale. Ces turbulences ont en effet des caractéristiques nouvelles car il 
s’agit d’une crise de crédit dans un environnement de marché avec des implications 
particulières en ce qui concerne les canaux de contagion. Les opérations de transfert 
de risque, de titrisation notamment, et l’interaction entre risque de refinancement 
(funding liquidity) et de liquidité de marché (market liquidity) ont joué des rôles 
nouveaux ou en tout cas bien plus importants qu’auparavant. Je suis cependant convaincu 
que la réforme du ratio de solvabilité demeure concrètement un élément essentiel de la 
réponse réglementaire aux problèmes auxquels nous sommes confrontés aujourd’hui. Je 
souhaiterais vous exposer maintenant les raisons de cette intime conviction. 
 
2. Les turbulences financières actuelles confirment en effet la nécessité d’une mise 
en œuvre concrète de Bâle 2. 
Bien entendu ces turbulences peuvent légitimement conduire certains à 
s’interroger sur plusieurs dispositions importantes de Bâle 2, comme par exemple le 
recours aux agences de notations ou encore aux approches internes développées par les 
banques pour la mesure du risque de crédit. Le risque associé à un ratio de fonds propres 
réglementaire plus sensible au risque, donc potentiellement pro-cyclique, a également été 
de nouveau parfois avancé. Cependant, je donnerai, quant à moi, au moins cinq 
raisons principales montrant que ces interrogations ne remettent pas en cause les 
avantages procurés par la mise en œuvre de Bâle 2. 
 6
Premièrement, contrairement au ratio actuel de solvabilité, Bâle 2 prévoit, au 
titre du pilier 1, un calcul spécifique des fonds propres réglementaires à mettre en 
face des opérations de transfert de risque de crédit (comme les titrisations et des 
dérivés de crédit). Ceci est indispensable dans le cadre du modèle originate and distribute 
qui est aujourd’hui utilisé par de nombreux établissements financiers et qui consiste à 
transférer le plus rapidement possible les risques associés aux crédits octroyés et non, 
comme dans le passé, à les conserver. Le traitement posé dans Bâle 2 vise ainsi à 
s’assurer que les opérations de titrisation auront désormais une réalité économique propre 
plutôt que de rechercher un arbitrage réglementaire comme parfois en Bâle 1. Fondé sur 
deux principes fondamentaux — d’une part, le caractère effectif du transfert de risque, 
d’autre part, le caractère significatif de ce transfert — le traitement de la titrisation dans 
Bâle 2 s’applique par ailleurs non seulement aux banques agissant comme cédants ou 
investisseurs mais également comme sponsors. Ce traitement tient aussi compte des 
nombreux mécanismes spécifiques existants dans ce type d’opération, tels les clauses de 
terminaison anticipée ou encore les rehaussements de crédit. Enfin, il instaure une 
exigence de fonds propres réglementaires adaptée pour certains engagements de hors 
bilan, en particulier les lignes de liquidité associées à ces opérations, qui étaient en règle 
générale exonérées sous Bâle 1 de toute charge en capital. 
Deuxièmement, Bâle 2, en renforçant le lien existant entre fonds propres et 
risques réellement encourus, incite les banques à améliorer leur système de gestion 
de ces risques ainsi que leurs procédures de due diligence. Au-delà du rappel de 
l’élémentaire prudence nécessaire à l’octroi de crédit, cette incitation est d’autant plus utile 
que les banques jouent désormais souvent un rôle dans des opérations de titrisation pour 
lesquelles les actifs sous-jacents, par exemple des crédits immobiliers, peuvent être initiés 
par des entités non régulées, n’ayant pas toujours à répondre de leur analyse et de leur 
tarification du risque. En d’autres termes, plus la discipline dans l’octroi d’un crédit est 
faible, plus la diligence des établissements doit être forte. 
Troisièmement, Bâle 2 donne aux banques et aux superviseurs  un outil 
essentiel, le pilier 2, pour évaluer le profil de risque des établissements et 
notamment pour prendre en compte certains risques parfois difficilement 
quantifiables mais dont l’impact peut être fort. Je ne citerai comme exemple que le 
risque de refinancement ou encore le risque de réputation. Le pilier 2 permet ainsi tant aux 
banques, au travers de la détermination du niveau de capital économique, qu’aux 
 7
superviseurs, au moyen par exemple d’une majoration des exigences de fonds propres, 
d’assurer une couverture adéquate de l’ensemble des risques encourus. 
Quatrièmement, Bâle 2 s’attache à promouvoir les stress tests comme l’un des 
outils de gestion et de mesure des risques, ce qui est très important pour faire face à des 
turbulences comme celle que nous vivons actuellement. Bâle 2 prévoit en effet que les 
stress tests conduits par les établissements doivent intégrer les effets d’une forte 
augmentation des risques de crédit et de marché ainsi que ceux d’un accroissement du  
risque de liquidité. L’objectif est de  s’assurer que les banques disposent de fonds propres 
suffisants pour absorber  des chocs sévères. 
Cinquièmement, et enfin, Bâle 2 vise à renforcer de manière substantielle la 
transparence et ainsi la discipline de marché. Le pilier 3 du dispositif pose en effet de 
nombreuses exigences en matière de publication d’informations qualitatives et quantitatives 
sur les fonds propres et les risques, y compris s’agissant des  opérations de transfert de 
risque.  L’importance de telles informations a bien été mise en lumière par les turbulences 
financières de l’été, au cours desquelles une transparence plus grande, en particulier 
s’agissant de la nature et de la qualité des actifs logés par les établissements dans les 
conduits de titrisation, s’est avérée nécessaire. 
Pour résumer, et avant d’essayer de tirer les premières leçons de ces turbulences 
pour une mise en œuvre optimale de Bâle 2, j’insisterais donc sur le fait que le nouveau 
dispositif incite les banques à mieux mesurer et gérer les risques liés aux opérations 
de titrisation et à améliorer leur communication financière, deux domaines essentiels 
dans lesquels les problèmes actuels ont mis en évidence que des progrès significatifs 
devaient être réalisés. 
 
3. Les turbulences financières révèlent cependant qu’une mise en œuvre optimale 
de Bâle 2 exige que des progrès soient encore faits dans plusieurs domaines. 
S’il est encore prématuré de tirer des leçons définitives de la période actuelle, il 
apparaît néanmoins que des progrès doivent être faits par les établissements de 
crédit, par exemple dans la gestion du risque de crédit, des risques de marché, du risque 
de liquidité, des risques induits pas certaines activités comme la gestion d’actifs, ou encore 
des risques liés aux méthodes de valorisation de certains instruments financiers. 
 
 8
S’agissant du risque de crédit tout d’abord : 
– Il apparaît important de vérifier que les systèmes de notation interne des 
établissements, ainsi que l’estimation des différents paramètres de risque 
utilisés par ces derniers, feront bien l’objet d’une actualisation reflétant 
l’accroissement du risque de défaut et de pertes à la suite des turbulences 
actuelles. Il est en effet essentiel que ces systèmes ne conduisent pas à une 
sous-estimation du risque. Cette actualisation apparaît aujourd’hui d’autant plus 
nécessaire que, pour les portefeuilles de prêts immobiliers, les estimations des 
paramètres de risque n’ont peut-être pas été suffisamment rigoureusement adaptées 
par tous les établissements aux spécificités de certains crédits à risque, comme les 
crédits hypothécaires américains subprime. La même chose a pu arriver dans d’autres 
pays. De manière plus générale, il apparaît utile que les superviseurs poursuivent leur 
analyse des modalités de prise en compte par les banques des caractéristiques 
propres à certains actifs financiers dont le profil de risque pourrait être plus élevé que 
celui des classes d’actifs réglementaires définies dans Bâle 2 ; 
–  Il faut aussi mieux traiter la question, essentielle pour certains actifs, comme les 
crédits immobiliers ou les financements spécialisés, de la corrélation entre les 
probabilités de défaut (PD) et les pertes en cas de défaut (LGD). Celle-ci peut être 
assez variable suivant les caractéristiques des crédits immobiliers dans les différents 
pays. Plus généralement, il est également nécessaire d’analyser plus avant les 
modalités de prise en compte par les banques, en période de crise, des garanties et 
collatéraux mis en place et notamment de la corrélation entre le risque portant sur 
l’élément couvert (ou débiteur) et celui portant sur l’élément de couverture (collatéral). 
Ceci est d’ailleurs d’autant plus important que Bâle 2 augmente très largement le 
spectre des collatéraux éligibles à une reconnaissance prudentielle ; 
– Enfin il est important d’améliorer la qualité des stress tests portant sur les 
risques de crédit, y compris s’agissant de risques de concentration, en y 
intégrant notamment les possibilités de réactions en chaîne et de contagion sur 
différents marchés. Doivent également être examinées attentivement les 
modalités de prise en compte des résultats de ces stress tests, tant par les 
banques que les autorités de contrôle, dans les systèmes de gestion et de 
mesure du risque ainsi que, le cas échéant, dans le niveau du capital économique ou 
réglementaire requis. Cela devrait également constituer l’un des éléments du pilier 2, 
 9
que j’ai déjà mentionné à plusieurs reprises et sur lequel je reviendrai un peu plus tard, 
étant donné son importance. 
Pour ce qui relève des risques de marché, il conviendra : 
– de s’assurer que les établissements ne classent leurs opérations en portefeuille 
de négociation que si elles sont effectuées sur des marchés suffisamment 
liquides ; 
– et de mieux appréhender l’ensemble des risques au sein de ce portefeuille, en 
particulier le risque de défaut dont le poids a augmenté ces dernières années, sous 
l’effet notamment d’une négociation croissante de produits structurés de crédit et de 
produits comprenant des parts de fonds spéculatifs ou hedge funds. La publication, le 
12 octobre dernier, par le Comité de Bâle de recommandations en matière de calcul de 
l’exigence de fonds propres au titre du risque de défaut ou incremental default risk 
charge, constitue à cet égard une étape importante. 
S’agissant du risque de liquidité, les turbulences financières ont mis en 
évidence la nécessité : 
– pour les banques, de revoir la manière dont le risque de refinancement peut se 
matérialiser et d’analyser ses conséquences sur d’autres risques, comme le 
risque de crédit et le risque de concentration, par exemple dans le cas du tirage des 
lignes de liquidité octroyées aux véhicules de titrisation ; 
– pour les superviseurs, de s’assurer que les banques ont bien mis en place, dans 
le cadre de leur plan de continuité et de retour à la normale, des dispositifs et 
procédures robustes en matière de gestion de la liquidité, tenant à la fois compte 
de leur propre risque de refinancement, du risque d’assèchement des marchés et 
des interactions éventuelles entre ces deux risques. Ceci est d’autant plus 
important dans le contexte du modèle originate and distribute que l’efficacité des 
instruments de transfert de risque sur lesquels ce dernier s’est développé suppose une 
liquidité suffisante à la fois des acteurs et des marchés. 
On peut d’ailleurs noter que le Comité européen des Contrôleurs bancaires (CEBS) 
ainsi que le Comité de Bâle travaillent à une révision de la réglementation actuelle relative 
à la liquidité. 
 10
Par ailleurs, en ce qui concerne les risques induits pas certaines activités 
comme la gestion d’actifs, il apparaît nécessaire de mieux appréhender les canaux 
de transmission de ces risques entre les activités pour compte propre et celles pour 
compte de tiers ainsi que les besoins de liquidité générés par ces dernières. Plus 
généralement, les modalités d’évaluation et d’appréhension de certains risques comme le 
risque de réputation ou le risque stratégique, notamment dans le cadre du pilier 2, doivent 
être développées.  
Je souhaiterais d’ailleurs souligner le rôle très important que doit jouer le 
pilier 2 aux fins de l’amélioration des pratiques de gestion des banques i) en matière 
de nouveaux risques non couverts par le pilier 1 et ii) dans des domaines que les 
superviseurs estiment, spécifiquement, susceptibles de devenir de nouvelles 
sources de vulnérabilités. En pratique, pour certaines activités, il n’existe pas encore de 
normes universellement admises de gestion des risques. Cela ne signifie cependant pas 
que les processus de gestion des risques des banques dans ces activités soient toujours 
suffisamment stricts, mais plutôt qu’il existe un large spectre d’instruments disponibles à cet 
effet, chacun avec ses avantages et ses inconvénients. Cela signifie également que les 
superviseurs ne doivent pas procéder à une évaluation mécanique de ces risques et de 
leur gestion par les banques, telle qu’elle résulterait par exemple du simple constat d’un 
intervalle de confiance statistique. L’évaluation doit être plus fine. De plus, le pilier 2 doit in 
fine servir aux fins de l’amélioration de la gestion des risques dans les domaines que les 
superviseurs estiment, à un moment donné, cruciaux pour la stabilité financière, et ce dans 
une approche prospective. 
Enfin, les turbulences financières récentes ont mis en évidence les difficultés et 
les risques liés aux méthodes de valorisation de certains instruments financiers, 
notamment les produits structurés complexes, mais également certains produits réputés 
plus simples. Il a en effet pu être observé une divergence parfois très importante entre les 
valorisations théoriques tirées de modèles et les valeurs de marché. Or, la question de la 
correcte estimation du prix des transactions complexes a pris une acuité toute particulière 
avec la généralisation progressive des évaluations à la juste valeur depuis l’entrée en 
vigueur des nouvelles normes comptables (IFRS).  
À cet égard, il apparaît nécessaire d’intégrer des hypothèses de disparition de 
la liquidité et d’accroissement de la volatilité ainsi, plus généralement, que de veiller 
au renforcement des processus de contrôle des valorisations au sein des banques. Il 
est notamment indispensable de renforcer l’examen critique, indépendant et régulier 
 11
des valorisations obtenues pour certaines positions complexes, qui semblent être 
restées trop souvent dépendantes de données externes fournies par les agences de 
notations externes ou prestataires de services, sans examen réel des caractéristiques des 
sous-jacents et des collatéraux. Il est également important de renforcer la transparence 
des banques en matière d’information relative aux méthodes d’évaluation à la juste valeur 
et de leur traduction dans les comptes de résultat.

Comme vous le constatez, s’agissant de la mise en œuvre de Bâle 2, les défis 
sont nombreux. Que ces derniers soient connus de longue date ou nouveaux, à l’instar de 
ceux apparus depuis les turbulences financières de l’été, ils doivent être relevés. Pour 
reprendre une expression, je crois, du Gouverneur LAKSACI, « le challenge est jouable » 
et, au cours de la période à venir, les autorités de contrôle bancaire doivent continuer à 
travailler à une mise en œuvre robuste et saine du nouveau dispositif. Cette mise en œuvre 
apportera en effet des améliorations significatives en matière de mesure et de gestion des 
risques, comme le confirme d’ailleurs les premiers retours des autorités ayant déjà opéré 
un passage à Bâle 2. 
Je conclurai mon propos en reprenant une formule du Secrétariat général du Comité 
de Bâle qui, me semble-t-il, illustre parfaitement l’esprit dans lequel la mise en place de la 
réforme doit être conduite dans chaque pays : « Bâle 2 n’est pas une destination mais 
un voyage ».  
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

La conduite de la politique monétaire  
en période de tensions financières 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, 
 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France,  
 
European Banking and Financial Forum 
 
Prague, 1er avril 2008 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Depuis plus de deux siècles, préserver la valeur de la monnaie et favoriser la stabilité des systèmes de 
paiement ainsi que des marchés du crédit et des capitaux constituent les deux principales 
responsabilités des banques centrales dans le monde. En temps normal, on considère que ces deux 
missions sont relativement distinctes. Cette dichotomie observée sur le plan opérationnel reflète 
d’ailleurs une situation très contrastée d’un point de vue plus académique : comme le professeur 
Goodhart l’a récemment souligné, le large consensus apparu au cours des deux dernières décennies sur 
le volet macroéconomique de l’activité de banque centrale contraste avec l’absence de consensus sur 
le cadre théorique approprié pour l’analyse de la stabilité financière et sur les meilleurs moyens de la 
garantir ou de la restaurer en cas de rupture 
1
. 
 
Lors des périodes de tensions certaines interactions apparaissent  toutefois inévitablement. C’est ainsi 
que les turbulences financières ont clairement une incidence sur l’efficacité de la transmission de la 
politique monétaire (cf., par exemple, les spreads inhabituellement importants observés sur les 
marchés monétaires depuis août 2007). À l’inverse, des décisions de politique monétaire pertinentes et 
une communication crédible devraient contribuer au dénouement ordonné des crises financières. Les 
périodes de turbulences, comme celle que nous connaissons actuellement, constituent donc de 
véritables défis, car elles nous obligent à redéfinir les moyens d’assumer notre double responsabilité.  
 
J’aborderai tout d’abord la question de la nécessaire dissociation entre gestion de la liquidité et 
décisions de politique monétaire. Je comparerai ensuite brièvement les stratégies adoptées aux  
États-Unis et dans la zone euro, avant de conclure par certains enseignements que nous pouvons tirer 
de l’expérience actuelle de tensions financières.

La conduite de la politique monétaire en période de tensions financières – Discours de Christian Noyer,  2 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France – European Banking and Financial Forum – Prague, 1er avril 2008  
Il est fondamental de dissocier la gestion de la liquidité des mesures de politique monétaire 
 
En cette période de tensions financières, une des grandes difficultés que rencontrent les banques 
centrales dans l’élaboration de leur stratégie et dans leur communication consiste à faire passer le 
message selon lequel la gestion de la liquidité, qui s’inscrit dans une perspective à court terme, peut 
être complètement dissociée de l’élaboration de la politique monétaire, qui se situe dans une 
perspective à moyen terme. En effet, dans une période de risques inflationnistes croissants, provenant 
notamment d’une demande mondiale excédentaire de matières premières et d’énergie, il est essentiel 
que notre gestion de la liquidité ne soit pas interprétée de façon erronée et ne contribue pas à une 
détérioration des anticipations d’inflation. 
 
Pour le formuler de façon très directe, l’élaboration de la politique monétaire consiste à fixer le taux 
directeur à un niveau compatible avec les objectifs macroéconomiques de la banque centrale, sans 
plus, tandis que la gestion de la liquidité consiste à permettre au marché monétaire de fonctionner 
« normalement », de telle sorte que les impulsions de politique monétaire puissent être transmises 
efficacement au reste de l’économie. Je fais référence à nos efforts visant à ramener les écarts de taux 
d’intérêt de un à trois mois à leurs niveaux habituels, faibles et stables. Il convient de noter, d’une 
manière générale, que cette gestion de la liquidité pourrait, dans une certaine mesure, ressortir à la 
fonction de prêteur en dernier ressort des banques centrales, même si l’éventail des actions possibles à 
ce titre ne se limite évidemment pas aux opérations d’open market à l’échelle du marché que nous 
avons conduites jusqu’à présent dans la zone euro (ces actions comprennent notamment l’assistance 
d’urgence ciblée accordée à un établissement de crédit illiquide) 
2
. 
 
Afin d’être plus explicite, laissez-moi rappeler brièvement un résultat standard obtenu par 
William Poole (1970) : lorsque la demande de monnaie de banque centrale est incertaine, la meilleure 
solution consiste à stabiliser le taux d’intérêt à court terme, en laissant l’offre de monnaie s’ajuster de 
façon endogène. C’est précisément ce qui s’est passé dans la zone euro au cours des derniers 
trimestres. En effet, la majorité des injections de liquidité effectuées depuis août dernier ont 
simplement répondu au souci d’aligner le calendrier et les échéances de l’offre de liquidité avec 
l’évolution de la demande durant les périodes de constitution de réserves, afin de stabiliser le taux 
d’intérêt à très court terme sur le marché interbancaire. Bien entendu, c’est toujours une tâche ardue, 
parce que l’augmentation de la demande de liquidité pour des motifs de précaution a modifié le 
comportement des banques et a rendu moins efficaces, au moins temporairement, les modèles de 
prévisions servant à calculer le besoin de liquidité de référence. Toutefois, l’Eurosystème ayant été 
price-taker lors de ces injections de liquidité, il est évident que les taux d’intérêt auxquels ces 
opérations de réglage fin et à plus long terme ont été réalisées étaient dépourvus de contenu en 
information s’agissant de l’orientation de la politique monétaire.  
 
Comparaison des mesures de politique monétaire des deux côtés de l’Atlantique 
 
Le meilleur moyen de transmettre le message selon lequel les mesures de politique monétaire et la 
gestion de la liquidité sont, tout compte fait, deux choses différentes est probablement d’effectuer une 
comparaison entre les évolutions intervenues des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Tandis que les stratégies 
de gestion de la liquidité semblent avoir été globalement identiques au cours des derniers mois aux 
États-Unis et dans la zone euro, il semble que les politiques monétaires aient assez largement divergé, 
le Système fédéral de réserve réduisant son taux objectif des fonds fédéraux de 3 % sur trois 
trimestres, pour le ramener à 2,25 %, tandis que la BCE maintenait son taux directeur au niveau 
atteint avant la crise, à 4 %.  
 
Examinons d’abord les questions relatives à la gestion de la liquidité. Il est intéressant de constater 
qu’en essayant de maîtriser la hausse des écarts de taux à court terme observés sur son marché 
monétaire (par exemple, la progression à plus de 100 points de base de l’écart OIS-BOR à trois mois 
en décembre), le Système fédéral de réserve a ajusté son cadre opérationnel, de sorte qu’il est 
                                                 
2  De récentes recherches de la Banque de France soulignent les problèmes d’aléa moral associé au choix de n’importe 
lequel de ces instruments par le prêteur en dernier ressort (cf. Ewerhart et Valla, 2007), lorsque la stratégie des 
intervenants sur le marché monétaire est explicitement modélisée. 
 
La conduite de la politique monétaire en période de tensions financières – Discours de Christian Noyer,  3 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France – European Banking and Financial Forum – Prague, 1er avril 2008  
désormais pratiquement calqué sur celui de la zone euro. En particulier, le nouveau dispositif 
d’adjudication à plus long terme (Term Auction Facility), mis en place par le Système fédéral de 
réserve à la mi-décembre, élargit à la fois l’éventail des emprunteurs éligibles, qui passent d’une 
vingtaine de primary dealers environ à toutes les banques dont la situation financière est considérée 
comme suffisamment bonne, et l’éventail des actifs éligibles pouvant être apportés en garantie à 
l’adjudication, qui vont des bons du Trésor aux obligations privées et aux titres adossés à une créance 
hypothécaire (mortgage-backed securities - MBS). Par conséquent, les injections de liquidité à long 
terme effectuées par le Système fédéral de réserve s’effectuent maintenant selon des modalités 
analogues à celles de la BCE. 
 
S’agissant des questions de politique monétaire, les importantes baisses de taux effectuées par le 
Système fédéral de réserve, comprenant deux réductions de 75 points de base, contrastent à première 
vue avec l’orientation de la BCE. Pourquoi une telle différence ? Cela signale-t-il un manque de 
réactivité de la part de la BCE en période de ralentissement économique ?  
 
Bien que fréquemment formulée, cette assertion n’est déjà pas corroborée par l’analyse des mesures 
prises dans le passé. C’est ainsi que des simulations récentes réalisées par le professeur 
Larry Christiano et ses coauteurs permettent de conclure que les mesures prises par la BCE ont été en 
fait plus efficaces pour stabiliser la production dans le sillage de la crise de 2001 (Christiano, 
Rostagno et Motto, 2007), tandis que des chocs différents et des degrés différents de rigidités 
nominales dans les deux économies expliquent des fonctions de réaction apparemment différentes des 
deux banques centrales. 
 
S’agissant de la situation présente, je pense qu’il est possible de réconcilier les deux points de vue en 
tenant compte de la nature et de l’étendue de l’incertitude macroéconomique qui entoure actuellement 
l’évolution de l’économie américaine par rapport à celle de la zone euro. 
 
L’incertitude économique à laquelle doivent faire face les responsables de la politique monétaire 
constitue toujours un problème important, mais il devient évidemment tout à fait crucial lors des 
périodes de tension. La prise en compte de cette incertitude peut inciter les banquiers centraux à 
mettre en œuvre une approche de la politique monétaire en termes de « gestion des risques ». C’est du 
moins l’opinion que le gouverneur de la Réserve fédérale, F. Mishkin, a exposé lors d’un récent 
discours intitulé Monetary policy, risk management and financial disruptions (2008).  
 
Au cours des dernières décennies, la recherche macroéconomique s’est concentrée sur deux grands 
types d’incertitude :  
 
- l’incertitude relative à l’état courant de l’économie, communément dénommée incertitude 
entourant les données,  
 
- l’incertitude concernant la structure de l’économie, qui recouvre : 1/ l’incertitude relative à 
certains paramètres clés de l’économie (par exemple, la pente de la courbe de Phillips) qui peut être 
vue comme une forme modérée de l’incertitude liée au modèle économique utilisé, certains 
paramètres variant au voisinage d’une valeur réelle inconnue ; et 2/ une incertitude plus radicale 
concernant le bon modèle à retenir dans une classe donnée de modèles (par exemple, quelle est la 
véritable probabilité de distribution des chocs, est-elle gaussienne ou non, quelle est l’amplitude des 
risques de perte extrême -tail risks- ?). Des questions comme : « Quelles évolutions non-linéaires les 
perturbations financières sont-elles susceptibles de déclencher ? » sont alors essentielles. 
 
En matière d’incertitude relative aux données, un principe de conduite général est « l’équivalent 
certain » : une règle qui est optimisée sous l’hypothèse d’une absence d’incertitude sur les données 
demeure optimale en présence de cette incertitude. En ce qui concerne les conséquences d’une simple 
incertitude sur la valeur des paramètres, on se réfère classiquement au principe de prudence de 
Brainard (1967), qui suggère que les responsables de la politique monétaire devraient réagir avec 
davantage de prudence aux chocs affectant des variables associées à des paramètres incertains dans le 
processus de transmission de la politique monétaire. Cependant, c’est sans doute à la forme plus 
radicale d’incertitude sur le modèle que les banques centrales, et en particulier la Banque fédérale de 
 
La conduite de la politique monétaire en période de tensions financières – Discours de Christian Noyer,  4 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France – European Banking and Financial Forum – Prague, 1er avril 2008  
réserve des États-Unis, sont confrontées aujourd’hui. L’incertitude concerne non seulement la valeur 
de paramètres spécifiques, mais les distributions de probabilité des variables cibles et des chocs 
peuvent également avoir varié ; les approximations linéaires standard peuvent ne plus être pertinentes. 
Concrètement, cela signifie que les banques centrales doivent déterminer quelle est la stratégie la plus 
appropriée au vu de modèles concurrents de l’économie (et éventuellement de modèles notoirement 
mal spécifiés, en raison de la nature sans précédent des événements en cours). Un examen de la 
situation en termes de gestion du risque est alors essentiel. 
 
On peut probablement comprendre plus facilement les considérations de gestion du risque si on les 
analyse en tant qu’application de l’approche dite de « contrôle robuste » que L. Hansen et T. Sargent  
ont adaptée de la littérature des sciences de l’ingénieur 
3
. Il est intéressant de remarquer que les 
enseignements tirés de ces recherches récentes tendent à déroger au principe de Brainard : dans une 
approche de contrôle robuste, une réaction plus forte aux données macroéconomiques peut être 
justifiée pour empêcher que des situations relativement improbables mais potentiellement 
désastreuses ne se produisent (par exemple une réédition de la Grande Dépression). La thèse de 
Mishkin en faveur d’une approche de la politique monétaire américaine basée sur la gestion du risque 
dans la situation actuelle apporte une solide justification aux trois dernières réductions des taux 
décidées par le Comité de l’open market du Système fédéral de réserve (de 75 points de base et 
50 points de base en janvier et de 75 points de base en mars). La connaissance approfondie qu’a le 
président Bernanke de la crise du crédit des années trente aux États-Unis (cf. Bernanke, 1983) a peut-
être également contribué à façonner cette vision selon laquelle il existe actuellement une probabilité 
non nulle d’un « équilibre fâcheux » de type endettement-déflation et qui doit être écarté par des 
mesures rapides et vigoureuses.   
 
Dès lors, une question immédiate consiste à déterminer si ces analyses sont pertinentes pour la 
conduite de la politique monétaire dans la zone euro. À l’heure actuelle, il me semble qu’elles ne le 
sont pas. Mes raisons d’être relativement plus optimiste que nos collègues américains sont de trois 
ordres :  
 
- Premièrement, des perturbations financières majeures (affectant le système bancaire) sont 
moins probables dans la zone euro qu’aux États-Unis.  Les banques européennes ne sont bien sûr pas 
à l’abri de pertes liées à leur exposition sur le marché des subprime aux États-Unis ou sur d’autres 
marchés qui se sont bloqués depuis que la crise a éclaté, mais cette exposition est en moyenne 
nettement inférieure à celle de leurs contreparties aux États-Unis et leur modèle de banque universelle 
leur permet de limiter les conséquences d’une crise affectant un compartiment de leur activité. 
 
- Deuxièmement, des observations empiriques confortent l’idée selon laquelle les conséquences 
macroéconomiques réelles de turbulences financières prolongées seraient relativement moins 
déstabilisatrices dans la zone euro. L’endettement des ménages est en effet, comparé à la situation 
dans d’autres pays, resté relativement faible dans la zone euro en général et notamment en France. En 
outre, les données disponibles font état d’une faible transmission des chocs financiers sur la 
consommation des ménages par le canal du patrimoine et de l’effet de richesse. 
 
- Enfin, les perspectives économiques à court terme sont beaucoup plus encourageantes dans la 
zone euro qu’aux États-Unis. Même si nos économies ralentissent, on ne voit pas de récession se 
profiler à l’horizon.  
 
                                                 
3
 L’idée phare du contrôle robuste est que les responsables doivent dans un contexte d’incertitude sur le modèle chercher à 
réduire au maximum les conséquences des scénarios les plus défavorables. Même si la politique requise n’apparaît pas 
optimale au bout du compte lorsqu’on observe a posteriori qu’aucun choc à grande échelle ne s’est concrétisé, une approche 
intégrant la gestion du risque revient à estimer que le coût de souscription d’une assurance contre les conséquences d’un tel 
choc est faible par rapport à l’alternative.  
 
 
La conduite de la politique monétaire en période de tensions financières – Discours de Christian Noyer,  5 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France – European Banking and Financial Forum – Prague, 1er avril 2008  
Quelques enseignements à ce stade pour la zone euro 
 
La crise n’est visiblement pas terminée et les conséquences de l’accumulation de déséquilibres 
financiers ne se sont pas encore toutes manifestées. Toutefois, après plus de sept mois, je pense qu’il 
est déjà possible de dresser un bilan. Dans mes conclusions, je tenterai de formuler des enseignements 
s’articulant autour de trois grands axes. 
 
1. Tout d’abord, s’agissant de la gestion de la liquidité, il convient de souligner que la coopération 
étroite entre les banques centrales, et notamment entre la BCE et le Système de réserve fédéral, s’est 
avérée déterminante pour atténuer les effets de la crise de confiance prolongée qui avait paralysé les 
marchés monétaires internationaux. Nos actions coordonnées avec le Système fédéral de réserve et 
d’autres grandes banques centrales, notamment la fourniture de liquidité en dollars des États-Unis 
dans le cadre d’accords de swap avec le Système fédéral de réserve, ont clairement montré notre 
détermination à agir collectivement pour restaurer des conditions normales de liquidité sur les 
marchés interbancaires. L’amélioration de la rapidité et de l’exhaustivité des échanges d’informations 
entre banques centrales, ainsi qu’entre les banques centrales et les autorités de surveillance, reste 
certainement une priorité. Je dois dire à ce dernier titre  que le modèle français de supervision 
bancaire, dans lequel les contrôleurs relèvent de la banque centrale, a démontré une nouvelle fois ses 
avantages dans le contexte actuel. 
 
2. S’agissant de la politique monétaire, je souhaite souligner que même une politique flexible 
(comme celle que peut inspirer une approche basée sur la gestion du risque « à la Mishkin ») ne peut 
être mise en œuvre, le cas échant, que si les anticipations d’inflation demeurent ancrées à l’objectif de 
la banque centrale. En d’autres termes, un ancrage solide des anticipations d’inflation reste un 
préalable à des baisses de taux en situation d’incertitude financière élevée et de risques à la baisse 
pesant sur la croissance. Je suis convaincu qu’en période de turbulences financières, il est encore plus 
nécessaire de garantir la stabilité des prix. À cet égard, le diagnostic relatif à l’état des anticipations 
d’inflation est par conséquent décisif au stade actuel. Les mesures habituelles reposant sur les données 
du marché, comme les points morts d’inflation, sont des indicateurs fiables des anticipations 
d’inflation à long terme 
4
 ; cependant, ces indicateurs s’appuyant sur le marché peuvent être faussés 
par des primes de risque ou de liquidité inhabituellement élevées en période de turbulences 
financières, ce qui signifie que nous devons être très prudents dans notre évaluation. Plus 
concrètement, cela implique que l’effondrement des taux d’intérêt réels et le redressement des points 
morts d’inflation (cf. par exemple le marché français des OATi au cours des dernières semaines) 
pourrait s’expliquer en partie par ces facteurs techniques et ne pas refléter de détérioration marquée 
des perspectives d’inflation. Mais nous devons à l’évidence rester particulièrement prudents afin de 
maintenir les anticipations solidement ancrées. 
 
3. Enfin et surtout, nous devons rester conscients du fait que les banques centrales, en tant que 
responsables de la politique monétaire aussi bien qu’en tant que prêteurs en dernier ressort, ne 
peuvent et ne doivent pas être tenues pour responsables de tout. De mon point de vue, les questions 
réglementaires liées à la multiplication des innovations financières apparues au cours du dernier 
épisode d’essor des marchés doivent maintenant figurer au premier plan des préoccupations. En effet, 
des failles réglementaires me semblent se trouver au cœur de la crise des subprime qui, comme cela a 
été souvent  relevé,  ressemble à « une flambée du crédit qui a mal tourné » 
5

sur le marché hypothécaire des subprime aux États-Unis sont statistiquement plus nombreux dans les régions ayant 
enregistré les plus fortes hausses du nombre et du montant des prêts, car celles-ci étaient liées à un abaissement des 
critères d’octroi. Cette détérioration des critères d’octroi des prêts par les banques peut à son tour s’expliquer par des 
modifications de la structure du marché (avec l’entrée de nouveaux concurrents agressifs) et par le recours accru des 
banques à la titrisation d’actifs et à la cession de prêts.

Inflation, innovation financière et politiques monétaires 
Quelques défis actuels 
Discours de Christian Noyer, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Conférence GIC et CEPII 
Mardi 13 mai 2008 
 
 
 
 
Des tensions inflationnistes sont aujourd’hui à l’œuvre dans la plupart des régions du monde. Je 
souhaiterais entamer mon propos par quelques remarques relatives à cette évolution préoccupante 
avant de me pencher sur les défis posés par l’innovation financière aux politiques monétaires.  
 
La hausse actuelle de l’inflation mondiale tranche nettement avec la stabilité des prix enregistrée au 
cours des dernières décennies.  
 
Pendant ces vingt dernières années, la mondialisation a apporté une contribution significative à la 
stabilité des prix. Avec l’intégration dans l’économie mondiale de nouveaux acteurs de taille (comme 
l’Inde et la Chine), les pays développés ont bénéficié d’importations de produits manufacturés à bas 
prix. La baisse des prix des importations a permis aux salaires réels de croître sans avoir de 
répercussions sur le coût du travail, ce qui a abaissé le taux d’inflation pour tout niveau d’emploi 
donné. Parallèlement, les effets de la mondialisation se sont fait sentir de façon plus indirecte par le 
biais d’une intensification de la concurrence, à la fois sur les marchés des produits et du travail.  
 
La dynamique de l’inflation s’est également modifiée. Parmi ces modifications, le phénomène le plus 
largement décrit et commenté est probablement l’aplatissement de la courbe de Phillips. En langage 
économique, cela signifie que l’inflation domestique est devenue moins sensible à l’écart de 
production intérieur par rapport à sa tendance; ou, en d’autres termes, qu’elle est devenue plus stable 
au cours du cycle économique.  
 
Il existe plusieurs explications possibles à ce phénomène, qui ne s’excluent pas mutuellement. Les 
anticipations pourraient être plus solidement ancrées, ce qui réduirait l’incidence de l’écart de 
production sur l’inflation courante. Il est également possible qu’en raison des réformes structurelles, 
le taux de chômage n’accélérant pas l’inflation (NAIRU) ait diminué dans de nombreux pays ces 
dernières années, donnant ainsi l’impression « visuelle » d’une horizontalité de la courbe de Phillips  
 
2 Inflation, innovation financière et politiques monétaires – Quelques défis actuels 
Discours de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France – Conférence GIC et CEPII –13 mai 2008 
 
durant cette période. Plus généralement, la mondialisation elle-même pourrait également être 
responsable de l’aplatissement de la courbe de Phillips. Dans une économie ouverte, les variations de 
la demande intérieure peuvent facilement être satisfaites par une augmentation des importations. Par 
conséquent, l’inflation domestique peut devenir moins sensible à l’écart de production intérieur et plus 
sensible aux tensions sur les capacités de production au niveau mondial. 
 
Dans l’ensemble, ces évolutions ont permis aux banques centrales de réduire plus facilement 
l’inflation sans coûts pour l’économie réelle.  
 
Mais il est manifeste, aujourd’hui, que ces effets sont en train de s’inverser.  
 
Les prix du pétrole, des produits alimentaires et des autres matières premières enregistrent en ce 
moment une rapide progression. Trois facteurs pourraient expliquer cette évolution (dont l’importance 
fait actuellement l’objet de vifs débats) : premièrement, un déséquilibre entre l’offre et la demande ; 
deuxièmement, l’émergence des matières premières en tant que catégorie d’actifs, attirant des flux 
importants de capitaux vers les fonds de matières premières ; et, enfin, l’utilisation des matières 
premières à titre de couverture contre l’inflation ou la dépréciation du dollar.  
 
En outre, même si l’offre de main-d’œuvre demeurera abondante dans les pays émergents, il n’est pas 
du tout certain qu’elle restera bon marché. On constate d’ailleurs actuellement une progression des 
prix à l’exportation dans ces pays, qui se traduit par une hausse des prix à l’importation pour les 
économies développées. 
 
Bref, l’environnement mondial est devenu très inflationniste. 
 
Pourtant, dans de nombreuses régions du monde, les politiques monétaires demeurent relativement 
permissives. Ce paradoxe peut s’expliquer par le dilemme auquel doivent faire face de nombreux pays 
qui maintiennent un lien entre leur monnaie et le dollar des États-Unis, afin d’éviter une appréciation 
non souhaitée de leur taux de change. Or, comme l’illustre le fameux triangle d’incompatibilité de 
Mundell, un pays ne peut rattacher sa devise à une autre et mener simultanément une politique 
monétaire indépendante dans un contexte de libre circulation des capitaux. Par conséquent, de 
nombreux pays émergents sont actuellement amenés à « importer » en partie la politique monétaire 
des États-Unis, bien que leur situation et leur position dans le cycle économique soient 
fondamentalement différentes. 
 
Cette situation pourrait s’avérer instable et dangereuse. Premièrement, l’appréciation du taux de 
change réel, qui se produira de toute façon, intervient sous forme d’une hausse de l’inflation plutôt que 
d’une appréciation du taux de change nominal. En effet, l’inflation s’accélère actuellement dans de 
nombreux pays émergents. Deuxièmement, au niveau mondial, les tensions inflationnistes semblent 
s’accumuler et pourraient s’accentuer encore en 2009-2010. La hausse des prix des matières 
premières, conjuguée à des politiques monétaires permissives, risque de créer une spirale susceptible, 
si on la laissait se développer, d’affecter particulièrement les pays pauvres, ceux-ci étant pour la 
plupart importateurs nets de produits alimentaires. Notre responsabilité commune et conjointe est de 
faire tout ce qui est en notre pouvoir pour éviter que cela ne se produise.  
 
 
 
3 Inflation, innovation financière et politiques monétaires – Quelques défis actuels 
Discours de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France – Conférence GIC et CEPII –13 mai 2008 
 
Je souhaiterais à présent évoquer un autre grand défi : l’incidence de l’innovation financière sur la 
conduite de la politique monétaire. Les turbulences actuelles sur les marchés de capitaux sont là pour 
nous rappeler que l’innovation financière n’est pas un processus sans heurts. Pour les banques 
centrales, il est essentiel de bien comprendre les mécanismes par lesquels la politique monétaire 
influence l’économie. Or, les innovations financières affectent ces mécanismes en modifiant les 
canaux de transmission de la politique monétaire. En m’inspirant d’enseignements tirés des 
turbulences actuelles, je souhaiterais faire les quatre remarques suivantes.  
 
Premièrement, la titrisation a créé de nouvelles incertitudes concernant les canaux de transmission de 
la politique monétaire. Il se peut qu’elle ait affaibli certains canaux et renforcé certains autres. En 
temps normal du moins, l’innovation financière affaiblit sensiblement le canal du crédit bancaire. En 
permettant aux entreprises d’avoir un accès plus large aux marchés financiers, la titrisation les rend 
moins dépendantes du financement bancaire. De la même façon, les banques ont davantage de 
possibilités d’émettre des titres de créance et s’affranchissent de la contrainte de se financer par des 
dépôts. En revanche, la titrisation renforce le canal de transmission « direct » des taux d’intérêt, un 
grand nombre d’intermédiaires financiers étant davantage dépendants de la liquidité et de son prix. 
 
Deuxièmement, l’innovation financière (dans la mesure où elle facilite la prise de risque et favorise la 
« recherche de rendement ») a peut-être renforcé l’incidence de la politique monétaire car, dans un tel 
contexte, les primes de risque sont fortement procycliques et évoluent en phase avec les taux d’intérêt. 
 
Troisièmement, ce caractère procyclique de la « prise de risque » peut entraîner des épisodes 
d’alternance d’expansion et de brusque ralentissement économiques, lorsque l’appétence des 
investisseurs pour le risque se modifie. L’innovation financière contribue ainsi à créer des asymétries 
dans la réaction de l’économie aux impulsions de politique monétaire : par exemple, la lente formation 
de bulles lors des périodes d’assouplissement monétaire suivie d’un éclatement lors des périodes de 
resserrement. Il convient de noter qu’il existe actuellement un débat pour déterminer si ce caractère 
procyclique inhérent aux systèmes financiers est amplifié par nos systèmes comptables et prudentiels. 
 
Quatrièmement, il est possible que l’innovation financière moderne crée de nouvelles discontinuités 
dans le système financier et sa dynamique. Lorsque les conditions se tendent, le processus de 
transmission qui se diffuse le long de la courbe des taux d’intérêt devient non linéaire : la brusque 
montée des taux du marché monétaire à court terme a constitué un trait marquant des événements de 
cet été. Des spreads plus importants et variables entre les taux de financement de marché (qui servent 
de référence aux taux de nombreux prêts bancaires) et les taux directeurs sont susceptibles de réduire 
l’efficacité des ajustements de taux d’intérêt lorsque ceux-ci s’avèrent nécessaires. L’innovation 
renforce également le mécanisme d’« accélérateur financier », par lequel le niveau des prix des actifs 
influence la distribution du crédit (par le biais de la valeur des garanties et, maintenant, par son 
influence sur le ratio des actifs de niveau 1 des banques), puis l’économie réelle, celle-ci ayant, à son 
tour, une incidence sur les prix et les valeurs des actifs. Cette spirale peut être orientée à la hausse ou, 
comme nous le constatons actuellement, à la baisse.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 Inflation, innovation financière et politiques monétaires – Quelques défis actuels 
Discours de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France – Conférence GIC et CEPII –13 mai 2008 
 
Dans l’ensemble, j’estime que les banques centrales ont réussi à relever ces défis au cours des dix 
derniers mois. La politique monétaire a apporté des réponses différenciées selon les pays 
industrialisés, en prenant en compte les différentes situations et perspectives économiques. Il est 
néanmoins frappant de constater la convergence progressive des dispositifs d’apport de liquidité, 
même si les modalités techniques restent, et resteront, spécifiques à chaque pays. On a constaté une 
tendance générale à l’allongement des échéances, à l’élargissement de l’éventail des garanties et de la 
liste des contreparties. Une distinction claire et rigoureuse a partout été préservée entre apport de 
liquidité, d’une part, et politique monétaire, d’autre part. Dans la zone euro, le taux directeur est resté 
inchangé, alors que, dans le même temps, de la liquidité a été apportée au marché interbancaire. En 
effet, pour l’essentiel, les injections de liquidité effectuées depuis août dernier ont eu pour objectif 
d’ajuster le calendrier et la durée des opérations avec l’évolution de la demande de liquidité durant les 
périodes de constitution de réserves, afin de stabiliser le taux d’intérêt à très court terme. Comme je 
l’ai déjà mentionné, un résultat standard de la théorie économique (l’article de William Poole publié 
en 1970) nous enseigne que quand la demande de monnaie de banque centrale est incertaine, il est 
optimal de stabiliser le taux d’intérêt à court terme, en laissant l’offre de monnaie s’ajuster de manière 
endogène.  
 
Nous sommes loin d’être en terrain totalement balisé. La conjonction de tensions inflationnistes et 
d’une instabilité financière résiduelle constituera, pour la période à venir, un véritable défi pour les 
autorités monétaires. Mais nous pouvons nous appuyer sur notre expérience et sur les enseignements 
tirés de ces derniers mois de turbulences pour essayer de piloter l’économie mondiale à travers la 
période troublée qu’elle traverse actuellement.

Money and banking conference 2009 
Banque centrale de la République argentine, 31 août - 1er septembre 2009 
 
Discours d’introduction de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Session « The G20 and the role of emerging markets in the new financial architecture » 
 
 
Je suis heureux d’introduire cette dernière session consacrée aux leçons qu’il convient de tirer de la 
crise pour l’architecture financière internationale et le rôle en son sein des économies émergentes. 
 
La transmission rapide et forte de la crise des États-Unis vers les autres pays industrialisés puis vers 
les pays émergents a clairement mis en évidence le contraste entre : 
 
- d’une part, l’accroissement de l’exposition du système économique et financier international au 
risque de crise systémique, en raison de l’interdépendance accrue entre les acteurs des systèmes 
financiers et des économies des pays avancés et émergents,  
- et d’autre part, nos instruments de prévention et de gestion de telles crises, qui se sont révélés 
largement inadaptés ou insuffisants.  
 
En conséquence, pour éviter la répétition à l’avenir d’une crise comparable, les capacités de 
prévention et de gestion des autorités publiques doivent être renforcées. Ceci implique notamment 
une réforme de l’architecture financière internationale. Pour tirer pleinement et utilement les leçons 
de la crise, l’objectif de cette réforme est clair : les mécanismes et le contenu de la coopération 
internationale doivent être revus pour favoriser la définition et la mise en œuvre d’instruments de 
prévention et de gestion des crises qui prennent mieux en compte le développement des 
interdépendances entre les systèmes économiques et financiers des pays avancés et émergents. 
 
 Dans ce contexte on ne peut que se féliciter que les chefs d’État et de gouvernement du G20, qui 
assure une représentation équilibrée entre pays industrialisés et émergents, aient convenu de donner 
une impulsion politique forte en fixant le 2 avril à Londres une feuille de route à cette réforme de 
l’architecture financière internationale. Les travaux de mise en œuvre sont désormais en cours et je 
voudrais vous proposer quelques remarques sur leur orientation actuelle dans trois domaines qui me 
paraissent essentiels pour atteindre l’objectif fixé:  
 
-   le renforcement dans un cadre multilatéral de la réglementation financière,   
- le développement de la surveillance multilatérale  
- et le renforcement de la légitimité et des moyens des institutions qui occupent une place 
centrale au sein de l’architecture financière internationale.

1. Le renforcement dans un cadre multilatéral de la réglementation financière 
 
Sur la régulation, avant de commenter les travaux de fond en cours, je voudrais d’abord souligner et 
me féliciter des évolutions intervenues récemment en termes de gouvernance des instances chargées 
d’élaborer les standards internationaux. 
 
En effet, à la suite de la décision prise au sommet de Londres d’élargir la composition du  Forum de 
Stabilité Financière, rebaptisé Conseil de Stabilité Financière (CSF), à l’ensemble des membres du 
G20, à l’Espagne et à la Commission Européenne, et de renforcer son mandat de promotion de la 
stabilité financière en développant notamment ses interactions avec les « standard setters » 
internationaux, ces derniers ont également procédé au cours des derniers mois à l’élargissement de 
leur composition pour donner une place plus importante en leur sein aux pays émergents.  
 
Il en va ainsi du Comité technique de l’OICV (Organisation Internationale des Commissions de 
Valeurs) en charge de la régulation des marchés de valeurs mobilières qui s’est ouvert au Brésil, à la 
Chine et à l’Inde, du Comité sur les systèmes de paiements abrité à la BRI, ou encore du Comité de 
Bâle sur le contrôle bancaire, qui s’est élargi à 14 nouveaux pays, pour l’essentiel des pays 
émergents.  
 
Toutefois, il faut à présent trouver le juste équilibre entre, d’une part, un mouvement légitime 
d’élargissement pour prendre en compte notre réalité économique, et d’autre part, le souci de 
conserver l’efficacité dont ont su faire preuve jusqu’ici ces organisations. Par exemple, le Comité de 
Bâle doit maintenant trouver les moyens d’adapter son mode de fonctionnement à sa nouvelle 
composition élargie, de 13 à 27 membres.  
 
Sur le fond maintenant je voudrais souligner les points suivants concernant les travaux en cours en 
matière de réglementation prudentielle, de normes comptables et de champ de la régulation: 
 
En matière prudentielle, le premier impératif est d’améliorer la qualité du capital et d’harmoniser sa 
définition, ce qui doit aller de pair avec l’extension géographique complète et rapide de Bâle II, ce 
cadre ayant précisément pour objet de garantir que les exigences en fonds propres sont 
proportionnées aux risques. Il aurait certainement été utile de le mettre en œuvre avant 2008, 
comme cela était prévu à l’origine. Sur cette base, devrions-nous ajouter à notre arsenal une mesure 
simple permettant d’évaluer l’importance de l’effet de levier afin de mieux anticiper les risques de 
formation de bulles d’actifs ? Je suis pour ce qui me concerne assez dubitatif sur ce point et ce, pour 
plusieurs raisons. Premièrement, en l’absence de normes comptables uniques, une comparaison 
entre des banques appartenant à des univers comptables différents serait dénuée de toute 
signification. Deuxièmement, ce type de ratio existait déjà aux États-Unis mais n’a été d’aucun 
secours, précisément dans le pays où la crise est apparue. Enfin, dans les circonstances actuelles, il 
pourrait accroître la réticence des banques à jouer un rôle actif de prêteurs sur le marché monétaire 
interbancaire, réduisant ainsi la liquidité du marché et accentuant davantage encore la dépendance 
excessive du secteur bancaire à l’égard de la contrepartie que constitue la banque centrale.

Cela étant, renforcer le caractère contra-cyclique des exigences en capital est essentiel. A cet effet, 
la mise en œuvre d’un provisionnement prospectif, de même qu’une exigence de fonds propres 
supplémentaire en haut de cycle seraient des mesures efficaces pour instaurer une contra-cyclicité 
des ratios. A ce propos et notamment au vu des bénéfices récemment affichés par de grands groupes 
bancaires et des importantes rémunérations annoncées pour les opérateurs, les dirigeants ou encore 
les actionnaires sous forme de dividendes, je voudrais souligner que la vocation prioritaire de ces 
profits devrait être de renforcer le capital et de permettre ainsi aux banques d’exercer leur métier 
principal, à savoir financer l’économie.  
 
Enfin, je voudrais rappeler que les règles prudentielles, qui ont été mûries au niveau international 
pendant des années et que la crise nous conduit aujourd’hui à adapter n’ont de sens et ne produiront 
les effets attendus que si l’ensemble des pays les appliquent, dont ceux qui les ont négociées en 
priorité évidemment. À cet égard, l’adoption du cadre de Bâle II par les États-Unis apparaît comme 
étant l’un des points les plus importants et les plus urgents. 
 
Les travaux d’amélioration et d’harmonisation des normes comptables me paraissent également très 
importants. Les pays du G20 ont une vision parfois différente du rôle de la comptabilité. L’un des 
points qui fait débat est notamment la valorisation en valeur de marché et le champ d’application de 
la juste valeur. Il est essentiel que les normalisateurs comptables prennent mieux en compte les 
contraintes de stabilité financière, les choix comptables n’étant pas neutres pour cette dernière.  
 
Enfin, la crise ayant montré les limites de l’autorégulation, il est également essentiel que toutes les 
institutions et tous les marchés d’importance systémique soient régulés de façon proportionnée à 
leur importance pour la stabilité financière. Toutefois la mise en œuvre de cette démarche implique 
l’adoption préalable d’une définition homogène au plan international du caractère systémique d’une 
entité, qui ne peut clairement dépendre du seul critère de taille. Elle doit également conduire à des 
règles spécifiques qui doivent être bien proportionnées et cohérentes avec les règles de portée 
générale. Ainsi, concernant les banques il conviendra de tenir compte du fait que l’importance d’un 
établissement est déjà prise en compte dans les ratios prudentiels, les exigences en capital étant par 
construction proportionnées aux expositions, et que la diversification des métiers, qui va de pair 
avec une certaine taille, peut constituer un facteur de résilience qu’il ne faudrait pas décourager. 
Confiée au FSB, il s’agit donc là d’une tache importante et délicate. 
 
2. Le développement de la surveillance multilatérale  
 
J’en viens maintenant à la surveillance collective. Sur ce point, on peut partir du constat simple 
suivant : la crise n’est pas arrivée par là où on l’attendait. Nos systèmes d’alerte, tant nationaux que 
régionaux, ont été déficients. Surtout, il nous a manqué une vision globale et transversale des 
vulnérabilités. La prise en compte des interactions entre déséquilibres macroéconomiques 
mondiaux, stabilité financière internationale et régulations et supervisions nationales a été oubliée.  
 
La crise a surpris parce qu’elle a éclaté au cœur du système, c'est-à-dire au sein du secteur financier 
américain. Contrairement aux crises financières récentes et en particulier à la crise asiatique de la fin 
des années 1990, le phénomène de contagion est parti des pays avancés, pour s’étendre au reste du 
monde. Les instruments de surveillance, notamment ceux du FMI, étaient essentiellement conçus pour 
détecter une crise de balance des paiements, alors que la crise a d’abord affecté les systèmes financiers.

Nous nous étions préparés à une crise de change, c'est-à-dire de solvabilité ou de liquidité des 
souverains ; nous avons été frappés par une crise de liquidité et de solvabilité des institutions 
financières des pays avancés. 
 
Un enseignement de la crise est donc que la surveillance doit être renforcée et être transversale, 
couvrir les aspects tant macroéconomiques que financiers ou réglementaires. Elle doit être à la fois 
macro- et microéconomique, en intégrant le risque systémique en particulier.  
 
En Europe, nous allons traiter précisément de cette question par un comité dédié, le Comité du 
risque systémique, adossé à l’Eurosystème.  
 
Au niveau mondial, le FMI et le CSF ont été invités à renforcer leur coopération pour développer 
des exercices d’alerte précoce. Toutefois, les outils de surveillance dont disposent et que peuvent 
développer les institutions internationales ne peuvent prétendre à l’exhaustivité dans l’analyse. Ce 
qui sera donc également important dans la démarche engagée, c’est la confrontation des diagnostics 
entres les institutions internationales, et avec ceux d’autres institutions multilatérales et des autorités 
nationales, afin de bien appréhender toutes les sources de vulnérabilités et les risques de contagion 
significatifs en maintenant un haut degré de vigilance collective.  
 
Ces  travaux de surveillance doivent aussi permettre d’éviter un risque de dérive qui serait 
extrêmement dommageable à mon sens : au moment où il nous faut acquérir une supervision plus 
transfrontière pour parer les risques interdépendants, le retour à une myopie nationale par le biais de 
régulations domestiques doit être banni. L’illustration est patente dans le domaine de la liquidité. 
Dans cette même optique d’ailleurs, la surveillance du secteur financier de l’ensemble des pays doit 
être améliorée dans le cadre des Financial System Assessment Programs (FSAP) et leurs 
conclusions devraient être publiées. 
 
3. Le dernier domaine de réforme qui me paraît particulièrement important concerne le 
renforcement de la légitimité et des moyens des institutions financières qui occupent une 
place centrale au sein de l’architecture financière internationale  
 
Pour fonctionner, la coopération internationale doit reposer sur des institutions efficaces et 
acceptées par tous les acteurs économiques. Cela nécessite des institutions au mandat clair, 
disposant de moyens adaptés et dont la gouvernance doit correctement refléter le monde 
économique et financier multipolaire et interdépendant qui est le notre aujourd’hui,  
 
Dans ce domaine, le G20 a donné également des impulsions fortes visant en particulier à adapter 
les moyens et leurs modalités d’actions des institutions de Bretton Woods. Ainsi, si l’on a pu 
observer une multiplication d’initiatives bilatérales, notamment des swaps accordés par les grands 
émetteurs de devises internationales, comme la Fed ou l’Eurosystème, mais aussi, dans un 
contexte très différent, par la Chine, ces mécanismes ne peuvent pas à eux seuls constituer un 
système assurantiel cohérent. C’est la raison pour laquelle le G20 a décidé le triplement des 
ressources du FMI, pour un montant cible de 750 milliards de dollars, ce qui est un événement sans 
précédent. Les instruments d’intervention ont également été réformés. Un instrument multilatéral de 
prévention et de gestion des crises a été créé, la Flexible Credit Line (FCL) ; le Mexique, la Pologne, 
l’Argentine en bénéficient déjà et il a certainement contribué à minorer les risques de contagion.

A l’adresse des pays les plus pauvres, le Poverty Reduction and Growth Fund (PRGF) a été établi. 
Il matérialise clairement la volonté du Fonds de proposer un cadre rénové d’assistance et de 
solidarité envers les pays les plus vulnérables. Dans le même ordre d’idée, l’adéquation des 
ressources des banques multilatérales de développement a été reconsidérée et, par exemple, la 
Banque Asiatique de Développement a vu son capital tripler.  
 
Ce renforcement des moyens des institutions qui sont au cœur de l’architecture financière 
internationale doit s’accompagner d’une réforme de leur gouvernance, pour conforter leur légitimité 
et leur efficacité. Pour moi qui viens d’Europe, je ne suis pas si bien placé pour vous dire ma vision 
de la gouvernance des institutions financières, et du FMI en particulier, car pour donner une juste 
place au monde émergent, c’est le plus couramment la représentation européenne qui est visée. 
Vous seriez tentés d’interpréter négativement mes suggestions. Pourtant, tout d’abord je ne pense 
pas que la place de l’Europe soit contestable : l’Europe est diverse, regroupant des petits pays, 
neufs, voire émergents, avec de grandes et vieilles nations développées. Elle reste globalement 
plutôt sous-représentée dans une enceinte toujours constituée d’États souverains. Ensuite, et surtout 
me semble-t-il, on se tromperait de débat ou de solution face aux défis actuels : quand il s’agit au 
fond d’améliorer le dialogue en vue de solutions concertées et opérationnellement applicables, je 
crois que personne ne pense vraiment assurer un meilleur avenir à notre coopération financière en 
conseillant que l’instance exécutive du FMI comporte 3 ou 4 personnes de moins ou de plus sur 24 
ou 25. 
 
 En revanche, quelques principes devraient, selon moi, présider à cet axe de réforme : la 
gouvernance doit aujourd’hui être adaptée à un monde financier multipolaire. Si chacun doit bien 
évidemment pouvoir s’exprimer à hauteur de son implication et de ses responsabilités, de manière 
bien plus pertinente que des calculs complexes sur les quotes-parts ou les règles de vote, c’est la 
question du mode de fonctionnement et du mandat du FMI qui sera essentielle. Sur ce plan, la 
désignation des dirigeants des institutions fondée strictement sur leurs compétences paraît 
particulièrement judicieuse, de même que l’élargissement du mandat du FMI. Une attention 
restreinte aux taux de change n’est désormais plus de mise, et si le Fonds doit avoir les moyens de 
contribuer à garantir la stabilité financière internationale, il devrait notamment exercer un suivi du 
compte de capital. En outre, cette contribution ne peut pas revenir à exiger de se plier à un corpus 
de règles rigide et uniforme. Elle doit prendre en compte de manière équilibrée, non seulement le 
niveau de développement de chaque pays, mais aussi le risque systémique que chacun représente au 
sein du système financier global.  
 
Symétriquement pour les États membres, cela implique une participation effective dans les instances 
multilatérales en faveur du développement du système financier international, que ce soit par 
l’ouverture du compte de capital ou la fourniture de liquidité en cas de besoin, comme la crise vient de 
le mettre en évidence avec acuité. On ne peut pas non plus éluder le rôle particulier que confère à 
certains États, voire la contrainte que fait peser sur eux le statut international de leur monnaie.  
 
Sur l’ensemble de ces questions, au-delà des lectures un peu rapides tendant à distinguer des types 
d’acteurs aux intérêts différents – les pays développés d’un côté, les émergents de l’autre –, je tiens 
à rappeler que nous avons des intérêts convergents : intimement liés en termes commerciaux 
comme en termes financiers, nous avons un intérêt collectif à participer à la surveillance des 
systèmes financiers dans un cadre multilatéral renforcé.

Pour conclure, je souhaiterais rappeler que nous devons garder à l’esprit le fait que la nouvelle 
architecture financière que nous sommes en train de définir n’a pas vocation à être figée et devra 
être progressivement adaptée aux grandes évolutions du système économique et monétaire 
international. Dans cette perspective, le développement possible d’un monde   « multi-monétaire » 
méritera une attention particulière. Le dollar américain reste bien évidemment aujourd’hui la 
monnaie internationale de référence. De même, l’euro joue un rôle prépondérant. Cependant, la 
place croissante que pourraient prendre d’autres monnaies, à condition bien sûr qu’elles deviennent 
totalement convertibles et échangeables sans aucune restriction, permet d’envisager une situation 
nouvelle dans laquelle un nombre croissant de monnaies détiendraient le statut de monnaie 
internationale. A cela s’ajoute la  possibilité d’utiliser largement une monnaie supranationale, par 
exemple le DTS, que plusieurs pays émergents appellent de leurs vœux (bien que le DTS ne 
possède, en fait, pratiquement aucune des propriétés d’une monnaie à part entière). Si le 
développement de ce monde « multi-monétaire » se confirme, sachant que le statut international 
d’une monnaie ne se décrète pas, mais résulte du choix des marchés, il conviendra  le moment venu 
de bien en tirer les conséquences en termes d’architecture financière internationale.

DISCOURS DE M. NOYER, CONFERENCES DU GIC (GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCE CENTRE)  
 
« Crise de la dette souveraine, risque de contagion et la réponse de la banque centrale » 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très  honoré d’inaugurer cette deuxième session de conférences à Paris et je voudrais 
remercier le Global Interdependence Centre d’avoir choisi d’organiser ce cycle de 
conférences d’une semaine entière en partenariat avec la Banque de France. 
Je vais présenter le point de vue d’un banquier central sur les événements récents qui ont 
affecté les marchés de la dette souveraine, les principaux risques qui leur sont inhérents et les 
défis posés en termes de stabilité financière et de processus de reprise. Enfin, j’évoquerai 
brièvement les mesures les plus récentes adoptées par les banques centrales et les pouvoirs 
publics pour maîtriser ce regain de tensions.  
Je suis convaincu que cette allocution d’ouverture suscitera des échanges nourris dans les 
groupes de discussion où d’éminents orateurs exprimeront leur point de vue chacun dans une 
optique différente : banques centrales, agences de notation, investisseurs et universitaires. 
 
Crise de la dette souveraine : origines et dynamique 
 
Les turbulences autour de la dette souveraine constituent l’épisode le plus récent d’une crise 
qui a débuté il y a plus de deux ans déjà. Certains États européens sont les nouveaux 
protagonistes d’une crise prolongée de la dette après a) les emprunts hypothécaires à risque 
(subprime) aux États-Unis, b) les institutions financières connaissant des difficultés de 
financement et c) les sociétés non financières et les ménages dans l’incapacité de financer 
leurs besoins en capitaux. Elle nous rappelle, si besoin était, que la gestion d’une crise est 
toujours une tâche délicate et potentiellement de longue haleine. Le temps est une dimension 
essentielle pour restaurer le bon fonctionnement des systèmes économiques et financiers, 
et créer ainsi les conditions de reprises autonomes.

En quelques semaines, la Grèce s’est trouvée à l’épicentre du phénomène, lorsque les doutes 
quant à la capacité du gouvernement à honorer des milliards de dettes venant à échéance 
en 2010 se sont généralisés. La défiance des marchés s’est traduite par une hausse 
spectaculaire des rendements des emprunts d’État. Alors que cette situation extrême était dans 
une large mesure limitée à un État membre, l’ampleur de ces variations de taux et des signes 
de contagion à d’autres dettes souveraines ont conduit les intervenants de marché à réévaluer 
entièrement les risques souverains à l’échelle mondiale. Dans ce processus de réévaluation 
globale, même des pays moins vulnérables ont été affectés de façon générale et soudaine par 
un élargissement très rapide des écarts de rendement, pouvant atteindre des niveaux sans 
précédent. Il n’est évidemment pas question de nier les faiblesses de certaines situations 
budgétaires. De fait, de nombreux membres du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, moi y 
compris, ont régulièrement invité les responsables de la politique économique à prêter toute 
l’attention voulue à la dynamique de la dette. Le plus surprenant a été l’intensité de la 
contagion entre États membres et d’un compartiment à l’autre des marchés financiers. 
Certains observateurs se sont inquiétés des mécanismes spécifiques qui étaient à l’œuvre, 
soulignant le rôle potentiellement déstabilisateur de la spéculation, et ont appelé à des 
mesures décisives pour en limiter les conséquences. Je reviendrai sur ce point ultérieurement.   
 
Parmi les facteurs à l’origine des faiblesses de ces pays figure au premier rang la crise 
financière. Bien entendu, le déficit budgétaire structurel de certains pays était déjà substantiel 
avant la crise, mais la crise a provoqué une détérioration considérable des situations de 
finances publiques : premièrement, par le biais du mécanisme des stabilisateurs automatiques 
qui a entraîné une baisse rapide des recettes fiscales du fait de la récession synchronisée à 
l’échelle mondiale ; deuxièmement, les déséquilibres des comptes publics ont été aggravés 
par un accroissement de la dépense publique sous l’effet de plans de relance budgétaire sans 
précédent mais également des engagements financiers importants de l’État, liés notamment 
aux injections de capitaux dans le secteur bancaire et aux dispositifs de garantie de la dette. 
Les interventions publiques ont été effectuées à grande échelle pour limiter l’étendue des 
perturbations, mais elles ont impliqué un coût et conduit à un transfert de risque du secteur 
bancaire au bilan du secteur public. Les interventions des gouvernements européens se sont 
ainsi élevées à environ 1 800 milliards d’euros, soit 14 % du PIB européen.  
 
 
 
3/8 
 
Les vecteurs de contagion potentiels de la crise européenne d’avril-mai 
 
Quelles sont les raisons à l’origine des réponses fortes et sans ambiguité des pouvoirs 
publics à la crise d’avril-mai ? Comme on l’a déjà vu dans les précédentes phases de la crise 
financière, des actions fortes et rapides des pouvoirs publics sont nécessaires pour éviter la 
contagion et les effets de second tour indésirables. A cet égard, il est indispensable de gérer 
cette crise de la dette souveraine, sous peine de voir les chocs sur les marchés souverains 
affecter en profondeur les marchés financiers, les systèmes bancaires et ainsi, l’économie 
réelle. Permettez-moi de préciser quels sont les principaux vecteurs de contagion :  
1) Considérés théoriquement comme des actifs sans risques, les emprunts d’État sont 
généralement réputés constituer des taux plancher et une référence pour la 
valorisation de presque tous les autres titres. Ainsi, une hausse des rendements 
souverains entraîne mécaniquement une hausse des coûts de financement pour tous les 
agents du secteur privé. Les taux des emprunts d’État comportent généralement de faibles 
primes destinées à compenser le risque de liquidité et de crédit. Pour une bonne 
transmission de la politique monétaire, ces primes de risque ne doivent pas atteindre un 
niveau ou une volatilité tels que le signal donné par les taux directeurs ne serait plus 
perceptible et n’atteindrait plus l’économie réelle. Au cours des derniers mois, les tensions 
se sont rapidement propagées à d’autres marchés, au point de compromettre la 
transmission de la politique monétaire, les marchés d’emprunts d’États européens étant 
devenus pour une large part la proie de dysfonctionnements. 
2) Le deuxième mécanisme de contagion passe par le système bancaire.  
Au passif, les banques sont déjà pénalisées par l’augmentation des émissions de titres 
d’emprunt public, qui exercent un effet d’éviction et contribuent à accentuer la pente de la 
courbe des rendements ; il s’agit d’un réel problème au vu de l’importance de la dette 
bancaire qui arrivera à échéance au cours des trois prochaines années et ce, alors que les 
mesures de soutien gouvernementales ainsi que les facilités offertes par les banques 
centrales doivent être progressivement retirées. Dans ce contexte difficile, la crise de la 
dette souveraine provoque une intensification des tensions sur les financements des 
banques européennes en raison de la contagion des écarts de rendement souverains aux 
écarts de rendement bancaires. Ce processus reflète la croyance traditionnelle selon 
laquelle les institutions financières domestiques ne peuvent pas être moins risquées que 
les institutions souveraines, supposées les soutenir en cas de nécessité. Au cours des sept 
derniers mois, ce fait a été confirmé par la corrélation de plus en plus forte entre les CDS 
des banques et ceux du pays où elles sont implantées. Cette situation est préoccupante 
 
4/8 
 
pour les banques, notamment en cas d’évolution rapide et brutale. Une forte hausse du 
coût de financement serait donc préjudiciable à la rentabilité des banques et 
compromettrait leur capacité à octroyer des crédits. Le financement à court terme pourrait 
également poser problème aux banques, la multiplication des dégradations de notes 
souveraines pouvant entraîner une diminution de la valeur des titres d’emprunt public 
utilisés en garantie des refinancements, que ce soit par une baisse des prix de marché ou 
par une augmentation des décotes.  
À l’actif, les banques sont exposées à une diminution brutale des prix de la dette 
souveraine provoquée par des pertes en valeur de marché sur les portefeuilles de 
négociation de titres d’emprunt public, parfois importants, qu’elles conservent à titre de 
réserve de liquidité. En outre, les banques actives sur le marché des CDS en tant que 
vendeuses de protection sont également exposées à des pertes en valeur de marché et à des 
pertes réelles en cas de restructuration de la dette (qui constitue un événement de crédit 
déclenchant le règlement du CDS). Ces pertes pourraient affaiblir l’assise en fonds 
propres des banques au moment où la pondération des risques des actifs, qui repose sur la 
qualité de signature, augmente. Ces deux facteurs amenuisent les ratios de fonds propres 
et diminuent la capacité de prêt à l’économie.  
Cela nous amène au troisième vecteur de contagion. 
3) Enfin, le canal de l’économie pourrait jouer un rôle significatif au travers des ajustements 
budgétaires nécessaires au rétablissement des finances publiques et de la crédibilité des 
pays sur les marchés financiers. La hausse de l’investissement et de la dépense publics a 
largement contribué à la croissance économique de ces derniers semestres ; leur baisse 
pourrait peser sur la reprise, même si le calibrage et la trajectoire de l’ajustement 
budgétaire sont en principe définis minutieusement afin de favoriser un 
assainissement budgétaire soutenable sans porter préjudice à une reprise 
économique durable.  
 
Des réponses fortes et explicites de la part des gouvernements européens et de 
l’Eurosystème  
Dans ce contexte, le rôle des banques centrales et des autorités a été essentiel pour rétablir la 
confiance et garantir le bon fonctionnement des marchés financiers. Capitalisant sur les 
enseignements tirés de la crise financière de 2008-2009, les gouvernements européens et 
l’Eurosystème ont rapidement adopté des mesures fortes, sans précédent et de grande ampleur 
afin de contenir ces tensions et d’empêcher leur propagation à l’économie réelle. J’évoquerai 
brièvement les actions des chefs d’État et des banques centrales. 
 
5/8 
 
Les actions des gouvernements ont permis de contenir les tensions 
1) Je soutiens d’abord les engagements pris par de nombreux pays européens de 
consolider leur situation budgétaire, étape nécessaire au rétablissement de la 
crédibilité des gouvernements et à la normalisation des marchés de la dette souveraine. 
Ainsi que l’ont récemment souligné les ministres des Finances du G20 et les 
gouverneurs des banques centrales, les événements récents ont montré l’importance de 
la soutenabilité des finances publiques : les pays confrontés à de graves problèmes 
budgétaires doivent accélérer le rythme de l’assainissement ; 
2) Deuxièmement, l’annonce d’un programme d’aide financière à la Grèce d’un 
montant de 110 milliards d’euros convenu entre la Commission européenne et le 
FMI, conditionné à l’adoption par la Grèce d’un vaste programme d’assainissement 
budgétaire, a contribué à réduire l’inquiétude des marchés. 
3) Troisièmement, afin de rétablir la confiance dans l’ensemble de la zone euro et de 
limiter la contagion, un plan de plus grande envergure a été adopté au niveau de la 
zone euro, le Fonds européen de stabilité financière, d’un montant total de 
750 milliards d’euros avec la participation financière du FMI. L’une des 
caractéristiques principales de ce mécanisme sera la possibilité de l’utiliser à bref délai 
sans faire intervenir les parlements nationaux.   
 
Enfin, permettez-moi de mettre l’accent sur les autres actions récentes de la Banque centrale 
européenne qui ont été essentielles pour répondre à la gravité des circonstances.  
Les banques centrales ont complété les actions gouvernementales par des mesures spécifiques 
et innovantes 
1) Après un examen attentif de toutes les implications de cette option, et sur la base de 
son évaluation positive du programme d’assainissement de la Grèce, l’Eurosystème a 
décidé de suspendre l’application, dans le cas des titres de créance négociables émis 
ou garantis par l’État grec, de la référence à la notation du crédit et aux prix de 
marché requise pour l’éligibilité des actifs admis en garantie. Cette décision, qui a 
démontré une fois encore la flexibilité de notre cadre opérationnel, a contribué à 
maintenir un fonctionnement normal des mécanismes de transmission de la politique 
monétaire et à réduire les tensions sur les marchés interbancaires. Elle a permis 
d’éviter les effets de seuil importants et potentiellement procycliques entraînés 
par les décisions unilatérales des agences de notation. 
 
6/8 
 
2) Ensuite, le lancement du Programme pour les marchés de titres (Securities Markets 
Programme-SMP) le 10 mai a marqué une nouvelle étape dans la réponse de 
l’Eurosystème à la crise financière. Cette mesure consiste à intervenir sur les marchés 
secondaires de titres publics et privés de la zone euro afin d’assurer la profondeur et la 
liquidité des compartiments affectés par de graves perturbations. Le programme a pour 
objectif de remédier au dysfonctionnement des marchés de titres et de rétablir un 
mécanisme approprié de transmission de la politique monétaire. Ces interventions ont 
été stérilisées puisque la liquidité injectée a été intégralement réabsorbée, neutralisant 
ainsi complètement leurs effets sur le système bancaire. Ce type d’intervention 
historique et exceptionnel s’explique par les effets de contagion liés à la volatilité 
accrue sur les marchés financiers, les risques de liquidité et les perturbations de 
marché.  
3) En outre, la BCE a réactivé, en coordination avec d’autres banques centrales, le 
dispositif temporaire d’échange réciproque de devises (lignes de swap) conclu 
avec la Fed et a recommencé à effectuer des opérations d’apport de liquidité en 
dollars afin d’alléger les tensions pesant sur les financements en dollars. La 
réactivation de cette mesure a fait suite au regain de tensions sur les marchés de 
change et met en lumière le rôle essentiel que la coopération entre les banques 
centrales a joué au cours de ces dernières années afin de préserver les transactions 
transfrontières et la stabilité financière au niveau mondial.  
 
Toutefois, même si ces mesures ont levé l’incertitude à court terme, elles pourraient s’avérer 
insuffisantes pour modifier durablement le sentiment négatif des investisseurs sur le moyen 
terme si les déficits budgétaires et la dette ne sont pas considérablement réduits. Dans ce 
contexte, les autorités européennes doivent démontrer leur niveau élevé de coopération 
ainsi que leur engagement à trouver des solutions mondiales et communes. Toute 
décision unilatérale et non coordonnée peut notamment s’avérer moins efficace et risque 
d’amplifier la volatilité des marchés.   
 
Enfin, la suppression des vulnérabilités du secteur bancaire est souhaitable pour 
atténuer les incertitudes. Une gestion efficace des risques, de la transparence et des modèles 
d’activité robustes sont essentiels pour renforcer la résistance des banques aux chocs et pour 
assurer un financement adéquat de l’économie réelle, qui favorise une croissance soutenable 
et la stabilité financière. La mise en œuvre effective et opportune des orientations du G20 
 
7/8 
 
est nécessaire pour bâtir le nouveau système international sur des fondements solides et 
stables. C’est le cas en particulier pour les dispositions du G20 relatives au marché des CDS 
et aux agences de notation.  
On ne peut nier le fait que certains produits dérivés de gré à gré (les CDS par exemple) ou 
certains types de transactions (les ventes à découvert) sont susceptibles d’exacerber les 
variations des prix ou de créer de l’instabilité, évolutions préjudiciables  à la fois aux 
émetteurs et aux investisseurs. Il peut donc être tentant d’interdire ou de limiter 
considérablement ce type d’opérations, et nous avons d’ailleurs vu que certains pays 
formulaient des propositions dans ce sens, telles que l’interdiction des contrats de CDS à nu, 
des ventes à découvert à nu en général ou la réduction obligatoire des échéances pour le 
règlement des transactions. À mon avis, ces mesures pourraient ne pas être efficaces et, pire, 
s’avérer contreproductives.  
Elles risquent de ne pas être efficaces parce que les prix des titres ne se forment pas au sein de 
contextes nationaux mais sur les marchés mondiaux. Ce qui ne serait pas possible à Paris ou à 
Francfort pourrait encore l’être à New York ou à Londres, par exemple. Elles risquent 
également d’être contreproductives car elles pourraient détourner certaines activités de nos 
marchés au profit d’autres et altérer considérablement la liquidité des titres visés par la 
restriction, puisque les investisseurs étrangers pourraient les délaisser pour se tourner vers 
d’autres opportunités.  
 
Comprenez-moi bien: cela ne signifie pas qu’il ne faut rien faire. Au contraire, plutôt que 
d’interdire et d’inciter à délocaliser certaines activités ou à contourner ces règles, je pense 
qu’il est préférable d’attirer et de superviser plus efficacement. Cela peut être fait :  
- Premièrement, en intégrant les marchés de gré à gré dans des infrastructures de marché 
réglementées et supervisées telles que les plates-formes de négociation, les répertoires 
centraux de données et les contreparties centrales. Cela signifie que tous les CDS 
souverains de la zone euro devront être compensés par une contrepartie centrale située 
dans la zone euro. Accessoirement, cela nécessite une plus grande normalisation de 
ces CDS single name. 
- Deuxièmement, en renforçant la transparence, ex ante comme ex post, afin d’améliorer 
notre compréhension du mécanisme de découverte du prix et notre connaissance des 
positions nettes réelles des institutions financières.  
- Enfin, en améliorant la gestion du risque par les agents actifs sur ces marchés et en 
s’assurant que ces pratiques sont compatibles avec leur profil de risque. Dans le cas 
 
8/8 
 
des CDS souverains, le problème ne concerne pas forcément les acheteurs, qui 
supportent en définitive des risques limités, mais plutôt les vendeurs. En fait, il faudra 
probablement instaurer une supervision spécifique des vendeurs de protection. 
 
S’agissant des agences de notation du crédit, l’accord sur le renforcement de la surveillance 
prudentielle devient une réalité avec la mise en œuvre du cadre européen concerté, qui 
confèrera  un rôle clé à l’Autorité européenne des marchés financiers (ESMA). Dans le même 
temps, il est nécessaire de réduire la dépendance vis-à-vis des agences de notation à des fins 
réglementaires, tant dans la régulation prudentielle que pour les critères d’éligibilité aux 
refinancements de la banque centrale. 
 
******************************** 
 
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure brièvement. Nous traversons encore une période très 
difficile. Le système bancaire européen semblait s’être rétabli en partie grâce aux banques 
centrales et aux politiques gouvernementales de soutien au secteur bancaire. Ce retour à la 
rentabilité doit être mis à profit pour renforcer les fonds propres de ces institutions, au vu des 
différents risques que je viens d’évoquer. Le récent regain de tensions sur les marchés 
financiers, notamment sur les marchés souverains, et son incidence sur le secteur bancaire 
nous montrent que nous ne sommes pas encore complètement sortis de la crise et que les 
actions des banques centrales sont indispensables pour accompagner la redéfinition du secteur 
bancaire, le bon fonctionnement des marchés et le retour à une reprise autonome. Jusqu’à 
présent, les mesures prises par l’Eurosystème en vue de stabiliser les marchés et de restaurer 
leur fonctionnement, ainsi que la mise en place du Fonds européen de stabilité financière, ont 
diminué les risques de perte extrême et de contagion. Cela étant, il convient de traiter les 
germes des événements récents afin de préserver la stabilité financière à long terme. En effet, 
des déséquilibres budgétaires importants subsistent et les gouvernements doivent accélérer 
l’assainissement budgétaire afin de garantir la soutenabilité des finances publiques et de 
respecter les conditions propices à une croissance économique durable. Parallèlement, il 
conviendra de traiter de façon décisive la question des institutions financières vulnérables qui 
restent trop dépendantes des mesures de soutien renforcé au crédit et de l’aide publique.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
29 septembre 2010  
 
 
La stabilité financière internationale 
 
Même si la crise financière est née dans un pays, il est rapidement apparu qu’elle était de nature 
mondiale, tant par les mécanismes à l’œuvre que par ses implications. Elle a permis de faire passer ce 
message très simple : les marchés financiers sont étroitement interconnectés au plan mondial et, par 
conséquent, stabilité financière nationale et internationale ne peuvent être dissociées. 
 
J’aimerais aujourd’hui vous faire part de mes réflexions sur la stabilité financière au niveau 
international : quelle en est la signification, doit-elle ou non constituer un objectif de premier plan 
pour les autorités, et enfin, quelles mesures convient-il de prendre et à quels instruments faut-il avoir 
recours. Les opinions exprimées ici n’engagent que moi et ne constituent pas une position officielle. 
Néanmoins, comme vous le savez, l’année prochaine la France assurera la présidence du G20 et, en 
gardant cela à l’esprit, je vais m’efforcer de vous présenter mes propres réflexions. 
 
La stabilité financière internationale : qu’est-ce que cela signifie ? 
 
Au cours des dernières décennies, l’accroissement de l’intégration financière a conduit à une plus 
grande réallocation de l’épargne d’un pays à l’autre. Le développement des flux bruts et nets de 
capitaux a été spectaculaire. De ce fait, les déséquilibres des comptes courants se sont aggravés tant 
par leur ampleur que par leur persistance. En fait, ils sont devenus une constante de notre 
environnement économique. Nombre d’analystes soutiendraient que ces déséquilibres soient la cause 
première de la crise. Je n’irai pas jusque-là. Mais il semble raisonnable de considérer que la crise et les 
déséquilibres eux-mêmes ont certaines causes en commun.  
 
Les flux de capitaux internationaux ont rendu les pays de plus en plus interconnectés et 
interdépendants. Dans le même temps, notre environnement international  a connu des transformations 
radicales au cours de la dernière décennie. Le système monétaire et financier est devenu 
« multipolaire ». Un nombre croissant de pays, tant développés qu’émergents, sont devenus des 
intervenants actifs sur les marchés financiers mondiaux. Alors qu’il existe actuellement trois grands 
blocs de devises, dans l’avenir au moins une devise supplémentaire d’importance systémique (le 
renminbi chinois) s’imposera, et elle pourrait elle aussi, être suivie par d’autres devises 
Les participants au système financier international sont de plus en plus diversifiés du point de vue de 
leur structure économique, de leur démographie, de leur niveau de développement et, ce qui est plus 
important, de leurs choix et préférences sur le plan social. Par exemple, des taux d’épargne différents 
peuvent être considérés comme la résultante de préférences temporelles divergentes. De la même 
façon, la diversité des régimes de compte de capital peut, dans une certaine mesure, refléter des choix 
et des arbitrages différents entre efficacité et stabilité des infrastructures financières.  
 
Ces caractéristiques sont appelées à perdurer. Un grand nombre de pays différents, ayant des 
préférences différentes, seront en permanence liés et interdépendants par le biais de marchés de 
capitaux internationaux actifs et en expansion.  
 
Il n’est pas évident, à ce stade, de déterminer ce qu’il adviendra au final de la coexistence et de 
l’interaction entre les systèmes financiers nationaux au plan mondial. Au-delà de la volatilité à court 
terme, la vraie question est de savoir si cette architecture sera propice à une répartition efficace et 
stable des capitaux à long terme ou si, au contraire, elle va entraîner une accumulation de déséquilibres 
et des accès répétés d’instabilité.  
 
Selon la vision optimiste proposée par l’approche « Bretton Woods II », la configuration des 
mouvements internationaux de capitaux résulte d’un équilibre répondant à l’intérêt mutuel de deux 
groupes de pays. D’un côté, les économies émergentes suivent une stratégie de développement tiré par 
les exportations et cherchent à empêcher l’appréciation de leur taux de change réel en intervenant 
constamment sur les changes (et en contrôlant les mouvements de capitaux). Par conséquent, ils 
acceptent d’accumuler des stocks croissants d’actifs liquides libellés en dollars. De l’autre côté, les 
États-Unis sont satisfaits d’engranger des entrées de capitaux pour financer leurs déficits et de se 
procurer des importations bon marché pour alimenter leur demande de biens de consommation. Cet 
équilibre est stable grâce aux avantages mutuels qu’il confère aux deux groupes. En outre, plus il se 
prolonge, plus il devient difficile à modifier, les deux groupes devenant interdépendants en raison du 
stock de créances et de dettes qu’ils ont accumulé l’un envers l’autre. Cet « équilibre financier de la 
terreur » est censé faire durer le système sur une longue période. 
 
La théorie de la « pénurie d’actifs » offre une explication plus récente, et pessimiste, selon laquelle le 
monde connaît une pénurie d’actifs liquides et sans risques. En outre, l’offre de ces actifs est distribuée 
de façon asymétrique entre les régions, les États-Unis fournissant une part importante du total. Il existe 
donc une demande excédentaire structurelle de titres libellés en dollars, qui entretient des entrées 
permanentes de capitaux, provenant des économies émergentes, aux États-Unis. 
 
Cette approche a d’importantes conséquences. 
 
Elle montre pour quelles raisons, depuis plus d’une décennie, il existe un afflux continu de capitaux 
« montants » des pays pauvres vers les pays riches, les excédents des comptes de transactions 
courantes des économies émergentes se reflétant dans les déficits croissants observés aux États-Unis. 
 
Elle permet aussi d’expliquer pourquoi les asymétries constatées entre les pays en matière de 
développement financier entraînent à la fois des déséquilibres des paiements et des bulles spéculatives. 
Comme le système financier américain ne produisait pas suffisamment d’actifs sûrs « authentiques », 
le secteur financier a été incité à fabriquer de tels actifs par la titrisation d’actifs de qualité inférieure, 
au prix d’une fragilité financière fortement accrue (mais qui n’était pas visible). Cette fragilité est 
devenue apparente lorsque l’ensemble de l’architecture de la titrisation s’est effondré sous le poids des 
excès en matière d’endettement et de transformation d’échéances. 
 
 Le fait est que  stabilité financière interne et stabilité financière externe constituent les deux facettes 
d’un même problème. Les imperfections financières nationales d’une part et les distorsions des flux 
internationaux de capitaux de l’autre interagissent les unes avec les autres pour créer et amplifier les 
déséquilibres. En fin de compte, l’instabilité financière est le produit de cette situation via ces 
interactions. Les liens financiers internationaux peuvent donc être une source de fragilité accrue pour 
nombre d’économies nationales, y compris les plus grandes. 
 
La stabilité financière internationale : Quelle est son importance ? 
 
L’instabilité financière internationale se manifeste via différents canaux. Il est difficile d’évaluer son 
incidence. Les opinions peuvent différer sur la question de savoir si la volatilité affectant les flux de 
capitaux et les taux de change est excessive ou si elle ne fait que refléter les variations des 
fondamentaux. De même, les mouvements des prix des actifs ou des matières premières peuvent être 
considérés comme reflétant l’équilibre des forces de l’offre et de la demande, ou bien comme le 
produit d’une activité spéculative. 
 
Le comportement de la plupart des pays pendant la crise, toutefois, indique clairement qu’ils se sont 
sentis menacés par l’instabilité des flux de capitaux et ont, par conséquent, cherché à se protéger de ses 
conséquences. 
 
En particulier, la fourniture de liquidité internationale a été gravement perturbée pendant la crise. Les 
pays émergents (et certains pays industrialisés) ont souffert de graves pénuries de liquidités en dollars 
auxquelles il a fallu remédier, entre autres, par un maillage de swaps cambistes entre banques 
centrales. La crise rappelle avec acuité que la liquidité, tant nationale qu’internationale, ne peut jamais 
être tenue pour acquise. Dans le monde actuel, la plus grande partie de la liquidité internationale est 
fournie par des opérateurs privés et représentée par des créances sur des institutions privées. Les 
marchés interbancaires jouent un rôle essentiel dans ce processus. Plus l’intégration des marchés 
progresse sur les échéances les plus courtes, plus la liquidité internationale est fournie par le secteur 
privé. 
 
L’importance des conditions de la liquidité privée mondiale a été mise en évidence au cours de la 
période qui a suivi la faillite de Lehman Brothers. On a observé, dans le monde entier, un recul 
étonnamment simultané de la production et des échanges commerciaux. À l’époque, il semblait naturel 
de supposer que les formes « traditionnelles » de contagion, via les marchés des biens ou les marchés 
financiers, étaient à l’œuvre. Les responsables de la politique économique considéraient que le 
financement du commerce international constituait un canal de transmission majeur. Toutefois, la 
contagion prend du temps et ne peut expliquer entièrement la synchronisation exceptionnelle du recul 
de la production. Rétrospectivement, ce phénomène peut plutôt être assimilé à un choc global de 
liquidité. L’offre nette de liquidité s’est asséchée au même moment dans le monde entier. Les banques 
internationales ont été soudainement confrontées à une importante pénurie de dollars. Les entreprises 
ont entrepris de thésauriser de la liquidité. L’investissement et une partie de la production ont été 
brutalement stoppés. 
 
Lorsqu’un tel choc se produit, la fourniture publique de liquidité doit se substituer à la fourniture 
privée. Dans un contexte national, c’est la fonction du prêteur en dernier ressort. Mais quand la 
pénurie concerne la liquidité en devises, ce rôle doit être joué par les réserves de change. 
 
Après la crise 1997-98, les pays émergents ont constamment cherché à accroître leurs réserves de 
change. Le ratio moyen de réserves des marchés émergents a plus que quintuplé, passant de 4 % à plus 
de 20 % du PIB depuis 1990. Il est toutefois impossible d’affirmer que l’équilibre est atteint et que la 
demande de réserves se stabilisera. Au contraire, il est fort probable que cette tendance persistera, 
voire qu’elle s’amplifiera, à la suite de la crise. 
 
Cela peut sembler peu souhaitable, mais également inévitable compte tenu de l’architecture financière 
actuelle. Aucun montant de réserves ne protègera intégralement une économie financièrement ouverte 
contre un choc systémique. Il est intéressant de noter que des pays, comme la Corée du sud, qui 
détenait un volume de réserves considérable avant la crise et qui est dotée d’un régime de change 
flexible, ont néanmoins ressenti le besoin de conclure des swaps  avec le Système fédéral de réserve. 
 
Au cours de la crise, les réserves de change ont été utilisées pour assurer la stabilité financière interne, 
autant qu’externe. Les banques centrales nationales, notamment en Amérique latine, ont joué le rôle de 
prêteurs de dollars en dernier ressort à l’égard de leurs banques nationales. Cette fonction est appelée à 
se développer et aura nécessairement une incidence sur la demande de réserves. L’ouverture et 
l’intégration financières signifient que les banques nationales s’engageront de plus en plus dans des 
opérations en devises. L’expansion de leurs bilans internationaux augmentera la demande potentielle 
d’un soutien en liquidité en cas de choc. Cette tendance doit être acceptée comme une conséquence 
normale de l’ouverture des marchés de capitaux et de l’internationalisation de l’activité bancaire, 
conjuguées à la prédominance d’un nombre très limité de devises dans la finance internationale.  
 
Un enseignement d’ordre général peut être tiré de cette expérience. Dans le contexte actuel, il existe  
un arbitrage inévitable entre ouverture financière, d’une part, et nécessité d’une protection contre la 
volatilité financière  provenant de l’extérieur , d'autre part. Pour l’avenir, il est essentiel de savoir si 
nous pouvons améliorer cet arbitrage et éviter les coûts et les distorsions liés à l’augmentation des 
réserves de change et/ou à de nouvelles restrictions de la mobilité internationale des capitaux. 
 
La stabilité financière au niveau international : Que faut-il faire ? 
 
Pour les dix prochaines années, on peut envisager deux scénarios différents de l’évolution du système 
financier international. 
 
Les marchés financiers pourraient connaître un processus de fragmentation progressive et partielle : 
dans de nombreuses régions du monde, il n’y aurait pas d’ouverture importante du compte de capital. 
Au contraire, de nouvelles barrières pourraient être érigées, soit sous la forme de contrôles « souples » 
des mouvements de capitaux, soit sous la forme de réglementations nationales contraignant les 
institutions financières à cantonner les réserves locales de capital et de liquidité. La convergence des 
systèmes financiers et des réglementations nationales serait faible. Les réserves de change 
continueraient de croître, tant en valeur absolue qu’en pourcentage du PIB mondial.  
 
Ce scénario peut être considéré comme la seule réponse réaliste à la diversité accrue qui caractérise un 
monde multipolaire. Toutefois, il est difficile d'en prévoir les conséquences systémiques. Dans un tel 
environnement, les déséquilibres des comptes de transactions courantes seraient à la merci des actions 
et des politiques publiques. La concurrence réglementaire déterminerait la localisation des activités 
financières et la répartition de l'épargne. En l’absence d’un certain nombre de « règles du jeu », des 
tensions apparaîtraient naturellement entre les pays, sur de nombreux aspects de leurs politiques 
macroéconomiques nationales et internationales.  
 
Le scénario opposé verrait l’ouverture progressive de tous les comptes de capital, s’accompagnant 
d’une certaine convergence (plus ou moins intensive) entre systèmes financiers et réglementations. 
Cela permettrait l’émergence d’un marché financier mondial unifié, une répartition efficace de 
l’épargne entre les pays et un financement ordonné des déséquilibres des comptes de transactions 
courantes. L’expérience montre toutefois qu’un système financier international ouvert n’est pas stable 
par essence et qu’il dépend donc fortement de la solidité des infrastructures.  
 
Deux éléments de ces infrastructures semblent particulièrement importants. 
 
Premièrement, les pays pourraient parvenir à une convergence de vues s’agissant des éléments et des 
principes fondamentaux régissant le développement et la réglementation de leurs marchés financiers. 
Une harmonisation totale n’est ni souhaitable ni réalisable. Les divergences induites par les choix 
politiques peuvent s’avérer très déstabilisantes et entraîner une diminution du bien-être. Il doit être 
possible de s’entendre sur les principes fondamentaux régissant, par exemple, les régimes de compte 
de capital, le traitement et la résolution des institutions financières opérant au niveau international, la 
garantie des dépôts ainsi que l'organisation et le fonctionnement des marchés de titres. Les divergences 
en matière de développement financier sont une réalité. Certaines sont le reflet de véritables choix et 
préférences sur le plan social qu'il convient de respecter et de prendre en compte. D’autres résultent de 
distorsions délibérées ou involontaires induites par les décisions politiques, distorsions qui auraient dû 
être réduites ou éliminées. Dissocier ces deux sources de divergences en matière de développement 
financier doit constituer une priorité dans l’agenda international. 
 
Deuxièmement, la recherche d’un « filet de sécurité financier » efficace et puissant doit être 
poursuivie. Stabiliser la demande de réserves internationales présenterait de très nombreux avantages 
en termes de prospérité mondiale. Actuellement, un pays ne peut accumuler des réserves qu’en 
associant un excédent de sa balance des paiements à un certain degré d'intervention sur les marchés de 
change. De plus, si la stérilisation s’avère difficile ou impossible, une telle accumulation conduit 
également à des modifications non souhaitées de la politique monétaire. Bien que légitime, 
l’accumulation de réserves de précaution a inévitablement des effets secondaires sur les politiques 
macroéconomiques nationales ainsi que des répercussions sur les autres pays. Tous les pays ont donc 
un intérêt commun à trouver les moyens de déconnecter l’accumulation de réserves de la gestion des 
taux de change et, plus généralement, des situations des balances des paiements et des politiques 
monétaires. 
 
Les difficultés sont toutefois considérables. La recherche de nouvelles sources de liquidité par le biais, 
par exemple, de mécanismes multilatéraux, se heurte inévitablement à un problème d’aléa moral. 
Premièrement, pour être équivalente à des réserves, la liquidité multilatérale doit être disponible ex 
ante et sans conditions. Deuxièmement, une liquidité totalement inconditionnelle risque d’être utilisée 
pour faire face à des déséquilibres fondamentaux de « solvabilité ». Un équilibre délicat devra être 
trouvé, soit dans le cadre des facilités actuelles du FMI, soit en mettant en place de nouveaux 
mécanismes innovants.  
 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure. Je suis conscient d’avoir soulevé davantage de questions que je 
n’ai apporté de réponses. Je sais également que nombre des sujets évoqués font l’objet de vifs débats 
et sont souvent controversés, ce qui est normal. Personne ne peut prétendre comprendre parfaitement 
la dynamique du nouveau monde financier auquel nous serons confrontés au cours des décennies à 
venir. Nous savons également qu’après une crise de cette ampleur, « le statu quo » n’est pas une 
solution. Les trois dernières années ont montré à quel point les pays sont interdépendants. L’inaction 
serait inexcusable et il existe, au contraire, de nombreuses possibilités de coopérer et de bâtir ensemble 
un système financier international meilleur et plus sûr. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Politique monétaire et politique macroprudentielle 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Conférence sur « L’avenir de la politique monétaire » 
Banque d’Italie, Rome, 30 septembre – 1er octobre 2010 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de participer aujourd’hui à cette conférence organisée 
conjointement par la Banque d’Italie, l’Institut Einaudi et la Banque de France, au cours de 
laquelle ont été proposées de nombreuses idées stimulantes sur les évolutions futures des 
cadres de politique monétaire. Je commencerai mon intervention par quelques réflexions sur 
la relation entre les objectifs de stabilité des prix et la stabilité financière, avant d’examiner 
plusieurs questions relatives à la mise en œuvre conjointe des politiques monétaires et 
macroprudentielles et à leur interaction. 
I. Considérations générales sur la relation entre stabilité financière et stabilité des prix 
L’expérience des dernières décennies et, si l’on remonte beaucoup plus loin, l’histoire 
économique, nous fournissent un point de vue intéressant sur la relation entre stabilité des 
prix et stabilité financière : 
2 2
Premier point, la stabilité des prix n’est pas une condition suffisante pour assurer la 
stabilité financière mais, deuxième point, elle est nécessaire.  
Troisième point, si les autorités responsables de la politique monétaire  ont intérêt au 
maintien de la stabilité financière, c’est essentiellement parce que l'instabilité financière peut 
engendrer des « risques extrêmes » pour la stabilité des prix. 
Permettez-moi de développer ces points successivement. 
 
A – La stabilité des prix n’est pas suffisante pour assurer la stabilité financière. 
Les deux décennies qui ont précédé la crise financière ont été caractérisées, dans le monde 
développé, par une inflation à la fois faible et stable, et par une croissance de la production 
exceptionnellement stable au regard des évolutions passées. Ce n’est pas par hasard, en effet, 
que les macroéconomistes ont qualifié ces années-là de période de « Grande modération ». 
Dans le même temps, toutefois, comme cela a été abondamment démontré notamment par la 
BRI dans plusieurs études perspicaces et précoces1, ces années ont également été 
caractérisées, si on les compare à la précédente période qui a suivi la seconde Guerre 
mondiale, par la survenue nettement plus fréquente de bulles des prix d’actifs suivies de 
krachs.  
Dans une perspective à plus long terme, il apparaît clairement que les phases d’envolée et de 
chute des prix d’actifs dans un contexte de stabilité des prix, loin d’être l’exception au cours 
de la période de Grande modération, ont été en réalité relativement courantes. Avant le 
déclenchement de la Première guerre mondiale, les étalons métalliques avaient dominé 
pendant des siècles, garantissant un degré de stabilité des prix pratiquement inimaginable au 
                                                 
1 Cf. notamment, Claudio Borio et William White (2203), Wither Monetary and Financial Stability? The 
Implications of Evolving Policy Regimes, présenté lors du Symposium Monetary Policy and Uncertainty: 
Adapting to a Changing Economy, organisé par la Banque de réserve fédérale de Kansas City, Jackson Hole, 
Wyoming, 28-30 août 2003

regard des critères actuels. Pour ne donner qu’un seul exemple, en Angleterre, le niveau des 
prix en 1661, cinq ans avant le Grand incendie de Londres, était pratiquement le même que 
celui observé en 1913, un an avant l’effondrement de l’étalon-or international. Malgré cette 
remarquable stabilité des prix, les régimes d’étalon métallique ont été touchés à plusieurs 
reprises par des crises financières et des phases d’envolée et de chute des prix d’actifs, depuis 
la Bulle des Mers du sud en 17202 jusqu’à la « Panique de 1907 », qui n’a pu être enrayée que 
par l’intervention vigoureuse de John Pierpont Morgan et qui a finalement convaincu les 
autorités américaines de la nécessité de créer une banque centrale.  
Mais pourquoi les régimes monétaires qui assurent une forte stabilité des prix devraient-ils 
être vulnérables aux bulles des prix d’actifs et aux krachs financiers ? Une perspective à long 
terme laisse penser que les systèmes bancaires ont tendance à générer périodiquement des 
bulles des prix d’actifs, même sous des régimes monétaires radicalement différents. Qu’il 
s’agisse d’une croissance excessive du crédit qui dure plusieurs années ou des crises 
financières d’autrefois, l’exposition croissante de certaines institutions financières à la 
volatilité des prix des actifs a entraîné à de nombreuses reprises une crise financière. 
L’expérience antérieure à la Première guerre mondiale, période de stabilité des prix jamais 
égalée depuis lors, aurait dû nous rappeler à tous, intervenants de marché ou décideurs, que la 
stabilité des prix ne constitue pas une police d’assurance tout risque contre l’instabilité 
financière.  
 
B – La stabilité des prix est nécessaire à la stabilité financière 
Le cas le plus flagrant dans lequel l’instabilité des prix entraîne automatiquement une 
instabilité financière est celui de la déflation, par le biais du mécanisme de la « déflation par 
                                                 
2 Cf. Richard Dale (2004), The First Crash: Lessons from the South Sea Bubble, Princeton University Press 
4 4
la dette » identifié à l’origine par Irving Fisher pour expliquer la Grande dépression3. Un 
exemple plus récent de ce phénomène est celui du Japon, où la déflation persistante dont 
souffre le pays depuis le début des années quatre-vingt-dix a systématiquement entraîné, 
toutes choses égales par ailleurs, un alourdissement du fardeau de la dette des ménages ayant 
contracté des prêts hypothécaires durant la phase d’essor de la fin des années quatre-vingt et 
la détérioration des bilans des banques. De manière symétrique, une inflation élevée, qui, 
historiquement, a également toujours été synonyme d’inflation volatile, menace les 
fondements mêmes du système financier car elle entraîne une redistribution capricieuse et 
imprévisible de la richesse entre les établissements débiteurs et créditeurs. L’exemple le plus 
flagrant d’un tel phénomène est celui des épisodes d’inflation très élevée, ou hyperinflation, 
comme ceux qui ont frappé une grande partie des nations belligérantes après la Première 
guerre mondiale. Le cas de la Grande inflation des années soixante-dix, bien que moins 
dramatique, est tout aussi instructif.  
Dans l’ensemble, les données historiques nous amènent donc à conclure que, même si elle 
n’est pas suffisante, la stabilité des prix est en fait une condition préalable indispensable à la 
stabilité financière.  
J’aborde à présent un dernier point concernant la relation entre stabilité financière et stabilité 
des prix, à savoir la nécessité de préserver la stabilité du système financier afin de prévenir 
l’apparition de risques extrêmes pour la stabilité des prix. Je commencerai par examiner les 
risques à la baisse, c’est-à-dire la possibilité que l’économie tombe dans une spirale 
déflationniste, avant d’évoquer les risques à la hausse.  
C. La nécessité de préserver la stabilité du système financier afin de prévenir l’émergence de 
« risques extrêmes » pesant sur la stabilité des prix 
                                                 
3 Cf. Irving Fisher (1933), The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions, Econometrica, vol. 1(4) p.337-357 
5 5
Nous trouvons les meilleures illustrations de ce type de risques à la baisse associés aux crises 
financières dans l’expérience historique des États-Unis, au cours de la Grande crise qui a suivi 
l’effondrement du marché boursier et l’éclatement des bulles immobilières de la seconde 
moitié des années 1920, ainsi que dans l’expérience du Japon, à la suite de l’effondrement de 
la bulle immobilière durant la seconde moitié des années 1980. Dans les deux cas, une 
augmentation spectaculaire du crédit a alimenté des bulles qui ont entraîné les prix des actifs 
vers des sommets vertigineux. Dans le cas des États-Unis durant les années 1920, notamment, 
cette expansion du crédit est intervenue dans un contexte d’euphorie liée à la conviction que 
l’on était entré dans une « nouvelle ère », elle-même suscitée par la spectaculaire vague 
d’innovations technologiques ayant déferlé sur le pays au cours de cette décennie4.  
La tentative, de la part du Système fédéral de réserve récemment créé, de dégonfler lentement 
les prix des actifs par le biais de hausses des taux d’intérêt a eu l’effet inverse, entraînant le 
krach de 1929, avec pour corollaire la destruction d'un montant stupéfiant de patrimoine 
financier, et l’injection dans l’économie d’une bonne dose d’incertitude. Cette évolution a, à 
son tour, paralysé une part importante des décisions de dépense, jouant ainsi un rôle clé dans 
le déclenchement de la dépression des années 1930 et de la spirale déflationniste qui en a 
résulté5.  
Que pouvons-nous conclure de cette brève digression? Lorsqu’il a lancé la révolution 
économique qui a libéré l’activité en Chine et a finalement propulsé le pays parmi les 
puissances mondiales, Deng Xiaoping a, dans un discours célèbre, exhorté ses compatriotes à 
« Rechercher la vérité dans les faits »6, en complète opposition avec l’approche idéologique 
qui avait dominé jusque-là. Dans le contexte actuel, les faits sont clairs : d’une part, la 
stabilité des prix est une condition nécessaire à la stabilité financière, même si elle n’est en 
                                                 
4 Sur cette question cf. la discussion présentée par Robert Shiller, Irrational Exuberance, Princeton University 
Press (2000) 
5 Cette thèse a été argumentée de façon convaincante par Christina Romer, The Great Crash and the Onset of the 
Great Depression, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 105 (août 1990) 
6 D’après une citation de John Lewis Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History, Penguin Press (2005) 
 
6 6
aucun cas une condition suffisante ; d’autre part, un motif essentiel pour préserver la 
stabilité du système financier consiste à éviter de faire peser des risques potentiellement 
importants sur la stabilité des prix, dans un sens ou dans l'autre. J’aimerais maintenant aborder 
quelques questions relatives à la mise en œuvre conjointe des politiques monétaire et 
macro-prudentielle ainsi qu’à leur interaction. 
II. Questions relatives à la mise en œuvre conjointe des politiques monétaire et 
macro-prudentielle ainsi qu’à leur interaction 
Nous sommes actuellement en territoire inconnu. Le nouveau dosage de politiques 
macroéconomiques ainsi que l’élaboration de politiques macro-prudentielles sont en cours de 
développement en ce moment même. Certains aspects sont d’ores et déjà clairement établis: 
nous avons deux objectifs (la stabilité des prix et la stabilité financière), ce qui signifie, sur la 
base de l’analyse économique standard, qu’il nous faudra deux instruments distincts pour les 
réaliser. Par ailleurs, toujours sur la base de l’analyse standard, l’affectation de tel ou tel 
instrument à l’un et l’autre de ces objectifs devrait se fonder sur le principe de l’efficacité 
comparative. La politique monétaire est l’instrument naturel pour atteindre la stabilité des 
prix. Le fait que les banques centrales aient réussi à stabiliser l’inflation depuis 1995 conforte 
largement cette thèse. Les politiques macro-prudentielles (définies comme un ensemble de 
politiques visant à limiter à la fois la croissance excessive du crédit et l’accumulation de 
risques systémiques au sein du système financier) devront, quant à elles, préserver la stabilité 
financière. À partir de là, toutefois, les choses deviennent moins clairement définies et, 
parfois, véritablement complexes.  
En premier lieu, les deux objectifs sont qualitativement différents. D’une part, la stabilité des 
prix est très facile à définir et à mesurer en termes d’indice spécifique des prix. Par 
conséquent, il est relativement facile de communiquer sur la politique monétaire, et ses 
performances peuvent être évaluées assez simplement. De son côté, la stabilité financière est 
7 7
beaucoup plus floue, car il s’agit de prévenir l’accumulation de risques systémiques, la 
formation de distorsions persistantes des prix des actifs (parfois appelées bulles)… Elle ne 
peut donc pas être définie simplement, en se référant (dans le cas extrême) à un indicateur 
unique et sa communication et son évaluation sont nécessairement plus complexes. 
En second lieu, l’interaction inconnue entre ces deux politiques est essentielle. D’une part, la 
pensée récente a souligné comment la politique monétaire peut contribuer à semer les graines 
de l’instabilité financière future. La faiblesse des taux d’intérêt, par exemple, peut contribuer 
à l’accumulation de déséquilibres financiers par le canal de la « prise de risque »7. Pour 
l’exprimer simplement, des taux d’intérêt très faibles peuvent inciter les banques à prendre 
davantage de risques. Des travaux de recherche récents ont fourni des éléments empiriques 
allant dans ce sens en montrant8, par exemple, comment des mesures, fondées sur le marché, 
des risques bancaires perçus par les intervenants sur les marchés financiers tendent à réagir de 
façon positive aux variations des taux d’intérêt : une baisse des taux conduit les investisseurs 
à percevoir les banques comme moins risquées. De la même manière, plusieurs études9 ont 
montré que les critères d’octroi des prêts sont liés au niveau des taux d’intérêt : lorsque ces 
derniers sont plus bas, notamment, les critères d’octroi s’assouplissent, y compris pour les 
clients perçus comme présentant un risque de crédit plus élevé. Sur le plan théorique, les 
travaux de recherche effectués à la Banque de France10 ont montré que, lorsque 
l’environnement réglementaire n’est pas transparent, une baisse du niveau du taux d’intérêt 
réel accentue le comportement de prise de risque des banques, en partie en raison de la 
sous-évaluation des risques, classique lors de la hausse des prix des actifs.

Transmission Mechanism?, document de travail de la BRI n° 2588, décembre 2008

Taking?, document de travail de la BCE n° 1166, mars 2010

Taking Channel of Monetary Policy, Banque de France, ronéo (2010) 
8 8
Un autre risque, identifié par Raguram Rajan11, est que la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt conduit 
les banques à mener une stratégie de « recherche du rendement » afin de maintenir un taux de 
rendement souhaité (ou même imposé de façon institutionnelle). Selon un principe bien établi 
en matière de finance, le seul moyen d’accroître le taux de rendement attendu, toutes choses 
égales par ailleurs, est de prendre davantage de risque : les banques augmentent donc leur 
exposition au risque.  
Un autre canal par lequel des taux excessivement bas ont pu contribuer à l’accumulation des 
déséquilibres financiers durant la période précédant la crise a trait à la priorité accordée par 
les banques centrales à la hausse des prix des biens, plutôt qu’à celle des prix des actifs. Au 
cours d’une période caractérisée par des chocs d’offre importants et favorables provenant de 
l’intégration de grands pays en développement dans l’économie mondiale, les pressions 
déflationnistes qui en ont résulté ont incité les banques centrales à maintenir les taux d’intérêt 
à des niveaux relativement faibles, niveaux qui, avec le recul, ont pu contribuer à une 
croissance excessive du crédit et donc à la création de bulles des prix d’actifs.  
Certains commentateurs ont par conséquent suggéré d’inclure les prix des actifs dans l’indice 
retenu comme objectif par la banque centrale. Je ne pense pas qu’il s’agisse d’une solution 
satisfaisante : en pratique, cela reviendrait à évoluer vers une situation où un seul instrument, 
la politique monétaire, viserait deux objectifs, la stabilité des prix et la stabilité financière. 
Selon la théorie économique, en présence d’objectifs multiples, les autorités doivent faire 
appel à un nombre d’instruments au moins égal au nombre d’objectifs. En revanche, combiner 
des objectifs multiples en un seul ne résoudrait le problème qu’en apparence en réduisant 
artificiellement le nombre d’objectifs, mais cela ne changerait pas la nature fondamentale du 
problème de contrôle auquel sont confrontées les autorités.

The Greenspan Era: Lessons for the Future, sous l’égide de la Banque fédérale de réserve de Kansas City,

Il y a actuellement très peu de recherches en cours sur l’interaction entre les politiques 
monétaire et macro-prudentielle au sein de modèles d’équilibre général rigoureusement 
microfondés. Les experts de la Banque de France et moi-même sommes très admiratifs du 
leadership de la Banque d'Italie dans ce domaine, comme l’atteste l’étude réalisée par 
MM. Angelini, Neri et Panetta12 et présentée au cours de cette conférence. J’attends avec 
impatience d’autres travaux sur cette nouvelle dimension de la politique macroéconomique. Si 
la recherche portant sur de nouveaux thèmes peut se révéler ingrate, les premières études de 
qualité dans ce domaine auront une audience considérable et seront largement citées.  
Je sais que les capacités intellectuelles de cet auditoire sont de tout premier ordre. 
Permettez-moi de vous dire que si jamais vous avez rêvé de jouer un rôle de premier plan 
dans l’élaboration et la mise en œuvre de la politique économique, le moment est idéal. Vos 
contributions sont indispensables !

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Le rôle des banquiers centraux sur les marchés financiers mondiaux d’aujourd’hui 
Fédération internationale des Bourses de valeurs  
Paris 12 octobre 2010 
 
En mai 2009, la BCE a mis en place un programme d’achat d’obligations sécurisées et en 
mai 2010, elle s’est engagée dans une succession d’interventions sur les marchés obligataires tant 
publics que privés, en l’occurrence les marchés de la dette souveraine, en vue de, et je cite, « garantir 
la liquidité et la profondeur des compartiments du marché qui connaissent des dysfonctionnements ». 
 
En fait, depuis 2008, la présence active de la quasi-totalité des banques centrales sur de 
nombreux compartiments du marché pourrait laisser penser que les interventions directes sur le 
marché sont devenues le mode opératoire courant des banques centrales. C’est loin d’être le cas et je 
souhaiterais consacrer mon intervention d’aujourd’hui aux deux idées suivantes : 
<U+F0B7> Les banques centrales ont besoin de marchés efficients pour s’acquitter de leur mandat. 
<U+F0B7> Cette nécessité peut les conduire à procéder à des interventions directes massives sur les marchés, 
mais ces interventions doivent conserver un caractère exceptionnel. 
 
Pour étudier le rôle des banques centrales sur les marchés, nous devons commencer par 
examiner leur mandat, qui recouvre non seulement les missions elles-mêmes, mais également la 
manière dont elles sont accomplies, c’est-à-dire en conformité avec le principe d’indépendance qui les 
régit. 
Cette question n’étant pas l’objet principal de notre débat d’aujourd’hui, je vais simplement 
faire un bref rappel des faits. 
 
<U+F0B7> Le rôle des banques centrales sur les marchés est déterminé par leurs objectifs, dont le principal est 
incontestablement d’assurer la stabilité des prix. Mais ce n’est pas leur seul objectif. Comme nous 
le savons, le Système fédéral de réserve opère dans le cadre d’un mandat « multiple » qui consiste 
à, je cite, « promouvoir efficacement les objectifs de plein emploi, de stabilité des prix et de 
modération des taux d’intérêt à long terme », alors que la plupart des autres banques centrales, et 
en particulier la BCE, ont un « mandat hiérarchisé », qui place l’objectif de stabilité des prix au-
 2
dessus de tous les autres objectifs. Plus précisément, le Traité de Maastricht dispose que « sans 
préjudice de l’objectif de stabilité des prix, le SEBC apporte son soutien aux politiques 
économiques générales dans la Communauté, en vue de contribuer à la réalisation des objectifs de 
la Communauté ». Dans cette perspective, l’un des objectifs de la Communauté que nous devons 
soutenir consiste à « promouvoir la solidarité entre les États membres ».  
 
<U+F0B7> Pour remplir leur mandat, les banques centrales doivent être crédibles et donc indépendantes. Si 
les agents économiques ont le moindre doute ou le moindre soupçon que l’institution pourrait être 
incitée à les surprendre en laissant s’installer une inflation élevée, ils risqueraient d’ajuster leur 
comportement à titre de précaution et de « provoquer » ainsi une hausse de l’inflation en 
augmentant leurs revendications salariales, ce qui déclencherait une spirale prix-salaires ; ou bien 
en exigeant des rendements plus élevés sur leur épargne, ce qui entrainerait une hausse des taux 
d’intérêt à long terme et pèserait sur la croissance. L’indépendance, qui est particulièrement bien 
ancrée parmi les banques centrales de la zone euro, permet d’éviter cet écueil ; comme vous le 
savez, le Traité précise que l’Eurosystème et les membres de ses organes de décision ne peuvent 
pas accepter d’instructions, notamment de la part des gouvernements des États membres. 
 
Dans la pratique, les banques centrales atteignent leurs objectifs en accomplissant des 
missions, notamment en mettant en œuvre la politique monétaire. Pour ce faire, nous utilisons notre 
principal instrument, la fixation du taux directeur, c’est-à-dire le taux d’intérêt à très court terme 
auquel les banques commerciales se refinancent auprès de la banque centrale. Les impulsions de 
politique monétaire sont transmises à l’économie via le canal du taux d’intérêt en liaison avec le canal 
du crédit bancaire qui joue un rôle particulièrement important dans les économies de la zone euro, 
caractérisées par un niveau élevé d’intermédiation. 
 
Nous savons comment fonctionnent traditionnellement ces canaux de transmission : la banque 
centrale fixe le taux d’intérêt sans risque à très court terme, puis les marchés déterminent, pour 
l’ensemble des échéances et des émetteurs, la valeur des actifs, sur la base de leurs anticipations 
concernant l’orientation future de ce taux et de leur évaluation des risques : solvabilité des débiteurs, 
liquidité des actifs et incertitude entourant l’ensemble des paramètres. Les marchés construisent ainsi 
une série de courbes des rendements qui reflètent l’équilibre entre l’offre et la demande de 
financement sur les marchés financiers et de crédit bancaire. 
 
Dans un environnement où la crédibilité de l’objectif de la banque centrale de maintenir 
l’inflation à un bas niveau est bien ancrée, la solvabilité de la plupart des agents est considérée comme 
acquise, les marchés sont bien organisés et donc liquides, les taux d’intérêt restent bas sur l’ensemble 
des échéances et les valorisations demeurent élevées ; les modifications des taux directeurs n’affectent 
pas les anticipations d’inflation, qui restent faibles, et les variations des taux d’intérêt réels permettent 
une transmission efficace à l’économie des décisions de politique monétaire. 
 3
 
En temps normal, les interactions entre les banques centrales et les marchés sont donc 
importantes mais ne traduisent guère d’ingérence : 
 
<U+F0B7> Les banques centrales influencent les marchés en modifiant le niveau des taux d’intérêt à court 
terme ; elles expliquent le raisonnement qui sous-tend leurs décisions de taux afin d’améliorer la 
qualité des anticipations des agents économiques ; elles mettent en œuvre des mécanismes 
techniques destinés à favoriser la liquidité sur certains compartiments clés du marché, en 
établissant par exemple une liste d’actifs admis en garantie de leurs opérations de refinancement 
ou en mettant en place un guichet de l’escompte pour permettre aux banques ayant des besoins de 
liquidité temporaires et inattendus de se refinancer. 
 
<U+F0B7> Si les marchés écoutent les banques centrales, les banques centrales sont également à l’écoute des 
marchés, dans la mesure où la formation des prix sur les marchés reflète les anticipations des 
agents, notamment celles concernant l’inflation, ainsi que leur évaluation des risques ; les 
banques centrales ont besoin de ces informations pour effectuer leurs analyses et prendre leurs 
décisions de politique monétaire.  
 
Le bon fonctionnement des marchés et la stabilité financière sont donc essentiels pour garantir 
l’efficacité de la transmission de la politique monétaire.   
 
<U+F0B7> Si la forme de la courbe des rendements évolue indépendamment des décisions de politique 
monétaire, si les primes de risque sont décorrélées des fondamentaux, si la liquidité de marché 
s’assèche, alors le canal du taux d’intérêt cesse de fonctionner. 
<U+F0B7> Lorsque cela affecte le financement des banques, par le biais notamment d’un gel du marché 
interbancaire, le canal du crédit bancaire se grippe. 
 
Dans ce cas, les banques centrales doivent recourir à des mesures non conventionnelles, telles que des 
interventions directes offensives pour garantir une transmission efficace de leurs décisions de politique 
monétaire et le maintien, à un rythme ralenti, de l’activité sur les marchés.  
 
Il va sans dire que nous avons connu ces derniers temps de multiples incidents de ce type qui 
ont nécessité la mise en œuvre de nombreuses mesures non conventionnelles. Parmi celles 
actuellement en vigueur, certaines sont du ressort de l’« assouplissement quantitatif », c’est-à-dire 
l’achat de titres en vue essentiellement de créer un excédent de liquidité susceptible de se diffuser à 
tous les compartiments de marché et de favoriser un meilleur refinancement de l’économie ; les autres 
relèvent de l’ « assouplissement des conditions de crédit » et visent à restaurer le fonctionnement de 
certains compartiments particulièrement perturbés du marché. Autrement dit, certaines mesures ont 
pour objectif de rétablir le bon fonctionnement du canal du taux d’intérêt en agissant directement sur 
 4
la courbe des rendements, et d’autres visent à restaurer le canal du crédit bancaire en permettant aux 
banques de se refinancer au-delà des échéances à très court terme auxquelles les banques centrales se 
cantonnent en général. Dans tous les cas, les banques centrales se substituent aux intervenants ou aux 
marchés défaillants. 
 
Depuis 2008, nous avons vu le Système fédéral de réserve se porter à la rescousse du marché 
américain du papier commercial et de celui des titres adossés à des prêts hypothécaires ; nous avons vu 
la Banque d’Angleterre faire l’acquisition, en l’espace de quelques mois, de titres d’État à hauteur de 
200 milliards de livres sterling, soit 15 % environ du PIB du Royaume-Uni ; l’Eurosystème a, quant à 
lui, mené de nombreuses opérations de refinancement d’une durée d’un an avec les banques de la zone 
euro et relancé le marché des obligations sécurisées grâce à son programme d’achat de 60 milliards 
d’euros. En mai dernier, il a également commencé à intervenir sur le marché des titres d’État. Ce point 
mérite quelques précisions, à la lumière de mon analyse précédente, car les motivations de cette 
décision illustrent parfaitement l’interaction entre les marchés et les banques centrales. 
 
Quelle était la situation en mai et comment a-t-elle évolué ? 
 
<U+F0B7> La stabilité des prix n’a pas été et n’est toujours pas remise en question dans la zone euro ; après 
une période de recul des prix, largement en raison des évolutions des prix de l’énergie, nous 
retrouvons progressivement une configuration plus compatible avec notre définition de la 
stabilité, c’est-à-dire une hausse des prix inférieure à, mais proche de 2 %. Toutefois, depuis le 
début de l’année, tous les indicateurs ont constamment montré que les risques à la hausse pesant 
sur l’inflation étaient très faibles. La Commission a publié par exemple, début mai, des prévisions 
d’inflation pour la zone euro s’établissant à 1,5 % pour 2010 et à 1,7 % pour 2011. Selon les 
prévisions de la BCE publiées début septembre, l’inflation devrait ressortir à 1,6 % en 2010 et à 
1,7 % en 2011. 
 
<U+F0B7> Les pays de la zone euro ont rapidement pris d’importantes mesures pour ramener leurs finances 
publiques à l’équilibre et, partant, restaurer la compétitivité de leur économie. C’est 
manifestement le cas des pays dont les marchés de la dette ont été les plus affectés au cours des 
derniers mois. 
 
<U+F0B7> Toutefois, en mai, les marchés financiers ont recommencé à se gripper, de manière certes 
légèrement différente de ce qui avait été observé en 2008, mais avec les mêmes conséquences 
potentiellement désastreuses, à savoir un tarissement du financement de l’économie. En 2008, le 
système financier a été forte durement frappé par la crise des subprime et par la faillite de 
Lehman Brothers qui a donné un coup d’arrêt aux transactions, les intervenants de marché s’étant 
rendus compte que toute banque, si grande soit elle, pouvait faire défaut en particulier parce que 
le montant exact de l’exposition aux subprime de l’ensemble des institutions n’était pas 
 5
parfaitement connu. Dans l’épisode de mai 2010, la dynamique à l’œuvre a été la même. Les 
différents investisseurs ont commencé à penser que les pays de la zone euro pouvaient faire 
défaut sur leur dette et ont donc arrêté de consentir des prêts à ces pays ou à leurs banques, ou à 
toute banque susceptible de présenter une exposition à ces pays, et pour finir, à titre de 
précaution, ils ont cessé toute activité de prêt. 
 
Cette situation a nécessité une intervention rapide et décisive de la BCE pour les raisons suivantes : 
<U+F0B7> Nous ne pouvons pas mettre en œuvre la politique monétaire sur des marchés perturbés qui ne 
répartissent pas efficacement la liquidité que nous injectons ou qui modifient radicalement les 
effets de notre politique monétaire en offrant des taux d’intérêt incompatibles avec nos taux 
directeurs. 
 
Nous avons donc pris une série de mesures visant à rétablir immédiatement la 
situation en traitant tous les problèmes relevant de notre domaine de compétences et, en particulier, 
nous avons décidé d’intervenir sur les marchés de titres dont le fonctionnement anormal 
compromettait la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire et la stabilité financière. Dans le cas présent, 
nous avons ciblé les marchés de la dette souveraine, qui déterminent les conditions de financement des 
autres émetteurs du pays considéré. Quand les marchés de la dette souveraine cessent de fonctionner, 
ce sont les besoins de financement de l’ensemble du pays qui ne peuvent être satisfaits. 
 
Il ne s’agit pas d’une opération d’assouplissement quantitatif, aucun montant n’étant défini à 
l’avance et l’intégralité de la liquidité fournie par le biais des achats de titres étant stérilisée sur le 
marché interbancaire via les dépôts à terme offerts aux banques. Il ne s’agit pas non plus d’une 
opération d’assouplissement du crédit visant une catégorie d’agent en particulier : les titres d’État ne 
sont pas achetés sur le marché primaire et ces titres peuvent être émis par des emprunteurs comme la 
Grèce, qui a pratiquement cessé d’émettre de la dette en raison du mécanisme mis en place pour 
assurer son financement par les pays de la zone euro et le FMI. Cette mesure visait simplement à 
restaurer les canaux de transmission de la politique monétaire par l’intermédiaire des marchés de la 
dette. 
 
Selon moi, les récents épisodes mettent clairement en lumière ce que les marchés peuvent 
attendre des banques centrales, c’est-à-dire des actions résolues destinées à dégonfler les bulles 
positives et négatives de prix d’actifs dès lors qu’elles interfèrent avec les canaux de transmission de la 
politique monétaire. Chaque situation nécessite une réponse appropriée, laquelle, nous le savons 
désormais, inclut des interventions massives et directes sur les marchés, dans une certaine mesure 
analogues à des interventions de change. Il est évident que ce type d’action ne connait pas de 
contrainte de montant ou de durée ; les montants sont illimités parce que les banques centrales peuvent 
absorber la liquidité injectée et que, par essence, elles n’ont pas de problèmes de liquidité dans leur 
 6
monnaie. De plus, à mon sens, le fait que les banques centrales ont montré qu’elles étaient capables de 
prendre ces mesures peut, en soi, freiner l’émergence de perturbations des prix d’actifs en limitant la 
spéculation. De récents achats d’ampleur modeste effectués dans le cadre de notre Programme 
s’adressant aux marchés de titres nous ont permis de rappeler avec acuité que nous continuons de 
suivre très attentivement l’évolution des principaux marchés. 
 
Cela ne signifie pas, néanmoins, que les marchés et les intervenants de marché devront 
toujours s’attendre à de telles interventions de la part des banques centrales. À l’instar de la fonction 
de prêteur en dernier ressort, le rôle d’acheteur en dernier ressort que peuvent jouer les banques 
centrales ne doit pas concerner les émetteurs insolvables et ne doit pas, sous peine de créer un aléa 
moral très dangereux, présenter un caractère systématique chaque fois qu’un problème survient. Ces 
interventions doivent déboucher dans les meilleurs délais sur un retour à un fonctionnement normal 
des marchés, qui constitue le seul moyen d’assurer une répartition vraiment efficace des capitaux et 
qui nous permet de déterminer les anticipations des agents économiques. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours introductif aux 12èmes journées du Livre d’Économie 
Intervention de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
« En quoi la crise conduit-elle à reconsidérer la science économique ? »  
 
Personne n'avait prévu la crise. Personne n'avait même imaginé qu'elle puisse se 
produire sous cette forme et avec une telle ampleur. On peut donc douter aujourd'hui 
de la capacité de la science économique à expliquer la réalité et  de son aptitude à 
nous aider à  comprendre le monde. Et, comme l'économie moderne repose assez 
largement sur les mécanismes de marché, la crise peut aussi ébranler, chez 
beaucoup de nos concitoyens, la confiance dans l'économie de  marché.  
 
Face à ces interrogations et ces doutes, je vais essayer aujourd'hui de présenter 
quelques réflexions personnelles, sans dissimuler les questions qui se posent et les 
incertitudes auxquelles nous devons faire face. 
 
Dans le débat scientifique et la discussion publique, il faut bien distinguer trois 
questions: (1) L'économie de marché est-elle efficace ? (2) Est-elle stable ? (3) Est-
elle juste ? Je laisse de coté la question de la justice. Non parce qu'elle est 
secondaire : au contraire, elle est trop importante pour être traitée aussi rapidement. 
Je me contenterai de la question de l’efficacité et de la stabilité qui ont un caractère 
plus macroéconomique.  
 
D'abord quelques définitions. L'efficacité d'une économie se mesure à sa capacité à 
bien allouer les ressources, à identifier  en permanence les besoins des agents 
économiques et les satisfaire au moindre coût. La stabilité est un concept différent. 
Une économie est stable si elle revient à l'équilibre après ce que les économistes 
2 
 
appellent un choc. Par choc, ils entendent en fait des circonstances largement 
imprévues telles qu’une forte augmentation du prix du pétrole. L’économie est 
instable si elle comporte des mécanismes qui amplifient les chocs, voire qui en 
créent eux-mêmes au sein du système économique.  
 
La prospérité d'une économie dépend d'abord de son efficacité. Faire les bons 
investissements et les bons choix technologiques, savoir optimiser l'organisation de 
la production, éviter les gaspillages, tout ceci crée l’emploi et favorise la croissance.  
Mais la stabilité compte aussi : des chocs trop fréquents et trop violents créent de 
l'incertitude, ils ont parfois des effets irréversibles et réduisent la consommation et les 
capacités de production. La crise actuelle en est l'illustration, qui se traduit par une 
perte considérable de ressources, une montée du chômage et un déclassement de 
nombreux investissements. 
 
Les marchés sont généralement considérés comme l'instrument le plus efficace 
d'une bonne allocation des ressources. Bien sûr, ils comportent des défaillances que 
l'action publique doit corriger. Mais, hormis la Corée du Nord et Cuba -deux pays 
enfoncés dans l'extrême pauvreté- il n'existe plus, aujourd'hui, dans le monde, 
d'économie dirigée. Partout, le marché joue un rôle essentiel pour fixer les prix et 
guider les décisions des entreprises et des ménages. Globalement, tous le monde 
s'accorde donc à considérer que les économies de marché sont efficaces.  
 
Sont-elles aussi naturellement stables ? La crise a prouvé l'inverse. Elle nous a 
montré que les économies de marché sont instables, peut-être même 
fondamentalement instables. En un sens, nous le savions déjà. Après tout, il ya eu, 
depuis trente ans, période de grande libéralisation financière,  d'autres crises, sans 
doute moins graves, mais assez fréquentes. Nous l'avions oublié. Nous avons 
traversé depuis presque deux décennies une phase de croissance exceptionnelle  
dans sa régularité, ceci en l’absence d’inflation. Cette phase, qui a été qualifiée de 
""grande modération"" nous a peut-être anesthésiés. Nous avons cru avoir trouvé les 
recettes de politique économique nous garantissant la stabilité pour toujours. 
 
La science économique aurait du nous détromper. Elle nous a au contraire confortés 
dans nos illusions. Que s'est-il passé ? 
3 
 
 
Depuis trois décennies, l'analyse économique s'est développée sur un corps 
d'hypothèses et de principes fondés sur la rationalité absolue des agents 
économiques et l'efficience totale des marchés financiers. Avec ces hypothèses,  
efficacité et stabilité coïncident naturellement.  
 
En particulier, il n'y a pas d'instabilité financière. L'activité spéculative est elle-même 
stabilisante car les spéculateurs ont intérêt à acheter quand les prix sont trop bas et 
à vendre quand ils sont trop hauts. Ils ramènent donc  les prix et les marchés vers 
leurs niveaux d'équilibre fondamental. Pour cette raison, sur un marché efficient, il n'y 
a pas de bulles financières. Le crédit est correctement attribué parce que  la 
solvabilité de chaque agent économique peut être précisément évaluée. Tous les 
emprunteurs solvables trouvent des financements. La liquidité est toujours présente 
en quantité suffisante. 
 
De même, dans un tel environnement, il n'y a pas de volatilité économique. Les 
ménages et entreprises font en permanence des choix rationnels de consommation, 
d'épargne et d'investissement.  Il n'y a pas de place, dans cette approche, pour les 
cycles économiques. Bien sur on constate que ces cycles existent, avec des phases 
d'expansion et de moindre croissance, voire de récession. Pour partie, on considère 
que ces cycles proviennent de ""chocs"", par exemple une découverte technologique 
qui accélère temporairement la croissance et l'investissement ; pour partie, ils 
résultent de ""frictions"", c'est-à dire des imperfections des marchés eux-mêmes, par 
exemple la rigidité des prix et des salaires, qui fait qu'ils ne s'adaptent que 
progressivement aux déséquilibres entre offre et demande. Mais l'hypothèse 
fondamentale est que, laissée à elle-même, une économie de marché ne connaît pas 
la crise. Même frappée par des chocs, elle revient à l'équilibre, après un délai plus ou 
moins long.  
 
Comment cette vision s'est-elle progressivement imposée ?  
 
Au cours des trente dernières années, l'analyse macro économique et celle des 
marchés financiers ont  beaucoup gagné en rigueur intellectuelle et en cohérence 
formelle. Elles se sont développées sur des représentations très rigoureuses  - et 
4 
 
une modélisation poussée - du comportement des agents économiques et du 
fonctionnement des marchés. Cette modélisation a été critiquée pour son formalisme 
et son recours excessif à des outils mathématiques très sophistiqués. Je ne partage 
pas cette critique. Je crois profondément que la modélisation est une aide 
indispensable à l'analyse et à la décision de politique économique.  
 
Mon interrogation est ailleurs. Il est clair que, quelle que soit leur puissance, les 
techniques de modélisation disponibles ne permettent pas de donner une 
représentation  fidèle et complète d'une réalité économique complexe.  Il existe donc 
un choix, un arbitrage, entre rigueur formelle et réalisme. L'analyse économique a fait 
le choix de la rigueur totale. Mais ce choix s'est accompagné d'une simplification 
extrême dans la description des comportements individuels et du fonctionnement des 
marchés. L'économiste moderne raisonne sur ce qu'on appelle des ""agents 
représentatifs"" (ménages, entreprises,) tous identiques, qui forment des anticipations 
""rationnelles"",  et pour lesquels existent des marches financiers ""complets"". Si l'on 
accepte ces hypothèses, toute l'évolution de l'économie et des marchés financiers 
peut alors être décrite en supposant que ces agents représentatifs optimisent à tout 
moment leur choix de consommation, d’investissement et d’épargne sans contrainte 
de liquidité. Il n'est même pas besoin de tenir compte des marchés financiers 
puisque leur efficience garantit que le capital est bien alloué dans l'économie. Et, de 
fait, les modèles macroéconomiques contemporains font très largement l'impasse sur 
les variables financières, le fonctionnement des marchés de capitaux ainsi que sur le 
rôle et l'évolution du crédit. Ce parti pris a, bien sur  joué un grand rôle dans leur 
incapacité à décrire la crise, ou même à envisager son éventualité. 
 
L'expérience a montré ce qu'il en était. Nous avons vu se développer au cours des 
deux années de crise, des enchainements cumulatifs, des comportements 
mimétiques, des assèchements de liquidité, une paralysie totale de certains 
marchés, une grande incertitude sur les valorisations, une opacité des structures et 
des produits, tous phénomènes qui contredisent absolument l'hypothèse d'efficience. 
Du jour au lendemain, des banques qui se prêtaient au jour le jour leurs excédents 
de trésorerie sur le marché interbancaire depuis des décennies ont décidé d’arrêter 
de le faire.  Nous savons aussi que la crise a suivi une période d'euphorie artificielle, 
conduisant à une bulle immobilière dans plusieurs pays et un développement 
5 
 
excessif du crédit masqué par une innovation financière souvent factice. Rien dans la 
théorie du marché efficient n'éclaire cette réalité. Nous possédions, bien sûr, des 
références souvent brillantes, illustrant les défaillances des marchés (tels les 
modèles de panique bancaire) ou la fragilité des systèmes financiers. Mais elles n'ont 
jamais conduit à une remise en cause fondamentale de l'hypothèse d'efficience. 
 
La science économique est donc confrontée à un examen de conscience et à un 
redoutable défi. Il lui faut d'une part, viser à décrire le monde tel qu'il est, avec toute 
sa complexité et son corolaire, l'incertitude et la diversité (et donc, sans doute 
renoncer à la simplification de l'agent représentatif). Il faut penser l'économie et, 
notamment, la sphère financière comme un système complexe, ce qui permettra de 
mieux rendre compte  de la volatilité, des évolutions brutales et des discontinuités qui 
apparaissent périodiquement sous forme de crises plus ou moins aigues. Mais la 
science doit aussi conserver une rigueur analytique conceptuelle, faute de quoi 
l'analyse économique se résumerait  à une collection de descriptions empiriques aux 
fondements incertains et, donc  difficilement exploitable pour guider les politiques 
économiques. Dans la description de la complexité,  concilier rigueur et réalisme sera 
un défi majeur. Pour être franc, tout le monde ignore aujourd'hui comment ce 
dilemme et cette tension seront résolus. Il faudra probablement de longues années.  
 
Mon intuition est que notre approche théorique de la finance sera profondément 
bouleversée. Il faudra prendre en compte les incitations, l'incertitude, les effets de 
l'innovation et ses liens avec le risque de système, c'est-à-dire l’interdépendance 
entre les décisions individuelles et leurs effets indésirables pour l’ensemble des 
acteurs de marché. Quand à l'analyse macroéconomique elle-même, nous 
assisterons probablement au développement de deux démarches opposées : l'une 
fondée sur l'approfondissement des hypothèses et méthodes actuelles, en espérant 
que la sophistication croissante  des modèles les rapprochera de la réalité ; l'autre, 
plus empirique,  proche d'autres disciplines telles que la psychologie et les sciences 
du comportement.   
 
Malgré cette incertitude, nous devons continuer à conduire les politiques 
économiques en tirant, si possible, les leçons de la crise. Je voudrais faire ici trois 
remarques. 
6 
 
 
Nous savons maintenant que l'économie de marché est instable. Nous devons donc 
en tirer durablement  les conséquences. L'une, qui s'impose, est qu'il faut renforcer 
notre capacité à faire face à l'instabilité, puisqu'elle fait partie de notre univers 
économique.  Il faut des économies plus robustes. En simplifiant, il faut installer, 
partout où nous le pouvons, des ""coussins"" pour absorber les chocs. Cette idée 
simple a des implications multiples. Des ""coussins"" budgétaires doivent  permettre de  
soutenir l'activité en cas de crise sans, comme c'est le cas aujourd'hui pour tous les 
pays avancés conduire à des niveaux insoutenables de dettes. Il est donc prioritaire 
de consolider nos finances publiques et  de regagner des marges de manœuvres. 
Dans un autre domaine, nous allons constituer  des  ""coussins""  dans le système 
financier en augmentant les exigences en capital des banques.  
 
Ceci conduit à ma deuxième remarque. L'impression prévaut que la crise a conduit à 
réhabiliter durablement l'activisme des États dans la politique économique. Ce n'est 
pas toujours vrai.  
 
Nous avons certes durablement changé notre approche de la régulation financière. 
Implicitement, dans de nombreux pays, la référence était celle du marché efficient. 
La régulation, quand elle existait, devait donc simplement viser à éliminer les 
obstacles à l'efficience et se rapprocher le plus possible du modèle idéal. Et donc 
surtout, ne pas interférer avec le marché. C'était une réglementation par ""touche 
légère"". Aujourd'hui, l'approche est inverse. On postule la non efficience, et on en tire 
les conséquences: renforcement de la robustesse, changement des incitations (par 
exemple par des règles sur les rémunérations), supervision des acteurs non 
bancaires. 
 
L'évolution est moins claire sur la politique dite macroéconomique. La crise a conduit 
à un activisme budgétaire certes justifié, mais qui ne peut être renouvelé compte 
tenu du poids des dettes publiques dont, conformément aux hypothèses, nos 
concitoyens anticipent ""rationnellement"" qu'elles risquent de devenir insoutenables. 
 
Ma troisième remarque en découle. Dans la remise en cause de la science 
économique, il faut prendre garde à ne pas, si j'ose dire, jeter le bébé avec l'eau du 
7 
 
bain et nous priver des avancées considérables réalisées depuis trente ans. Je 
prendrais un exemple important: l'hypothèse dite des anticipations rationnelles.  
Poussée à l'extrême, elle est probablement irréaliste. Il est excessif  de penser que 
tous les agents économiques peuvent fonder leurs décisions sur de telles 
anticipations. Mais l'intuition fondamentale reste juste. Les anticipations jouent un 
grand rôle dans la vie économique: les agents  se tournent vers l'avenir pour prendre 
leurs décisions. Ils  ne se trompent pas toujours et systématiquement.  
 
Toute la politique monétaire contemporaine est construite sur ce constat. Nous 
savons, depuis trente ans, que l'inflation est déterminée par les anticipations  et que, 
pour atteindre la stabilité des prix, il faut pouvoir influencer et stabiliser (nous disons, 
dans notre jargon  ""ancrer"") ces anticipations. Pour cela tous les pays ont construit 
des cadres institutionnels, fondés sur l'indépendance des Banques Centrales qui 
mettent la politique monétaire à l'abri des contraintes et pressions du court terme.  
L'expérience est très réussie et, dans tous les grands pays, l'inflation parait 
désormais vaincue. Vous êtes, pour nombre d’entre vous, trop jeunes pour l’avoir 
vécu vous-même, mais vos parents et grands-parents ont connu, dans les années 
1970, des périodes où l’inflation évoluait de 5 à 15% par an. 
 
La crise a certes montré que la stabilité des prix n'était pas une condition suffisante 
de la stabilité financière. Mais elle en est certainement une condition nécessaire. 
Vous me permettrez de conclure ces brèves réflexions par ce modeste plaidoyer en 
faveur des Banques Centrales, dont l'indépendance ne les pas empêchées, comme 
vous le savez, de se mobiliser très activement pour combattre la crise et tenter d'en 
limiter les effets.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Paris-Europlace Financial Forum 
29 Novembre 29, Tokyo, 
 
« La stabilité financière internationale» 
 
Bien que la crise financière soit née dans un pays, il est vite apparu qu’elle était de nature 
indéniablement mondiale. Elle a délivré un message simple : les marchés de capitaux sont 
étroitement interconnectés à travers le monde et, par conséquent, la stabilité financière 
intérieure est indissociable de la stabilité financière internationale. Il s’agit réellement des 
deux faces d’une même médaille.  
 
J’aimerais aujourd’hui mener une réflexion sur la stabilité financière internationale. Les 
points de vue exprimés ici sont les miens. Cependant, comme vous le savez, la France est 
actuellement en charge de la présidence du G20 et je m’efforcerai de replacer mes propres 
réflexions dans cette perspective. 
 
L’instabilité financière internationale s’est accentuée ces derniers temps. Qu’il s’agisse des 
taux de change, des flux internationaux de capitaux ou des cours des matières premières, les 
signes d’une plus grande volatilité abondent.  
 
La volatilité n’est pas nécessairement une mauvaise chose. Dans une certaine mesure, elle 
témoigne du bon fonctionnement des marchés. Les mouvements de prix d’actifs permettent au 
système financier d’agir comme un volant de sécurité, pour « absorber » les chocs 
économiques exogènes. Ce processus accroît le bien-être, dans la mesure où cela évite, ou du 
moins limite, l’ajustement des marchés, plus rigides, des biens et du travail.  
 
La volatilité peut résulter également de l’évolution des fondamentaux. Par exemple, les flux 
de capitaux vers les économies émergentes reflètent en partie des perspectives de croissance à 
long terme très favorables et une rentabilité potentiellement forte des capitaux. Cela n’a rien 
d’anormal. Il peut tout au plus paraître paradoxal que les flux nets de capitaux soient encore 
dirigés vers l’amont, des économies émergentes vers les économies développées. Cela signifie 
que certains citoyens comptant parmi les plus pauvres du monde prêtent de l’argent aux plus 
riches, leur permettant de financer leur consommation. 
 
Il en va de même pour les cours des matières premières. Le fonctionnement des marchés de 
matières premières est de plus en plus comparable à celui des marchés d’actifs, compte tenu 
 
2/4 
du développement d’instruments financiers reposant sur des paniers de matières premières. En 
fait, les matières premières sont devenues une classe d’actifs à proprement parler, qui réclame 
une attention particulière du point de vue de la stabilité financière. Par ailleurs, il peut y avoir 
de bonnes raisons de penser que les « fondamentaux », comme une croissance robuste dans 
les pays à forte intensité de consommation de matières premières, entretiennent le 
comportement actuel de nombreux marchés de matières premières.  
 
Enfin, la volatilité financière résulte probablement de plusieurs spécificités de 
l’environnement actuel. La concomitance de l’incertitude économique, d’une forte aversion 
au risque et d’une liquidité abondante à l’échelle mondiale est particulièrement propice à un 
retournement brutal du sentiment des marchés et à des réaménagements soudains des 
portefeuilles.   
 
La volatilité commence à faire problème lorsqu’elle résulte des décisions des autorités et que 
les marchés financiers contribuent à aggraver les chocs au lieu de les atténuer. Une instabilité 
durable s’installe alors et génère des menaces potentielles pour l’économie réelle. Il se peut 
que nous nous trouvions aujourd’hui dans une telle situation, la cohérence réciproque des 
stratégies économiques suivies par les principales économies étant mise en doute. Dans le 
même temps, les politiques mises en œuvre pour traiter la volatilité peuvent parfois provoquer 
des dommages et des distorsions supplémentaires sur les marchés de capitaux. Je traiterai ces 
deux questions avant de m’intéresser rapidement aux défis à plus long terme. 
 
Déséquilibres mondiaux et stabilité financière 
 
Il existe un large consensus sur la nécessité de rééquilibrer la demande globale à travers le 
monde. Cet objectif partagé a renforcé la cohésion affichée par les pays du G20 pendant la 
phase aiguë de la crise. Il a joué un rôle essentiel en 2008 et en 2009 pour rétablir la confiance 
et tracer le chemin de la reprise. Cependant, cette approche concertée des déséquilibres 
mondiaux pourrait avoir perdu de sa force récemment. Il y a un véritable débat autour de deux 
questions majeures et étroitement liées : premièrement, sur le rythme approprié du 
rééquilibrage, les pays avancés lui accordant un plus grand degré d’urgence ; et, 
deuxièmement, sur les stratégies les plus efficaces, notamment en matière de taux de change.  
 
Ce serait une erreur d’attribuer la responsabilité des déséquilibres à une cause spécifique. 
Tous les pays ont des préoccupations légitimes. Nous avons observé ces dernières semaines 
une propension de certains pays à contester les politiques monétaire de leurs partenaires. On 
ne peut rien attendre de bon d’une telle attitude.   
 
Nous devons nous appuyer sur trois réalités de fond. 
 
Premièrement, les pays sont libres de mener les politiques monétaires qu’ils estiment 
appropriées. En effet, lorsque les banques centrales sont indépendantes, elles sont 
juridiquement tenues d’agir de la sorte. La politique monétaire doit être menée uniquement en 
fonction d’objectifs domestiques mais, comme vous l’avez constaté, toutes les banques 
centrales ont le même mandat : la stabilité des prix. Cela vaut pour tous les pays, petits ou 
grands. Le monde a tiré un énorme bénéfice de deux décennies de stabilité des prix résultant 
de régimes monétaires fondés sur l’indépendance de la banque centrale et sur la primauté 
accordée à la stabilité interne des prix. Lorsqu’on a permis à des objectifs externes 
d’influencer les décisions monétaires, cela a généralement donné de très mauvais résultats et 
accru l’instabilité. 
 
 
3/4 
Deuxièmement, en vertu des statuts du FMI, les pays sont libres de choisir leurs régimes de 
compte de capital et de change à condition qu’ils ne pratiquent pas la manipulation des taux 
de change. Il s’agit d’un pilier fondamental de notre système actuel. Cette condition s’est 
révélée très complexe à définir, et plus encore à mettre en œuvre. Le FMI a rencontré des 
difficultés en s’efforçant d’instaurer un processus efficace et symétrique de surveillance 
multilatérale. 
 
Troisièmement, enfin, nous vivons dans un monde caractérisé par une interdépendance et une 
complexité accrues. Les flux internationaux de capitaux ont créé une véritable interconnexion 
entre les pays. Le système monétaire et financier est devenu « multipolaire ». Un nombre 
croissant de pays, tant développés qu’émergents, sont devenus des intervenants actifs sur les 
marchés de capitaux internationaux. Des effets de contagion se sont multipliés entre les 
politiques monétaires et économiques nationales. Et aucun pays ne peut être vraiment 
indifférent aux actions entreprises par les autres.  
Dans les circonstances actuelles, il est devenu beaucoup plus difficile de concilier ces trois 
réalités de fond. 
 
Les divergences des politiques monétaires sont inévitables étant donné le rythme irrégulier de 
la reprise à travers le monde. D’ailleurs, pour chaque pays, il se peut qu’actuellement les 
objectifs de stabilité des prix ne coïncident pas avec les objectifs de stabilité financière. Dans 
les économies avancées, l’assouplissement monétaire et les freins à la croissance du crédit 
créent le risque de nouveaux déséquilibres financiers. Dans de nombreux pays émergents, les 
tensions inflationnistes exigeraient un durcissement monétaire, mais cela risquerait à 
l’évidence de déclencher des entrées de capitaux déstabilisantes.  
 
Dans ce contexte, les politiques macroprudentielles ont un rôle essentiel à jouer. S’agissant 
des économies avancées, elles doivent viser à encourager la croissance du crédit, tout en 
augmentant la résilience du secteur financier. Les autorités de surveillance doivent également 
se tenir prêtes à agir en cas d’apparition sur certains marchés de phénomènes s’apparentant à 
des bulles. En ce qui concerne les économies émergentes, des mesures visant à stabiliser les 
entrées de capitaux peuvent soulager les tensions pesant sur les conditions financières internes 
et prévenir la formation de nouvelles bulles d'actifs.  
 
L’architecture financière internationale  
 
À plus long terme, toutefois, nous devrons sans doute travailler ensemble à l’élaboration 
d’une architecture financière internationale plus efficace et plus stable. Je souhaiterais exposer 
trois pistes de progrès possibles.  
 
Tout d’abord, nous pouvons commencer à réfléchir aux moyens de traiter la volatilité des flux 
internationaux de capitaux. Au niveau d’un pays donné, le contrôle des mouvements de 
capitaux peut temporairement réduire les tensions sur son compte de capital ou même limiter 
de façon permanente la volatilité de son taux de change. S’agissant du système international 
dans son ensemble, toutefois, ces contrôles peuvent simplement reporter les tensions sur 
d’autres pays ou d’autres classes d’actifs et exacerber la volatilité globale au lieu de la 
réduire. Il doit y avoir des moyens d’éliminer ces effets négatifs en créant un cadre prévisible 
définissant les circonstances, les modalités et les conditions de mise en œuvre de contrôles 
temporaires.  
 
 
 
4/4 
Ensuite, il serait judicieux de trouver des moyens de déconnecter l’accumulation de réserves 
de change de la gestion du taux de change et, plus généralement, de la balance des paiements 
et des politiques monétaires. Actuellement, l’accumulation de réserves ne peut s’effectuer que 
par la combinaison d’un excédent de la balance des paiements et d’un certain niveau 
d’interventions de change. Les réserves de change des pays émergents sont passées de 4 % du 
PIB en 1990 à plus de 20 % en moyenne aujourd’hui. L’accumulation de réserves de 
précaution, aussi légitime soit-elle, a inévitablement des effets secondaires sur les politiques 
macroéconomiques internes et des retombées sur d'autres pays. La stabilisation de la demande 
de réserves internationales apporterait par conséquent d’énormes avantages en termes de bien-
être mondial. Le besoin de réserves nationales pourrait être réduit s’il existait des mécanismes 
crédibles permettant d’assurer l’offre de liquidité officielle sur une base multilatérale, d’où la 
recherche actuelle de filets de sécurité financière mondiale qui a pris une place prépondérante 
au sein du G20. 
 
Enfin, j’aimerais dire quelques mots sur le développement financier. Les différences entre 
pays sont frappantes, qu’il s’agisse des régimes de compte de capital, de l’importance et de 
l’endettement des marchés financiers nationaux ou, plus généralement, de leur capacité à 
créer localement une offre suffisante d’actifs sûrs et liquides. Certaines de ces différences 
reflètent de véritables choix et préférences de modèle social qu’il convient de respecter et de 
prendre en compte. D’autres résultent de distorsions induites par les autorités, de façon 
délibérée ou involontaire, qui doivent être réduites ou éliminées. 
 
Les imperfections financières domestiques et les frictions sur les flux de capitaux 
internationaux interagissent pour créer et amplifier les déséquilibres. L’instabilité financière, 
en définitive, est un produit de cette interaction. Une partie de cette instabilité se manifeste 
dans les mouvements de taux de change. Il est très improbable qu’un marché financier 
mondial caractérisé par des frictions constantes entre des systèmes financiers nationaux 
extrêmement différents conduise à un équilibre stable (et reposant sur les fondamentaux) des 
marchés de change. 
 
L’harmonisation complète et la convergence totale du développement financier ne sont ni 
souhaitables ni réalisables. Mais nous devons absolument nous assurer que nos différents 
systèmes financiers interagissent de façon harmonieuse. Une plus grande compatibilité des 
approches de la régulation financière entre les économies avancées et émergentes est à notre 
portée. Des avancées importantes sont en cours. Le cadre institutionnel s’est ajusté à la 
nouvelle réalité du monde. Les pays émergents assument désormais pleinement leur rôle dans 
la constellation des comités qui, à Bâle, travaillent à la définition des principes fondamentaux 
de la régulation financière. Les plus importants d’entre eux siègent en qualité de membres à 
part entière du Conseil de stabilité financière et de son comité de pilotage. Enfin, un accord 
historique sur la réforme du FMI, intervenu lors de la dernière réunion du G20, a pleinement 
reconnu le rôle et la place de ces pays dans le nouvel environnement financier. Je suis donc 
convaincu que nous pouvons progresser dans le traitement des difficiles questions auxquelles 
nous sommes confrontés et construire un système financier mondial meilleur et plus sûr, et 
que nous y parviendrons.

Discours de  Christian Noyer,  Gouverneur de la Banque de France   
Journée des professionnels de la dette et du change  
19 janvier 2011 
 
 
 
Mesdames et messieurs, 
 
 
Je suis très heureux d’ouvrir cette journée des professionnels de la dette et du change. C’est une 
nouvelle illustration du dialogue riche et constructif que nous avons su approfondir tous ensemble au 
cours des dernières années. Ce dialogue s’est avéré essentiel pour nous aider à franchir de nombreuses 
étapes délicates. Il est aujourd’hui devenu  indispensable à notre réflexion sur la politique monétaire 
ainsi que sur les évolutions réglementaires. 
  
La thématique de votre journée, « Les nouveaux défis de l’après crise », est très opportune et je 
voudrais l’aborder en développant trois points qui me paraissent décisifs pour notre avenir proche :  
- D’abord, la nécessité pour la politique monétaire de tirer durablement les enseignements de la 
crise 
- Ensuite, le défi d’une réglementation bancaire adaptée et d’un meilleur encadrement de 
certains marchés 
- Enfin, l’exigence accrue d’une coopération internationale approfondie, en particulier dans 
cette année de présidence française du G20  
 
I. La nécessité pour la politique monétaire de tirer durablement les enseignements de la crise 
 
A. La politique monétaire doit être réactive et son cadre opérationnel flexible. 
 
Tout d’abord, je crois que l’Eurosystème peut être légitimement fier de son « framework » qui a fait la 
preuve de ses qualités pendant la crise : en nous garantissant une grande capacité d’adaptation, il nous 
a donné les moyens d’agir rapidement et efficacement par exemple en mettant en place une nouvelle 
politique d’adjudication et un allongement des maturités des refinancements jusqu’à un an. Cette 
attention portée au financement de plus long terme s’est également traduite par la mise en œuvre du 
programme d’achats de titres sécurisés en faveur de l’immobilier ou des collectivités locales ou 
‘covered bonds’ entre juillet 2009 et juin 2010, pour 60 milliards EUR. Il est indéniable que ce 
programme a donné une impulsion forte au marché des ‘covered bonds’ et a facilité le retour des 
investisseurs.  
L’Eurosystème a par ailleurs fait preuve de pragmatisme en matière d’éligibilité du collatéral aux 
opérations de politique monétaire. En ce domaine, il est important de souligner que nous veillons à 
prendre en compte la réalité des risques et non leur apparence, en utilisant une gamme de critères 
d’appréciation aussi large et précise que le permet le respect de l’égalité de traitement.  
La crise a donc démontré la nécessité d’une politique monétaire réactive.  
2 
 
Elle a aussi renforcé l’exigence pour la politique monétaire d’être attentive aux incitations qu’elle 
envoie au système financier et je voudrais vous dire quelques mots à ce sujet qui est crucial à mon 
sens. 
De façon générale, la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire peut et je dirais même doit susciter ou 
encourager des comportements vertueux. Par exemple, en refusant le collatéral sous forme d’ABS à 
ceux qui sont constitués de multiples couches opaques, l’Eurosystème promeut une titrisation saine, 
utile à long terme pour le développement économique. Nous souhaitons en effet la mise en place par le 
marché d’un portail rassemblant les données clés sur chacun des prêts sous jacents aux ABS, 
accessibles directement à l’ensemble des participants de marché et permettant à chacun de conduire 
une analyse fine des risques attachés à ces produits. Notre ferme volonté est ici de rétablir la confiance 
dans ce marché important  pour le financement  notamment des PME et des ménages.  
 
B. La coopération entre banques centrales est essentielle 
 
Une autre leçon qui doit être tirée de la crise en matière de politique monétaire est l’importance de la 
coopération entre banques centrales. Les différents accords de swaps de change en sont un exemple : 
après ceux conclus avec la FED et la banque nationale suisse en 2008, la BCE et la Banque 
d’Angleterre ont tout récemment annoncé la mise en place d’un accord permettant de mobiliser 
jusqu’à 10 milliards de livres contre euros pour mettre à la disposition de la Banque centrale d’Irlande 
les livres dont elle aurait besoin. L’imbrication des marchés et le recours croissant des établissements 
de crédit aux financements en devises tierces font de cette coopération entre banques centrales une 
dimension incontournable de notre cadre de politique monétaire.  
 
II. Le défi d’une réglementation bancaire adaptée et d’un meilleur encadrement de certains 
marchés 
 
J’en viens à mon deuxième point : le défi d’une réglementation bancaire adaptée et d’un meilleur 
encadrement de certains marchés. 
La Banque de France est très engagée au niveau international afin d’élaborer les réglementations et les 
outils pour prévenir au mieux de nouvelles crises. Les réformes auxquelles nous participons 
actuellement s’organisent autour de deux axes principaux. D’une part, le renforcement de la robustesse 
du système bancaire par les nouvelles normes Bâle 3 et d’autre part la réduction du risque systémique 
sur les activités de marché par la mise en place d’infrastructures adéquates.  
 
A. Une réglementation bancaire adaptée 
 
S’agissant de la réglementation bancaire, les mesures récemment adoptées par le Comité de Bâle 
couvrent de nombreux aspects dont la mise en œuvre d’une définition harmonisée et plus restrictive 
des fonds propres réglementaires, le relèvement du niveau minimal du ratio de solvabilité, ou encore 
l’instauration de ratios de liquidité. 
 
Je souhaite développer un peu ce dernier aspect qui intéresse directement les professionnels que vous 
êtes. La crise nous a montré à quel point la maîtrise de la liquidité était cruciale et difficile à assurer en 
période troublée. La transformation est cependant à la base du métier de banquier ; elle doit être 
préservée mais encadrée par une réglementation sérieuse et homogène. Le Comité de Bâle, dans un 
exercice nouveau à l’échelon international, est parvenu rapidement à un dispositif avec deux nouveaux 
ratios, le Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) sur un horizon d’un mois et le Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(NSFR) sur un horizon d’un an. L'introduction des ces ratios soulève des questions importantes. 
Certes, le degré de transformation dans le système était excessif, d’autant plus que certains pays ne 
disposaient pas, à la différence de la France, de règles de liquidité. Mais les paramètres techniques des 
3 
 
ratios proposés ont été décidés dans une certaine précipitation et mériteraient un examen plus 
approfondi.  
 
S’agissant du ratio à un mois, j’ai conscience en particulier de l’attention qui doit être accordée à la 
définition des actifs considérés comme suffisamment liquides. Nous avons entendu les remarques des 
praticiens et des analystes sur les conséquences d’une définition trop restreinte du champ des actifs 
éligibles et avons élargi le périmètre en instaurant une catégorie d’actifs liquides de « niveau 2 » 
incluant notamment les covered bonds. Nous avons également veillé à ce que les opérations de 
refinancement auprès des Banques centrales soient convenablement prises en compte puisqu’il s’agit 
d’une source effective de liquidité, et vous aurez observé que celles à moins d’un mois sont très 
largement considérées comme stables.  
 
Ces progrès sont importants mais il reste du travail. A la lumière des enseignements de la crise de la 
dette souveraine, il faut notamment voir si ces aménagements sont suffisants et veiller à ne pas créer 
de biais trop fort en faveur de la couverture des besoins d’emprunt du secteur public.  
 
De même, je suis conscient des interrogations sur le ratio à un an, le NSFR dont l’instauration répond 
à l’objectif d’encourager le financement à plus long terme des banques en limitant le risque de 
transformation excessive. Nous savons là encore que les implications de cette nouvelle norme doivent 
être analysées avec la plus grande attention en prenant notamment en compte la capacité de 
financement de l’économie et la capacité du marché obligataire à absorber un montant substantiel 
d’émissions à moyen et long termes. 
 
Vous l’avez compris, je souhaite qu'une réflexion s'engage à nouveau sur la structure de ces ratios et 
nous sommes particulièrement bien placés, en France, pour contribuer à cette réflexion, puisque nous 
bénéficions de plus de vingt ans d’expérience de mesure et de contrôle prudentiel de la liquidité des 
banques, qui a fait la preuve de son efficacité. Une période d’observation est ouverte et les schémas 
actuels ne doivent pas être considérés comme figés. J’estime, pour ma part, que des inflexions 
significatives sont nécessaires et qu’elles doivent être envisagées sans délai, afin de lever au plus tôt 
une incertitude préjudiciable à la bonne gestion et créatrice d’instabilité.  
 
B. Réduire le risque systémique en adaptant les structures de marché 
Je veux partager avec vous un autre enseignement de la crise : la qualité de la supervision importe 
autant que celle de la réglementation et l’intérêt conjoint des acteurs financiers publics et privés  est 
qu’elle soit élevée. 
La nécessité d’une connaissance plus approfondie des différents marchés et des interactions qui les 
lient est aujourd’hui indéniable. En particulier, la gestion des risques liés aux instruments dérivés 
traités de gré à gré (OTC) doit être améliorée et c’est la conviction qui a conduit le G20 de Pittsburgh 
à adopter une approche commune visant à mieux contrôler ces risques. Deux orientations ont été 
retenues : i) la compensation centralisée par des contreparties centrales (CCP) de tous les produits 
jugés suffisamment standardisés et ii) l’enregistrement de ces transactions par des infrastructures 
dédiées (trade repositories). Ces exigences ont plusieurs objectifs : accroître l’efficience de ces 
marchés, empêcher les fraudes et abus et surtout prévenir le risque systémique généré par les produits 
dérivés. 
 
La volonté des instances de régulation de mettre en place concrètement les orientations du G20 est 
forte. Les États-Unis ont ainsi adopté le Dodd-Frank Act en juillet et les mesures d’application sont en 
négociation. Au niveau européen, les discussions se poursuivent sur le projet de règlement EMIR qui 
devrait être adopté d’ici l’été.  
 
4 
 
Concernant l’enregistrement de l’information, la réforme est déjà largement avancée sur le marché des 
CDS, où le reporting aux trade repositories des principaux acteurs est déjà effectif. Ces premiers pas 
sont encourageants et doivent être poursuivis afin que l’ensemble des classes d’actifs concernées par 
les OTC atteigne le degré de transparence demandé par le G20.  
 
Pour ce qui est des chambres de compensation, la Banque de France accordera une attention toute 
particulière à leur gestion des risques car, centralisant l’ensemble des positions, elles peuvent 
potentiellement être considérées comme des acteurs « super » systémiques. Le renforcement de leur 
robustesse passe par le calibrage adéquat de leurs obligations, comme la définition des fonds de 
garantie, la ségrégation de ces fonds ou par la mise en place de mécanismes d’appel de marges 
robustes mais sans procyclicité inutile. Je pense également que la solidité du dispositif sera mieux 
assurée si ces établissements sont dotés du statut d’établissement de crédit comme c’est le cas en 
France ; cela assure une supervision cohérente avec celle des membres de la chambre et leur permet 
d’avoir accès aux facilités des banques centrales. 
 
III. Approfondir la coopération internationale en cette année de présidence française du G20 
 
Je souhaiterais conclure par une dernière leçon essentielle de la crise : si l’urgence a accru la nécessité 
d’une coopération internationale approfondie, celle-ci doit maintenant être pérennisée.  
Le rôle exact joué par les grands déséquilibres mondiaux dans le déclenchement de la crise fait encore 
débat. Néanmoins, il est une certitude soulignée par les chefs d’État et de gouvernement du G20 : 
« des politiques macroéconomiques incohérentes et mal coordonnées, des réformes structurelles 
inadéquates […] ont conduit à des résultats macroéconomiques globaux insoutenables ».  
 
A Séoul, les chefs d’État et de gouvernement ont donc adopté un « plan d’actions » comprenant des 
mesures globales et coopératives adaptées à chaque pays. La flexibilisation des taux de change compte 
parmi les instruments proposés, mais c’est bien l’ensemble des politiques conjoncturelles et 
structurelles qui doivent pouvoir être mobilisées d’une façon concertée et cohérente pour augmenter le 
potentiel de croissance de l’économie mondiale.  
 
Les évolutions de l’économie mondiale ont aussi des conséquences importantes sur l’architecture 
monétaire internationale. C’est pourquoi la réforme du système monétaire international constitue une 
priorité au centre de la présidence française du G20 pour 2011. 
 
La France souhaite ouvrir le débat. Il ne s’agit pas de lancer un grand bouleversement, mais plutôt de 
prendre la mesure et de tirer les conséquences des évolutions de fond. Je le dis très clairement : le 
système monétaire actuel nous a permis de traverser la crise, mais il faut le faire évoluer afin qu’il soit 
mieux adapté au monde actuel. Il nécessite par exemple des aménagements pour réduire la volatilité 
excessive des flux de capitaux et les mésalignements de taux de change ; il nous faut aussi remédier à 
l’accumulation et la concentration excessive des réserves de change pour tendre ainsi vers un 
rééquilibrage de l’économie mondiale, nécessaire à une stabilité globale durable.  
 
La France souhaite que le G20 établisse un diagnostic commun approfondi sur les causes et les 
conséquences des dysfonctionnements actuels du système monétaire international. Sur cette base, 
différentes options de réforme seront envisagées pour apporter au système des règles plus solides. La 
coopération de tous nos partenaires du G20, avec l’appui du Fonds monétaire international, sera 
particulièrement importante sur ce sujet sensible. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours d’ouverture du VI
Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir à Paris aujourd’hui au Colloque International de la 
Banque de France. Comme vous le savez peut
récurrente, il s’agit en fait de la 6ème édition, mais il prend une tournure tout
cette année, puisqu’il coïncide avec la présidence française du G20. 
Cette présidence s’exerce à un moment clé de la réforme de la gouvernance et de la régulation 
de l’économie mondiale. La thématique d’aujourd’hui, «
Quelle Régulation ? » n’a bien sûr pas été choisie au hasard. Mais au
thématique avec les travaux du G20, ce colloque représente aussi, je l’espère, une excellente 
opportunité d’étendre la réflexion au
échanges avec les dirigeants de Banques centrales (ils sont plus de 100, dans cette salle), les 
responsables publics, les dirigeants du secteur privé, les universitaires de premier plan
toutes les régions du monde, qui no
tiens à remercier chaleureusement. 
L’économie mondiale a connu des évolutions majeures au cours des deux dernières décennies. 
Ces changements ont été facteurs de progrès 
pauvreté - mais ils ont aussi été facteurs de crises. Ainsi l’accélération de la mondialisation des 
années 1990 et 2000 s’est accompagnée d’un essor régulier des déséquilibres mondiaux. Même 
si le rôle joué par ces déséquilibr
débat, leur coïncidence avec la montée de déséquilibres financiers dans plusieurs économies 
envol du crédit et de la titrisation, fortes hausses des prix d’actifs, déficits publics, 
frappante. En bref, la question des déséquilibres mondiaux et celle de la régulation dans une 
économie globalisée sont à l’évidence étroitement liées.
 
Deux grands thèmes transversaux me paraissent particulièrement pertinents pour alimenter nos 
réflexions de ce jour. 
 
 Le premier est celui de l’évolution du système monétaire

retraits soudains de capitaux internationaux ont joué un rôle important dans le déclenchement 
et la propagation des crises financières des quinze dernières années. Cette question est au cœur 
des préoccupations de la présidence française du G20 et il m’apparaît crucial de l’examiner, 
non pas seulement sous l’angle restreint de la gestion des flux de capitaux mais plus largement 
sous l’angle de la liquidité mondiale. 
 
La montée des déséquilibres mondiaux ne se limite d’ailleurs pas aux balances des paiements 
courants. Outre l’accroissement des flux nets de capitaux internationaux, la très forte hausse 
des positions brutes dans les portefeuilles internationaux, pas seulement mais largement liée à 
l’accumulation des réserves de changes officielles des grands pays émergents, est une des 
évolutions les plus marquantes des dernières années. La synchronisation frappante de la crise 
économique récente au sein des principales économies en est sans doute en grande partie la 
conséquence. 
 
Quoiqu’il en soit, la question du niveau adéquat d’offre d’actifs internationaux sûrs et liquides 
et du système monétaire et financier international le mieux à même d’y pourvoir reste posée. 
Cette question est, vous le savez, au cœur de la présidence française du G20. 
Un deuxième grand thème transversal est celui de la coordination économique et financière 
internationale et j’en évoquerai rapidement les deux principaux volets. 
 
Le premier volet concerne le  Cadre  pour une croissance forte, soutenable et équilibrée. 
L’exercice a été largement médiatisé depuis son adoption en septembre 2009 au sommet du 
G20 de Pittsburg. J’incline cependant à penser qu’il a été parfois déformé et qu’on en a sous-
estimé la portée. Cet exercice est en effet prometteur et ambitieux : prometteur, car il peut être 
le vecteur d’un réel enrichissement de la coopération économique internationale, grâce à la 
combinaison de politiques économiques prenant davantage en considération les effets 
d’externalité et de réformes structurelles, afin d’atteindre des objectifs globaux définis en 
commun. Ambitieux, naturellement, car il implique que les pays s’engagent explicitement sur 
des mesures et en discutent les résultats avec leurs pairs, dans le cadre de ce qu’on appelle 
dans le jargon du G20, le « Mutual Assessment Process » (MAP). Sous la présidence coréenne, 
dont j’aimerais saluer ici l’efficacité et la vision, un premier exercice a pu aboutir fin 2010 à 
Séoul à l’adoption d’un plan d’action détaillé par pays et à l’engagement de traiter plus 
spécifiquement les déséquilibres globaux identifiés par des lignes directrices indicatives. Loin 
de moi l’idée de minimiser la difficulté de l’exercice, mais les acquis ne sont pas négligeables, 
et je suis heureux à cet égard que la réunion des ministres et gouverneurs de février à Paris ait 
débouché sur un accord relatif à la définition d’une liste réduite d’indicateurs de référence. 
 
Le deuxième volet concerne la régulation financière. Dans ce domaine, très clairement, nous 
n’en sommes plus au stade des propositions mais pour l’essentiel à celui de la consolidation 
des acquis validés par les chefs d’État et de gouvernement à Seoul, s’agissant en particulier du 
dispositif Bâle 3. L’accord auquel nous sommes parvenus en 2010 a permis de concilier le 
besoin de réformes profondes avec la nécessité de réduire l’incertitude liée aux changements 
règlementaires. La mise en œuvre de ces réformes dans un cadre harmonisé apte à assurer un 
véritable Level playing field est désormais l’enjeu crucial, tant du point de vue de notre 
crédibilité collective que de l’efficacité d’ensemble du nouveau dispositif. Cette avancée très 
significative en matière de régulation financière ne doit pas occulter les progrès qu’il reste à 
 
Page 3 sur 3 
 
faire sur les chantiers en cours, qu’il s‘agisse, en particulier, des infrastructures de marché (y 
compris des marchés de matières premières), d’un encadrement plus strict de ce qui est 
regroupé sous l’appellation shadow banking system, ou du comportement des acteurs des 
marchés eux-mêmes. A nouveau, j’insiste sur notre responsabilité collective qui est de 
s’assurer que tous les pays du G20 et au-delà toute la communauté internationale appliquent 
les standards internationaux.  
 
La discussion d’aujourd’hui va s’articuler autour de quatre grandes sessions. La première, 
animée par Axel Weber, traitera de la notion de déséquilibre après la crise et nous pourrons y 
évoquer l’évolution incertaine des déséquilibres mondiaux à moyen terme, en relation avec 
différentes hypothèses relatives à la croissance et à la dynamique d’épargne dans les 
différentes zones. 
 
Mario Draghi a accepté de piloter la deuxième session, consacrée aux enjeux de la surveillance 
et de la coordination. Le contexte actuel est, comme je viens de le souligner, marqué par la 
réforme de la gouvernance et de la régulation mondiale que le G20 a impulsée. Il semble donc 
opportun d’aborder à ce stade des sujets tels que l’évolution du rôle des institutions financières 
internationales ou les progrès acquis et à venir de l’harmonisation de la régulation financière 
dans le monde. 
 
La troisième session, présidée par Michel Camdessus, doit nous permettre de mieux identifier 
ce que pourrait ou devrait être le rôle des banques centrales après la crise. Les banques 
centrales, par exemple, doivent-elles intégrer de façon plus explicite que ce n’est le cas 
aujourd’hui des considérations de stabilité financière ? Si oui, comment ? Dans quelle mesure 
l’élargissement de leur rôle est-il toujours compatible avec leur indépendance ou même  leur 
mandat d’assurer la stabilité des prix ?  
 
La réforme du système monétaire international sera au cœur de la dernière session, qui prendra 
la forme d’une table ronde animée par Martin Wolf.  
Je suis particulièrement heureux que Bill White ait accepté la difficile tâche d’assurer la 
synthèse de notre colloque qui s’annonce dense et captivant. Je cède la place à Axel Weber 
pour présider la première session, en remerciant à nouveau toutes les personnalités éminentes 
qui ont accepté de participer à ce symposium.

Discours de Christian Noyer pour le Forum international du risque  
sur les risques de long terme (Paris Europlace) 
 
« Les thèmes d’intérêt et les initiatives de la Banque de France dans le domaine de la recherche 
en finance. » 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a great pleasure for me to take part in this fourth edition of the Financial Risks International 
Forum and I warmly thank the organizers for their kind invitation. This year’s forum is dedicated to 
the issue of long-term risks, and what academic research has to say in this regard is of primary 
importance to central banks.  
 
Since you kindly invited me to describe the research activities of the Banque de France in finance, I 
will first emphasize the reasons why a central bank should support financial and economic research. 
In particular I will show that promoting strong interactions between academia and central banks is 
key for the development and sharing of new ideas. In the second part of my address, I will focus 
more specifically on what research brings to the understanding of macro-finance modeling and long-
term risks.  
 
1. In-house research is essential to central banks’ policy assessment.  
 
The Banque de France has promoted research in economics for quite a long time. To my knowledge, 
the oldest piece of evidence of such interest dates back to the mid- 19th century. One of my 
predecessors, Charles Lebègue, who was Governor of the Banque de France between 1857 and 1863, 
opened the Bank’s archives to a young French economist of the time: Clément Juglar. He used the 
data he had access to to define what has been known since then as the Juglar cycle.  
 
The Banque de France has always been keen to share information with researchers and dedicate 
resources to their work. However, healthy intellectual emulation and cooperation within the 
Eurosystem over the last decade and the financial crisis have led to increasing significantly reliance 
on the contribution of well-staffed and highly qualified in-house research teams. By way of example, 
I need only mention the stimulating role of the successive Eurosystem Research networks, from the 
first one on monetary policy transmission in the early 2000s to still on-going ones on macro-
prudential policy and systemic risk analysis. 
 
 
 
2 
 
a) Why should a central bank produce its own research? 
 
- First, our own research may, in some cases, fill the gap between academics’ interests and policy-
making issues. For example, research concerning the money market in the euro area was quite 
scarce in academia before the crisis. The assumption was widely held that banks, given a money 
market rate, would always be able to trade liquidity. From 2004 central banks researchers, at the 
ECB, the Fed and also the Banque de France, began therefore to focus on this research gap and to 
study the mechanisms governing the liquidity of the money market. They concluded at that time 
that, in some circumstances, liquidity may become scarce and volatility may increase on the 
money market due to asymmetric information between banks. They also pointed out that the 
impact of the design of our operational framework on money market dynamics was not neutral 1. 
In retrospect, the outcome of these efforts proved quite useful when we had to analyze the causes 
for the money market freezes of 2007-2008 and to react accordingly in a timely and appropriate 
manner. 
 
- Second, drawing on strong in-house research allows the central bank to track developments in 
methodologies, so that we constantly have state-of-the-art analytical toolboxes for assessing 
monetary and financial conditions and risks. For example, the research carried out at the Banque 
de France over several years in the area of stress tests2 helped us to calibrate the resilience of the 
French banking system at a high frequency well before the EU-wide exercises were carried out.   
 
- Last but not least, drawing on a strong research background is also essential for full credibility in 
the policy debate on the two leading functions of the Bank: monetary policy and financial 
stability.  
 
In short, central banks’ in-house research is essential to back up our policy tools, analyses and 
decisions on the most up-to-date and rigorous scientific basis.  
 
b) For these reasons, developing the Banque de France’s own research capacity has been a 
priority over the past few years 
 
The Banque de France, like other central banks in Europe, has continuously stepped up its 
investment into research. Since 2006, I have personally made policy-oriented research at the Bank 
one of our strategic priorities. I am confident that the result after 5 years is particularly striking. One 
benchmark is the number of articles published by our staff in high-level scientific journals - 51 in 
2010, of which about a third in top academic journals- which has increased considerably. According 
to the quotation-based REPEC index, Banque de France now ranks in the top 20 central banks and 
international institutions, and in the top 5% of research institutions worldwide. This progress is also 
confirmed by the increasing participation of our economists in first-class international conferences 
and workshops like this one. 
 
Our strategy has not just been to increase the amount of resources allocated to internal research but 
also to consolidate our links with the academic world, research institutions, and research departments 
of other central banks and international institutions. For instance, over the last two years, the Bank 
has organized 16 international conferences and workshops featuring some of the most prominent 
experts in their respective fields. The ""Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy” conference co-
organized in Paris with the Chicago Fed, and the ""Economic Linkages, Spillovers and the Financial 
Crisis"" conference co-organized with the Paris School of Economics and the IMF are two recent 
examples of this commitment to stimulate the academic debate on important central banking topics.

2 De Bandt and Oung (2004), Coffinet, Lin and Martin (2009).

On the management side, we have diversified our pool of researchers by intensifying our recruitment 
of highly skilled economists, from young PhD candidates to experienced researchers. The Banque de 
France has notably been participating in the international Job Market for economists for three years 
now, and is identified by candidates as one attractive place in Europe to apply their technical skills to 
challenging real world issues, while still keeping in touch with academia and developing their own 
research agenda.  
 
Furthermore, we strongly encourage our staff to co-write papers and share ideas with academics. The 
Banque de France now benefits enormously from a rich network of highly experienced senior 
academic consultants, some of whom are in this audience and who give an invaluable impetus to new 
ambitious research projects. The Banque de France has also launched over the past three years 
partnerships with prominent universities, such as the Toulouse School of Economics and the Paris 
School of Economics, and research centers like the Cepremap.   
 
Finally, I would like to emphasize the key role of the Fondation Banque de France. Its numerous 
initiatives, including awarding prizes to promising young economists and providing financial support 
to visiting scholars, are also essential contributions to synergies with the academic community. 
 
2. What financial research topics should a central bank focus on? 
 
Because we have limited time, I would like to consider just two issues from the current research 
agenda that are closely connected with the theme of this conference: macro-finance modeling and the 
measurement and consequences of long run risks. 
 
a) Macro-finance modeling  
 
Central banks are increasingly interested in theoretical and empirical research that explores the inter-
linkages between financial markets and the macro-economy. While monetary macroeconomists have 
long tended to neglect the “veil” of financial institutions and arrangements in their policy analyses, 
and financial econometricians have tended to neglect the role of macroeconomic variables in their 
purely financial models of asset prices, the recent crisis has shown that it is of utmost importance to 
bridge this gap and try to reconcile both analytical approaches. The new generation of macro-finance 
modelers - well represented in today’s program - is thus more than welcome to investigate these 
issues. Contrary to “pure” financial models, which certainly do a good job in replicating the 
fluctuations of financial markets, macro-finance models aim by definition at investigating the 
important role of macroeconomic factors in the determination of asset prices. 
 
Macro-finance models, such as DSGE models with explicit sources of financial frictions3 or 
endogenous credit risk4, already help central banks in their everyday practice to better understand 
and anticipate the impact of policy shocks. However, banking and financial market components are 
still scarcely incorporated into these models, leaving room for further research. 
 
Affine term structure models of the yield curve with macroeconomic factors5 represent another 
approach that aims to explain the impact of economic news on asset prices. One recent application is 
the use of these models to reveal the actual value of inflation expectations. The last few months have 
been marked by increasing inflation expectations in the US and the euro area, as gauged by the rise 
                                                     
3 See for instance Beau, Clerc and Mojon (2011) and Antipa, Mengus and Mojon (2011) 
4 Goodhart, Tsomocos and Vardoulakis (2010). 
5 See e.g. Jardet, Monfort and Pegoraro (2011), Borgy, Laubach, Mésonnier, Renne (2011).

in breakeven rates on inflation-linked bonds. Affine term structure models have helped us to 
disentangle pure inflation expectations – that have been indeed quite stable - from inflation risk 
premia – that have been much more varying.  
 
b) Long run risks 
 
Let me now turn to the leading topic of this conference, the assessment and modeling of long run 
risks, which is one of the pervasive sources of uncertainty behind the fluctuations of both asset prices 
and macroeconomic variables.  
 
I really think that it is high time to focus again on long-term issues after three years of financial and 
economic turmoil during which most analyses reduced their time horizons to the short run. Climate 
change and the ageing populations, for instance, remain crucial topics, on which the expertise of the 
researchers is very welcome. Regarding the financial economics of climate change, we have to better 
understand how we could compare the short-run economic costs of environmental policies to the 
very long-term benefits that we expect to reap from them. This calls for an appropriate way of 
discounting the very long-term future, and I am very happy to observe the current development of 
this field of research, both inside6 and outside the Banque de France. 
 
Moreover, population ageing is one of the fundamental economic transformations that our European 
societies are faced with. For instance, the debate on a possible diversification in the funding sources 
of our retirement system is, as it should be, enlightened by the views of the academic community. In 
that regard, we do not only require good forecasts of the evolution of life expectancy in the future; 
we should also be able to assess the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts, the so-called “longevity 
risk”, by whom this longevity risk should be borne and at what price.  
 
Finally, let me suggest here a few avenues for further research that would be of particular interest for 
central banks in the current juncture. 
 
The development of new financial products with very long maturities raises new challenges for us, as 
central bankers and financial regulators. Research gives us the opportunity to better understand the 
risks that these new markets may create for financial stability and design adequate regulatory tools. If 
we think of our objective of maintaining financial stability as oriented towards the medium to long 
run, partly because booms in asset prices and financial imbalances in general often take a long time 
to develop, then we also need to identify which macroeconomic factors impinge on long-term 
financial developments. In spite of outstanding work on these issues since the outbreak of the recent 
crisis, we still need to improve our understanding of the long-run determinants of financial stability. 
 
Now, I am just opening the debate and hoping for your informed answers. Financial crises have at 
least the merit of blatantly revealing the extent of our current ignorance. In this respect, the bad times 
we have been through since 2008 have significantly reduced what Ricardo Caballero (2010) recently 
dubbed the economists’ “Pretense of knowledge syndrome”. However, retrospectively, I do not 
forget that insights gained from research during this period have proved a valuable input for 
decision-making and policy debates. This strongly suggests that central banks’ investment into 
research in finance and financial economics, be it in-house or through partnerships with academia, is 
a valuable asset.  
 
Let me reiterate my pleasure to be here and thank the organizers. I wish you all a fruitful and 
stimulating conference.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Breakfast Economic Club 
New York - 18 avril 
 
 
 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être ici aujourd’hui. C’est également un privilège de m’exprimer 
devant un auditoire d’une telle qualité. J’aimerais saisir cette occasion pour présenter mon 
évaluation de la situation dans la zone euro, eu égard notamment aux difficultés que nous 
connaissons sur le plan de la dette souveraine. 
 
Trois points de vue sur la crise de la dette souveraine en Europe 
 
D’une manière générale, les avis et les opinions exprimés au sujet de la zone euro par les 
non-résidents peuvent être classés en trois catégories : hostilité, pour un très petit nombre de 
personnes du moins, scepticisme et soutien. 
 
Premièrement, la franche hostilité. Il est malheureusement vrai que, dans certains cercles, on 
rencontre une opposition spontanée et profondément ancrée à l’intégration européenne. L’euro étant 
la forme la plus aboutie du projet d’intégration, il est tout à fait naturel qu’il cristallise ces 
oppositions. Les sombres prédictions annonçant la mort imminente de l’euro étaient essentiellement 
celles de commentateurs profondément anti-européens. Si ce point de vue, comme toutes les 
opinions, doit être respecté, il est pour autant inutile de réfuter des arguments en grande partie 
irrationnels et qui traduisent essentiellement des vœux pieux. 
 
2 
 
Deuxièmement, le scepticisme. Il émane principalement, mais pas uniquement, des milieux 
académiques. Des économistes prestigieux et respectés ont fait remarquer que la zone euro n’était 
pas une zone monétaire optimale. Ils ont également souligné que l’insuffisante mobilité de la main-
d’œuvre rendait nécessaire une certaine forme de fédéralisme budgétaire que les dispositifs actuels 
étaient très largement incapables d’offrir. Ces arguments ont cours et font l’objet de débats depuis 
un certain temps déjà ; ils méritent une attention toute particulière. À l’évidence, les récentes 
turbulences et perturbations dans l’articulation des politiques budgétaires nationales ont donné une 
nouvelle actualité à cette thématique. Je reviendrai sur ce point dans un instant. À ce stade, je vous 
rappellerai simplement quelques réponses qui ont été systématiquement formulées au cours des dix 
dernières années. Les avantages de l’euro ne peuvent être mesurés exclusivement à travers le prisme 
de la théorie des zones monétaires optimales. L’euro a apporté une stabilité sans précédent à plus de 
400 millions de citoyens européens. La stabilité des prix, bien évidemment, avec une inflation de 
1,97 % en moyenne au cours des dix dernières années. Et aussi, oui, la stabilité financière. Il est 
toujours utile de recourir au raisonnement contrefactuel lorsqu’on évalue une situation. Abstraction 
faite des turbulences budgétaires actuelles, imaginons, par exemple, de quelle manière l’Europe 
aurait absorbé la crise avec quinze monnaies différentes, des régimes de changes flottants et, par 
conséquent, un niveau beaucoup élevé de volatilité, d’incertitude, de primes de risque et de taux 
d’intérêt. Cette expérience parle d’elle-même.  
 
En outre, de nombreuses études ont montré que les cycles économiques étaient de plus en plus 
synchronisés entre les différents pays de la zone euro. Après avoir atteint un pic en 2009, l’écart 
type des taux de croissance nationaux des pays de la zone est tombé à un niveau historiquement bas. 
Cette convergence a éliminé une asymétrie majeure et rapproche la zone euro du modèle canonique 
de zone monétaire optimale. 
 
La dernière réaction que l’on peut observer est celle du soutien. Elle apparaît dans les commentaires 
d’une majorité d’observateurs et d’investisseurs, notamment des économies émergentes : ils font 
l’éloge de l’euro ; ils souhaitent son succès ; mais ils doutent parfois de notre capacité collective, 
dans les circonstances actuelles, à faire ce qui est nécessaire, à prendre les bonnes décisions au bon 
moment et à mettre en place le cadre approprié pour l’avenir. Ce sont là les problèmes que je 
souhaite aborder à présent.  
 
Où et comment cela a-t-il commencé ?  
 
3 
 
La plupart des pays de la zone euro et des États membres de l’UE sont entrés dans la crise avec des 
situations budgétaires fortement détériorées. Nous étions très éloignés de l’« objectif d’équilibre 
structurel » qui constituait le pilier fondamental de notre cadre budgétaire. Par conséquent, les pays 
ont tous été durement frappés, non seulement par une augmentation des dépenses mais aussi et 
surtout par une diminution substantielle de leurs recettes. Le FMI a montré que, dans l’ensemble 
des pays avancés, y compris aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni, ces pertes représentaient environ 
les deux tiers de la détérioration des situations budgétaires observée durant la crise.    
 
La détérioration budgétaire a été accentuée dans certains pays par le volume des garanties 
généralisées accordées au secteur bancaire. Ces engagements implicites ne sont devenus apparents 
que lorsque les difficultés se sont matérialisées. Tout comme aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni, 
les fragilités du secteur bancaire résultaient essentiellement de l’exposition directe ou indirecte des 
établissements au marché de l’immobilier. 
 
Je précise, au passage, que ces problèmes n’étaient malheureusement pas spécifiques à la zone euro. 
La dette publique a augmenté de 30 % du PIB environ au Royaume-Uni et aux États-Unis. Les 
déficits structurels de ces pays s’établissent à des niveaux analogues ou supérieurs à ceux de la 
plupart des pays de la zone euro. 
 
Dans l’ensemble, la crise a mis en lumière des déficiences majeures dans la mise en œuvre de la 
discipline budgétaire et, plus globalement, de la gouvernance économique dans la zone euro. Il est 
effectivement difficile de piloter une monnaie unique dans un contexte marqué par la multiplicité 
des politiques budgétaires et structurelles nationales.  
 
Compte tenu de l’insuffisance de la discipline de marché, les fondateurs de l’euro avaient anticipé 
le problème et mis en place le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Ses principes étaient solides, son 
cadre adéquat mais sa mise en œuvre a été très insuffisante. Pour parler sans ménagement, la 
pression des pairs n’a pas été capable d’assurer le respect rigoureux et cohérent des principes qui 
avaient été convenus. Il était, et il demeure, nécessaire de réaliser un « saut qualitatif » en matière 
de gouvernance économique. 
 
Qu’avons-nous fait ?  
 
4 
 
Les gouvernements essaient désormais de remédier à ces déficiences. Des progrès considérables ont 
été réalisés au cours de l’année écoulée. 
 
Au plan national, tous les États membres ont engagé des plans crédibles d’assainissement des 
finances publiques qui portent déjà des fruits. 
 
Au niveau de l’UE, un nouveau cadre a été défini. Le premier pilier consiste en un renforcement du 
Pacte de stabilité et de croissance, doté d’un volet préventif beaucoup plus solide. La surveillance 
des politiques budgétaires a été renforcée par une prévention/correction plus efficace des déficits 
excessifs. Les niveaux de dette publique sont mieux pris en compte et les sanctions vont devenir 
plus automatiques. Dans l’idéal, cette discipline européenne devrait désormais être complétée par 
l’adoption, par chaque État membre, de règles budgétaires solides au plan national.  
 
Le deuxième pilier comporte une procédure nouvelle de suivi de la compétitivité et, notamment, des 
coûts unitaires de production.  
 
Enfin, les États membres ont arrêté un nouveau dispositif de gestion de crise pour la zone euro. 
L’expérience a montré la nécessité d’apporter une aide financière temporaire aux pays membres de 
la zone euro confrontés à des difficultés d’accès au financement de marché. 
 
Comme vous le savez, un nouveau mécanisme, le Fonds européen de stabilité financière (FESF), a 
été créé en mai 2010 pour une durée de trois ans. Il a été mis à contribution pour soutenir et financer 
les programmes grec et irlandais. D’un montant nominal fixé à 440 milliards d’euros, sa capacité 
d’intervention effective a été limitée à 250 milliards, un volume qui a sans doute été insuffisant 
pour inspirer confiance aux marchés. En mars dernier, un accord été conclu pour porter cette 
capacité réelle à 440 milliards d’euros.  
 
Les États membres ont également approuvé un dispositif permanent de gestion de crise, dont 
l’entrée en vigueur est prévue en 2013, et qui repose essentiellement sur le Mécanisme européen de 
stabilité (MES), doté d’une capacité effective d’intervention de 500 milliards d’euros. Le MES 
pourra réaliser des interventions à titre exceptionnel sur les marchés primaires de la dette 
souveraine. Des clauses d’action collective (CAC) normalisées et identiques seront intégrées à 
compter de juillet 2013 dans toutes les nouvelles émissions de titres d’État de la zone euro d’une 
5 
 
durée supérieure à un an. Leur base juridique sera conforme à celle des CAC de droit anglais et 
américain. 
 
De façon significative, tous ces mécanismes associent le FMI et la Commission européenne dans un 
processus de «concertation » avec la BCE, afin de ne pas s’appuyer uniquement sur la pression des 
pairs exercée par les autres États membres et de garantir une conditionnalité satisfaisante.  
 
Comme vous le savez, la crise a également conduit l’Eurosystème à engager un programme très 
limité d’achat d’obligations. Nous avons jugé que le mécanisme de transmission de la politique 
monétaire était sérieusement perturbé dans certains cas, les marchés obligataires locaux étant 
proches de la paralysie. Ce programme a fait ses preuves. Son incidence monétaire a été immédiate 
et a été intégralement stérilisée. 
 
Où en sommes-nous ?  
 
Dans l’ensemble, ces évolutions ont été accueillies favorablement par les marchés. Les écarts de 
rendement et les primes de CDS sur la plupart des obligations souveraines ont évolué à la baisse 
depuis janvier. Néanmoins, le sentiment de crise n’a pas encore disparu. Tout récemment, le 
Portugal a formulé la demande d’un programme FMI/FESF. La réussite des programmes existants 
reste à démontrer. L’élaboration très progressive du nouveau cadre n’a pas permis aux analystes 
extérieurs de voir le tableau dans son ensemble et de mesurer l’ampleur des évolutions. 
 
Il y a également une préoccupation plus latente relative à la soutenabilité, que j’aimerais analyser. 
 
Si l’on s’intéresse aux valeurs agrégées, il est très difficile de comprendre nombre d’inquiétudes 
exprimées au sujet de la zone euro. La zone euro est la seule grande zone monétaire dont les 
comptes extérieurs sont équilibrés et qui, de ce fait, ne dépend pas de sources de financement 
externes. Il s’agit là d’un facteur de robustesse déterminant qui représente, pour les investisseurs 
extérieurs, une garantie élevée de solvabilité à long terme. Le solde budgétaire agrégé de la zone 
euro (avec un déficit de 6,3 % du PIB en 2010) est le plus favorable de toutes les économies 
avancées (les États-Unis sont à 10,5 %, le Royaume-Uni à 9,6 % et le Japon à 7,7 %). Il en va de 
même pour la dette publique, qui s’établit à 92 % du PIB, niveau comparable à celui des États-Unis, 
à 93 %, contre 200 % au Japon.  
 
6 
 
Mais, naturellement, les marchés et les analystes ne considèrent pas toujours la zone euro dans sa 
globalité. Les politiques budgétaires restant du ressort national, ils ont tendance à évaluer 
séparément la situation des finances publiques de chacun des pays. Si la plupart des analystes sont 
enclins à reconnaître l’ampleur des efforts accomplis, certains sont très pessimistes sur les 
évolutions à venir. À mon sens, ce pessimisme peut s’articuler autour de deux lignes de 
raisonnement. Premièrement, l’ampleur de l’assainissement budgétaire aura des répercussions 
négatives sur la croissance pendant une très longue période, rendant impossible le service de la 
dette et conduisant inévitablement à une sorte de réaménagement. Et deuxièmement, cette 
stagnation économique déclenchera des réactions politiques fortes qui, finalement, pourraient 
mettre en péril l’existence même de la zone euro. En résumé, tout le raisonnement repose sur 
l’incapacité de la zone euro, et plus précisément des pays situés à sa périphérie, à renouer avec une 
croissance normale dans un avenir prévisible. Il s’agit là d’une hypothèse très inquiétante et qui 
revêt une grande importance dans la mesure où, comme nous le savons tous, la dynamique de la 
dette est très sensible aux prévisions de croissance future. De légers changements dans les 
prévisions peuvent avoir une incidence considérable sur la soutenabilité. Certaines des hypothèses 
implicites qui sous-tendent les appréciations défavorables portées actuellement me semblent 
franchement erronées. 
 
 
Examinons tout d’abord la situation à court terme. Comme vous le savez, nous avons récemment 
été agréablement surpris par la dynamique de croissance dans la zone euro. La confiance des 
consommateurs a pratiquement retrouvé son niveau d’avant la crise, les indices des directeurs 
d’achats sont à des niveaux record et la croissance du PIB dépassera très certainement son potentiel, 
en moyenne, sur l’année 2011. Ces évolutions ont lieu à un moment où des programmes drastiques 
d’assainissement budgétaire sont mis en place dans tous les pays. Les faits contredisent les 
prédictions des analystes, selon lesquels le resserrement budgétaire étouffera la croissance dans la 
zone. Les effets de confiance positifs dans le secteur privé l’emportent sur l’incidence négative de 
la réduction des dépenses publiques. Dans notre jargon économique, il semblerait que le monde 
dans lequel nous vivons aujourd’hui soit « ricardien ». 
 
Qu’en est-il des pays situés à la périphérie ? Le taux de croissance espagnol est passé de - 3,7 % 
en 2009 à - 0,1 % en 2010, en dépit de la mise en place d’un plan d’austérité d’importance majeure. 
Les exportations espagnoles s’envolent, en hausse de 10 % à l’intérieur de la zone euro et de 19 % 
en dehors de la zone en 2010. 
7 
 
 
Dans une perspective de long terme, il est essentiel, lorsque l’on examine les mécanismes internes 
de la zone euro, de distinguer les évolutions réelles des évolutions nominales. Une convergence 
réelle s’opère entre les différentes régions de la zone. À mon sens, elle est appelée à se poursuivre 
et à soutenir la croissance future, contrairement à ce que certains décrivent de manière trop 
simpliste.   
 
Le rattrapage très rapide de la productivité  dans les pays périphériques de la zone a été négligé. 
Entre 2000 et 2008, la croissance cumulée de la productivité du travail, mesurée en termes de 
production par personne employée, était de 14,7 % en Grèce et 10,2 % en Irlande, distançant de 
beaucoup celle de l’Allemagne (6,1 %). C’est exactement ce que l’on peut attendre d’une zone 
intégrée sur les plans monétaire et économique, et ce processus devrait se poursuivre à l’avenir, à 
condition que les politiques appropriées soient mises en œuvre. La convergence économique 
stimulera donc la croissance et favorisera le retour à la soutenabilité de la dette.  
 
La situation est très différente en ce qui concerne les évolutions nominales. Au cours de la même 
période, les salaires nominaux ont augmenté au total de 42 % en Irlande et de 52 % en Grèce, contre 
seulement 7,4 % en Allemagne. La nature du défi est donc claire. Il faut modifier le régime de 
fixation des salaires et des prix nominaux dans certaines régions de la zone euro. En tant que 
banquiers centraux, nous prônons ce changement depuis des années. Point positif de la crise, ce 
message est désormais pleinement accepté par les gouvernements et par l’opinion publique. Dans 
de nombreux pays, des réformes fortes sont actuellement mises en œuvre pour modifier la 
législation du marché du travail et le processus de fixation des salaires dans le secteur public.       
 
Je terminerai par quelques mots sur le secteur bancaire. J’ai le privilège d’être à la fois un banquier 
central et un superviseur et, à ce titre, je ferai quatre remarques :  
 
1/-Les recettes des douze plus grandes banques européennes ont progressé, dans l’ensemble, de 
8,6 % en 2010 (contre 2,5 % pour les principales banques américaines). Par conséquent, les ratios 
de fonds propres durs (Core Tier 1) des banques européennes étaient compris entre 8,5 % et 15,3 % 
fin 2010 (entre 8,4 % et 13,3 % pour les banques américaines). Notre « modèle de banque 
universelle », fondé sur une diversité d’activités et de sources de revenus prouve ainsi sa capacité de 
résistance.    
 
8 
 
2/- Il existe manifestement un lien de causalité circulaire entre la dette publique et le secteur 
bancaire. Les écarts de rendement de la dette publique font naturellement office de plancher pour 
les coûts de financement des banques. Et, à l’inverse, les doutes sur la solvabilité des banques 
créent des attentes en termes de soutien public et des anticipations de détérioration des finances 
publiques. Cela engendre une situation d’équilibres multiples, dans laquelle des retournements 
soudains de la confiance peuvent être auto-réalisateurs et créer des difficultés qui n’existaient pas 
auparavant. Ce processus a été à l’œuvre l’an dernier dans un certain nombre de cas au sein de la 
zone euro. 
 
3/- La finalité principale des tests de résistance est d’enrayer cette circularité. Nos premiers tests 
européens portaient sur 81 banques, contre 19 pour les États-Unis. L’exercice de fond a été mené 
sérieusement, et considéré à sa juste valeur par les analystes lors de sa publication. Toutefois, de 
façon quelque peu maladroite, un petit nombre de banques a été ajouté à cette liste au dernier 
moment, et ces banques, qui avaient seulement subi un examen limité, sont précisément celles qui 
ont posé problème par la suite, minant la crédibilité de la campagne toute entière. Cette erreur ne se 
reproduira pas.  
 
4/- On a beaucoup décrié l’absence de test de résistance souveraine sur le portefeuille bancaire. Et 
en effet, en tant que régulateurs, nous ne voulions pas donner une quelconque crédibilité à un 
scénario que nous considérons comme inacceptable. Cependant, l’information concernant 
l’exposition de chacune des banques à la dette souveraine a été complète, totale et transparente. 
Chacun est libre de faire ses propres hypothèses et ses propres calculs. Lorsque l’on connait le 
niveau d’exposition, il ne faut pas être un génie pour élaborer certains scénarios. Il s’avère que de 
tels calculs produiraient des données très rassurantes. Mais, quelle qu’en soit la raison, ils n’ont 
jamais été réalisés publiquement par la plupart des analystes. Á titre d’exemple, l’exposition totale 
des banques françaises à la dette souveraine des pays du sud de l’Europe s’élève à 38% de leurs 
fonds propres Tier one (13 % sans l’Italie). Je vous laisse tirer vos propres conclusions. Même dans 
le pire des scénarios envisageables, seule une fraction du ratio Tier one des banques françaises 
serait compromise. Les mêmes résultats s’appliquent, à quelques variations près, aux autres pays.  
 
Conclusion  
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure. Comme toutes les autres grandes économies avancées, la 
zone euro relève aujourd’hui des défis importants alors qu’elle s’ajuste à l’environnement d’après la 
crise. Pour tous, ces défis ont trait à la soutenabilité budgétaire à long terme. Ils ne sont ni plus ni 
9 
 
moins importants pour la zone euro que pour les États-Unis, le Royaume-Uni ou le Japon. Ils 
peuvent s’avérer plus difficiles à résoudre parce que notre gouvernance est, par nature, plus 
complexe et que nous sommes confrontés à des problèmes spécifiques d’action collective. Il nous 
faudra sans doute plus de temps pour résoudre les difficultés à mesure qu’elles apparaissent, et nous 
payons le prix de cette relative inertie. Mais nous nous attaquons aux problèmes, nous mettons en 
place des réformes et je suis convaincu qu’à terme, la zone euro émergera plus forte et plus robuste 
qu’avant la crise. Quant au Système européen de banques centrales, je puis vous assurer que nous 
nous tenons prêt à agir aussi fermement que nécessaire afin de garantir la stabilité des prix et de 
préserver l’intégrité de l’euro, qui est, aujourd’hui, notre bien commun le plus précieux.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Tokyo, 16 mai  2011  
 
 
 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être ici aujourd’hui. C’est également un privilège de 
m’exprimer devant un auditoire d’une telle qualité. J’aimerais saisir cette occasion pour 
présenter mon évaluation de la situation dans la zone euro, eu égard notamment aux 
difficultés que nous connaissons sur le plan de la dette souveraine. 
 
Trois points de vue sur la crise de la dette souveraine en Europe 
 
D’une manière générale, les avis et les opinions exprimés au sujet de la zone euro par les non-
résidents peuvent être classés en trois catégories : hostilité, pour un très petit nombre de 
personnes du moins, scepticisme et soutien. 
 
Premièrement, la franche hostilité. Il est malheureusement vrai que, dans certains cercles, on 
rencontre une opposition spontanée et profondément ancrée à l’intégration européenne. 
L’euro étant la forme la plus aboutie du projet d’intégration, il est tout à fait naturel qu’il 
cristallise ces oppositions. Les sombres prédictions annonçant la mort imminente de l’euro 
étaient essentiellement celles de commentateurs profondément anti-européens. Si ce point de 
vue, comme toutes les opinions, doit être respecté, il est pour autant inutile de réfuter des 
arguments en grande partie irrationnels et qui traduisent essentiellement des vœux pieux  
 
Deuxièmement, le scepticisme. Il émane principalement, mais pas uniquement, des milieux 
académiques. Des économistes prestigieux et respectés ont fait remarquer que la zone euro 
 
La zone euro : défis et réponses 
2 
 
n’était pas une zone monétaire optimale. Ils ont également souligné que l’insuffisante 
mobilité de la main-d’œuvre rendait nécessaire une certaine forme de fédéralisme budgétaire 
que les dispositifs actuels étaient très largement incapables d’offrir. Ces arguments ont cours 
et font l’objet de débats depuis un certain temps déjà ; ils méritent une attention toute 
particulière. À l’évidence, les récentes turbulences et perturbations dans l’articulation des 
politiques budgétaires nationales ont donné une nouvelle actualité à cette thématique. Je 
reviendrai sur ce point dans un instant. À ce stade, je vous rappellerai simplement quelques 
réponses qui ont été systématiquement formulées au cours des dix dernières années. Les 
avantages de l’euro ne peuvent être mesurés exclusivement à travers le prisme de la théorie 
des zones monétaires optimales. L’euro a apporté une stabilité sans précédent à plus de 
400 millions de citoyens européens. La stabilité des prix, bien évidemment, avec une inflation 
de 1,97 % en moyenne au cours des dix dernières années. Et aussi, oui, la stabilité financière. 
Il est toujours utile de recourir au raisonnement contrefactuel lorsqu’on évalue une situation. 
Abstraction faite des turbulences budgétaires actuelles, imaginons, par exemple, de quelle 
manière l’Europe aurait absorbé la crise avec quinze monnaies différentes, des régimes de 
changes flottants et, par conséquent, un niveau beaucoup plus élevé de volatilité, 
d’incertitude, de primes de risque et de taux d’intérêt. Cette expérience parle d’elle-même.  
 
En outre, de nombreuses études ont montré que les cycles économiques étaient de plus en plus 
synchronisés entre les différents pays de la zone euro. Après avoir atteint un pic en 2009, 
l’écart type des taux de croissance nationaux des pays de la zone est tombé à un niveau 
historiquement bas. Cette convergence a éliminé une asymétrie majeure et rapproche la zone 
euro du modèle canonique de zone monétaire optimale.  
 
La dernière réaction que l’on peut observer est celle du soutien. Elle apparaît dans les 
commentaires d’une majorité d’observateurs et d’investisseurs, notamment des économies 
émergentes : ils font l’éloge de l’euro ; ils souhaitent son succès ; mais ils doutent parfois de 
notre capacité collective, dans les circonstances actuelles, à faire ce qui est nécessaire, à 
prendre les bonnes décisions au bon moment et à mettre en place le cadre approprié pour 
l’avenir. Ce sont là les problèmes que je souhaite aborder à présent.  
 
Où et comment cela a-t-il commencé ?  
 
La plupart des pays de la zone euro et des États membres de l’UE sont entrés dans la crise 
3 
 
avec des situations budgétaires fortement détériorées. Nous étions très éloignés de l’« objectif 
d’équilibre structurel » qui constituait le pilier fondamental de notre cadre budgétaire. Par 
conséquent, les pays ont tous été durement frappés, non seulement par une augmentation des 
dépenses mais aussi et surtout par une diminution substantielle de leurs recettes. Le FMI a 
montré que, dans l’ensemble des pays avancés, y compris aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni, 
ces pertes représentaient environ les deux tiers de la détérioration des situations budgétaires 
observée durant la crise. 
 
La détérioration budgétaire a été accentuée dans certains pays par le volume des garanties 
généralisées accordées au secteur bancaire. Ces engagements implicites ne sont devenus 
apparents que lorsque les difficultés se sont matérialisées. Tout comme aux États-Unis et au 
Royaume-Uni, les fragilités du secteur bancaire résultaient essentiellement de l’exposition 
directe ou indirecte des établissements au marché de l’immobilier.  
 
Je précise, au passage, que ces problèmes n’étaient malheureusement pas spécifiques à la zone 
euro. La dette publique a augmenté de 30 % du PIB environ au Royaume-Uni et aux États-
Unis. Les déficits structurels de ces pays s’établissent à des niveaux analogues ou supérieurs à 
ceux de la plupart des pays de la zone euro.   
 
Dans l’ensemble, la crise a mis en lumière des déficiences majeures dans la mise en œuvre de 
la discipline budgétaire et, plus globalement, de la gouvernance économique dans la zone 
euro. Il est effectivement difficile de piloter une monnaie unique dans un contexte marqué par 
la multiplicité des politiques budgétaires et structurelles nationales.  
 
Compte tenu de l’insuffisance de la discipline de marché, les fondateurs de l’euro avaient 
anticipé le problème et mis en place le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Ses principes étaient 
solides, son cadre adéquat mais sa mise en œuvre a été très insuffisante. Pour parler sans 
ménagement, la pression des pairs n’a pas été capable d’assurer le respect rigoureux et 
cohérent des principes qui avaient été convenus. Il était, et il demeure, nécessaire de réaliser 
un « saut qualitatif » en matière de gouvernance économique.  
 
Qu’avons-nous fait ? 
 
Les gouvernements essaient désormais de remédier à ces déficiences. Des progrès 
4 
 
considérables ont été réalisés au cours de l’année écoulée. 
 
Au plan national, tous les États membres ont engagé des plans crédibles d’assainissement des 
finances publiques qui portent déjà des fruits. 
 
Au niveau de l’UE, un nouveau cadre a été défini. Le premier pilier consiste en un 
renforcement du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance, doté d’un volet préventif beaucoup plus 
solide. La surveillance des politiques budgétaires a été renforcée par une 
prévention/correction plus efficace des déficits excessifs. Les niveaux de dette publique sont 
mieux pris en compte et les sanctions vont devenir plus automatiques. Dans l’idéal, cette 
discipline européenne devrait désormais être complétée par l’adoption, par chaque État 
membre, de règles budgétaires solides au plan national.  
 
Le deuxième pilier comporte une procédure nouvelle de suivi de la compétitivité et, 
notamment, des coûts unitaires de production. 
 
Enfin, les États membres ont arrêté un nouveau dispositif de gestion de crise pour la zone 
euro. L’expérience a montré la nécessité d’apporter une aide financière temporaire aux pays 
membres de la zone euro confrontés à des difficultés d’accès au financement de marché  
 
Comme vous le savez, un nouveau mécanisme, le Fonds européen de stabilité financière 
(FESF), a été créé en mai 2010 pour une durée de trois ans. Il a été mis à contribution pour 
soutenir et financer le programme irlandais et il sera utilisé pour le programme portugais. 
D’un montant nominal fixé à 440 milliards d’euros, sa capacité d’intervention effective a été 
limitée à 250 milliards, un volume qui a sans doute été insuffisant pour inspirer confiance aux 
marchés. En mars dernier, un accord été conclu pour porter cette capacité réelle à 
440 milliards d’euros. 
 
Les États membres ont également approuvé un dispositif permanent de gestion de crise, dont 
l’entrée en vigueur est prévue en 2013, et qui repose essentiellement sur le Mécanisme 
européen de stabilité (MES), doté d’une capacité effective d’intervention de 500 milliards 
d’euros. Le MES pourra réaliser des interventions à titre exceptionnel sur les marchés 
primaires de la dette souveraine. Des clauses d’action collective (CAC) normalisées et 
identiques seront intégrées à compter de juillet 2013 dans toutes les nouvelles émissions de 
titres d’État de la zone euro d’une durée supérieure à un an. Leur base juridique sera conforme 
5 
 
à celle des CAC de droit anglais et américain.  
 
De façon significative, tous ces mécanismes associent le FMI et la Commission européenne 
dans un processus de «concertation » avec la BCE, afin de ne pas s’appuyer uniquement sur la 
pression des pairs exercée par les autres États membres et de garantir une conditionnalité 
satisfaisante. 
 
Comme vous le savez, la crise a également conduit l’Eurosystème à engager un programme 
très limité d’achat d’obligations. Nous avons jugé que le mécanisme de transmission de la 
politique monétaire était sérieusement perturbé dans certains cas, les marchés obligataires 
locaux étant proches de la paralysie. Ce programme a fait ses preuves. Son incidence 
monétaire a été immédiate et a été intégralement stérilisée.  
 
Où en sommes-nous ?  
 
Dans l’ensemble, ces évolutions ont été accueillies favorablement par les marchés. Les écarts 
de rendement et les primes de CDS sur la plupart des obligations souveraines ont évolué à la 
baisse depuis janvier. Néanmoins, le sentiment de crise n’a pas encore disparu. Tout 
récemment, le Portugal a formulé une demande d’assistance financière auprès de ses 
partenaires européens, ainsi que du FMI. La mise au point d’un programme conjoint FMI/UE 
est en cours. Au niveau européen, le programme portugais d’un montant de 78 milliards 
d’euros devrait être approuvé lors de la prochaine réunion des ministres de l’Économie et des 
finances du 17 mai. Toutefois, la persistance d’un sentiment de crise pourrait tenir également 
au fait que la réussite des programmes existants reste à démontrer. À cet égard, on doit tenir 
compte de l’importance primordiale de la conditionnalité intégrée à ces programmes. Que 
signifie la conditionnalité ? Cela signifie que les pays bénéficiant d’un programme 
d’assistance financière conjoint UE/FMI ont pris l’engagement de réaliser des réformes 
structurelles, dont les avantages et l’incidence positive ne peuvent pas être évalués 
immédiatement. Ces programmes ouvrent la voie à une croissance plus robuste et plus durable 
dans un avenir proche. Si l’on observe les pays d’Europe orientale qui ont reçu un soutien 
financier conditionnel de la part de l’UE et du FMI ces deux ou trois dernières années, on doit 
conclure à la réussite de ces programmes qui se sont avérés très utiles. L’évaluation doit donc 
être prudente avant de devenir définitive. Le temps de la politique économique n’est pas celui 
du sentiment des marchés, et je suis convaincu que les autorités japonaises, confrontées 
6 
 
récemment à des problèmes inconcevables et douloureux, partagent ce point de vue.   
 
Pour revenir à la situation européenne, l’élaboration très progressive du nouveau cadre 
européen n’a pas permis aux analystes extérieurs de voir le tableau dans son ensemble et de 
mesurer l’ampleur des évolutions. En bref, en tout juste un an, depuis mai 2010, l’UE a 
entrepris une refonte radicale de sa gouvernance économique, tout en gérant la crise 
souveraine. Il s’agit d’une grande réussite, surtout si l’on considère la multiplicité des parties 
prenantes et le caractère très innovant de la réponse qui a dû être élaborée dans le respect des 
opinions publiques.  
 
Il y a également une préoccupation plus latente relative à la soutenabilité, que j’aimerais 
analyser.  
 
Si l’on s’intéresse aux valeurs agrégées, il est très difficile de comprendre nombre 
d’inquiétudes exprimées au sujet de la zone euro. La zone euro est la seule grande zone 
monétaire dont les comptes extérieurs sont équilibrés et qui, de ce fait, ne dépend pas de 
sources de financement externes. Il s’agit là d’un facteur de robustesse déterminant qui 
représente, pour les investisseurs extérieurs, une garantie élevée de solvabilité à long terme. 
Le solde budgétaire agrégé de la zone euro (avec un déficit de 6,3 % du PIB en 2010) est le 
plus favorable de toutes les économies avancées (les États-Unis sont à 10,5 %, le 
Royaume-Uni à 9,6 % et le Japon à 7,7 %). Il en va de même pour la dette publique, qui 
s’établit à 92 % du PIB, niveau comparable à celui des États-Unis, à 93 %, contre 200 % au 
Japon.  
 
Mais, naturellement, les marchés et les analystes ne considèrent pas toujours la zone euro 
dans sa globalité. Les politiques budgétaires restant du ressort national, ils ont tendance à 
évaluer séparément la situation des finances publiques de chacun des pays. Si la plupart des 
analystes sont enclins à reconnaître l’ampleur des efforts accomplis, certains sont très 
pessimistes sur les évolutions à venir. À mon sens, ce pessimisme peut s’articuler autour de 
deux lignes de raisonnement. Premièrement, l’ampleur de l’assainissement budgétaire aura 
des répercussions négatives sur la croissance pendant une très longue période, rendant 
impossible le service de la dette et conduisant inévitablement à une sorte de réaménagement. 
Et deuxièmement, cette stagnation économique déclenchera des réactions politiques fortes 
qui, finalement, pourraient mettre en péril l’existence même de la zone euro. En résumé, tout 
7 
 
le raisonnement repose sur l’incapacité de la zone euro, et plus précisément des pays situés à 
sa périphérie, à renouer avec une croissance normale dans un avenir prévisible. Il s’agit là 
d’une hypothèse très inquiétante et qui revêt une grande importance dans la mesure où, 
comme nous le savons tous, la dynamique de la dette est très sensible aux prévisions de 
croissance future. De légers changements dans les prévisions peuvent avoir une incidence 
considérable sur la soutenabilité. Certaines des hypothèses implicites qui sous-tendent les 
appréciations défavorables portées actuellement me semblent franchement erronées.  
 
Examinons tout d’abord la situation à court terme. Comme vous le savez, nous avons 
récemment été agréablement surpris par la dynamique de croissance dans la zone euro. La 
confiance des consommateurs a pratiquement retrouvé son niveau d’avant la crise, les indices 
des directeurs d’achats sont à des niveaux record et la croissance du PIB dépassera très 
certainement son potentiel, en moyenne, sur l’année 2011. Ces évolutions ont lieu à un 
moment où des programmes drastiques d’assainissement budgétaire sont mis en place dans 
tous les pays. Les faits contredisent les prédictions des analystes, selon lesquels le 
resserrement budgétaire étouffera la croissance dans la zone. Les effets de confiance positifs 
dans le secteur privé l’emportent sur l’incidence négative de la réduction des dépenses 
publiques. Dans notre jargon économique, il semblerait que le monde dans lequel nous vivons 
aujourd’hui soit « ricardien ». 
 
Qu’en est-il des pays situés à la périphérie ? Le taux de croissance espagnol est passé de 
- 3,7 % en 2009 à - 0,1 % en 2010, en dépit de la mise en place d’un plan d’austérité 
d’importance majeure. Les exportations espagnoles s’envolent, en hausse de 10 % à 
l’intérieur de la zone euro et de 19 % en dehors de la zone en 2010. Ces résultats sont très 
positifs par rapport à ceux observés tant d’autres pays tant à l’intérieur qu’à l’extérieur de la 
zone euro. 
 
Dans une perspective de long terme, il est essentiel, lorsque l’on examine les mécanismes 
internes de la zone euro, de distinguer les évolutions réelles des évolutions nominales. Une 
convergence réelle s’opère entre les différentes régions de la zone et à mon sens, elle est 
appelée à se poursuivre et à soutenir la croissance future, contrairement à ce que certains 
décrivent de manière trop simpliste.

l’AFTB. Je profite de cette occasion pour saluer la coopération fructueuse qui s’est 
développée entre votre association et la Banque de France. Elle nous est extrêmement 
profitable et je veux croire que vous-mêmes et vos établissements y trouvez également de la 
valeur ajoutée.  
 
 
La liquidité des banques et des marchés est une réalité fascinante à bien des égards car peu 
de phénomènes ont fait l'objet d'une perception aussi différente en une période aussi courte. 
En effet, la liquidité de marché est devenue abondante et bon marché à partir des années 
1980 : les marchés de capitaux gagnaient en profondeur, les coûts de transaction se 
réduisaient. Dans les années 1990, le développement des produits dérivés a facilité la 
gestion et le transfert des risques. Dans la décennie qui a suivi et jusqu'en 2006, l’excès de 
liquidité faisait déjà l’objet de nombreuses études. Puis, lors de la crise financière de 2007-
2008, les sources de financement des banques se sont brutalement taries. Je retiendrai  
trois enseignements de cette crise : 
- Tout d’abord, la crise a rappelé, non seulement que la liquidité avait un prix et que ce 
prix pouvait être particulièrement fluctuant, mais surtout qu’elle ne saurait être tenue 
pour acquise, quel que soit le prix que certains sont prêts a payer ; 
- Ensuite, les banques centrales ont ajusté rapidement et efficacement leurs cadres 
opérationnels de façon à fournir la liquidité au système financier, à normaliser le 
fonctionnement du marché monétaire et à restaurer la confiance. Mais de telles 
mesures doivent bien évidemment rester exceptionnelles, les banques centrales 
devant être attentives aux signaux et incitations qu’elles envoient au système 
financier. 
 
2 
 
- Enfin, par son ampleur, la crise a mis en évidence les risques associés à une activité 
de transformation excessive lorsque des emplois longs sont financés par des 
ressources à très court terme, voire au jour le jour. Cela pose des questions aussi 
bien en termes de gestion du risque de taux que de gestion du risque de liquidité, les 
deux étant distincts mais avec de fortes interactions. Nous ne devons pas avoir la 
mémoire courte et considérer que tout cela est de l’histoire ancienne. Actuellement 
en effet, en période de taux d’intérêt encore extrêmement bas, il est toujours possible 
de financer des actifs à long terme à des coûts très faibles, au risque de créer de 
nouvelles bulles d’actifs. L’exemple du secteur immobilier me semble à cet égard 
révélateur. Le crédit immobilier est devenu un enjeu commercial considérable qui 
peut conduire certains établissements à réduire excessivement leurs marges pour 
fidéliser des clients. Or, ces pratiques contribuent à favoriser une hausse rapide des 
prix immobiliers. 
 
Dès lors, constatant que la liquidité peut disparaitre très rapidement, que l’intervention des 
banques centrales doit rester exceptionnelle et que les positions de transformation 
excessives accentuent le risque systémique, il faut agir dans une logique préventive. Celle-ci 
se conçoit à deux niveaux :  
 
- Je commencerai par évoquer la réglementation de la liquidité dans le cadre du 
Comité de Bâle, en insistant sur l’objectif essentiel : la réduction du risque de liquidité 
et la limitation de la transformation.   
- Toutefois, quels que soient les ajustements qui pourront être apportés au cadre 
réglementaire, cette réponse nécessaire mais globale restera insuffisante si elle n’est 
pas accompagnée, voire précédée, par de nouvelles politiques de maîtrise de la 
gestion de la transformation par les banques.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
 
I. LES GRANDES LIGNES DE LA RÉGLEMENTATION DE LA LIQUIDITÉ SOUS BÂLE III 
 
 
1. Un objectif fondamental : prévenir le risque de  transformation excessif 
 
 
Les  banques sont au cœur des activités de transformation. Parce qu’elles sont les mieux à 
même de réduire les asymétries d’information sur les marchés de crédit, d’effectuer la 
sélection et le suivi des prêts et de diversifier leurs portefeuilles d’actifs. 
 
Dans le cadre d’une intermédiation financière traditionnelle, les banques collectent l'épargne 
et fournissent la liquidité à l’ensemble de l’économie par le biais d’opérations inscrites à leur 
bilan en gérant des actifs peu liquides et à moyen-long terme, tandis que les passifs sont 
plus liquides et à court terme. Cette activité génère des risques bien connus, notamment de 
taux d'intérêt et de liquidité. C’est pourquoi la transformation bancaire est encadrée par une 
réglementation prudentielle, afin d’assurer le respect de règles élémentaires de sécurité.  
 
Les Chefs d’États au sommet du G20 de Séoul en novembre 2010 ont entériné  la réforme 
prudentielle dite de « Bâle 3 » qui renouvelle en profondeur la réglementation en vigueur. 
C’est le rôle en particulier des deux nouveaux ratios de liquidité :  
  
- Le ratio de liquidité à un mois, ou Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a un double objectif : 
prévenir les chocs de liquidité sur un horizon de court terme et obliger les établissements à 
s’auto-assurer contre les situations de pénurie de liquidité afin de limiter le recours exclusif 
au refinancement auprès de la banque centrale, lequel ne doit en aucune manière être 
considéré comme une garantie d’accès permanente. A cet égard, j’observe que la 
recherche de sources de funding en devises n’est pas toujours justifiée par la nécessité de 
financer des actifs libellés dans ces devises en l’absence d’une base clientèle suffisante 
dans le pays concerné.  Elle obéit aussi à des logiques d’arbitrage. Ces stratégies  
contribuent à la liquidité globale des marchés mais leur ampleur doit rester compatible avec 
la capacité des établissements à en assurer le débouclement dans des conditions de 
marché stressées. Or, les situations d’assèchement complet de la liquidité ont rendu 
certains établissements largement dépendants des lignes de swap entre banques 
centrales, comme nous en avons fait l’expérience de fin 2007 à début 2010. Et il est évident 
que le recours aux lignes de swaps entre banques centrales ne peut être considéré comme 
une modalité d’ajustement naturel du marché. Cela justifie que les superviseurs bancaires 
se dotent d’indicateurs permettant de mesurer d’éventuels « mismatch » en devises, sans 
pour autant imposer de ratio spécifique.  
 
4 
 
 
- Le ratio de liquidité à un an,  le Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a vocation quant à lui à 
limiter le risque de transformation excessif tel qu'illustré par la faillite de Northern Rock. 
Concrètement, il est calculé en divisant le montant des ressources stables de 
l’établissement sur un an par le total de ses engagements à un an et doit également 
demeurer supérieur à 100%.  
 
 
2. Une période d’observation nécessaire pour calibrer ces ratios 
 
Si la mise en place de règles quantitatives et harmonisées au plan international constitue 
une avancée majeure, le calibrage actuel des ratios proposés présente des faiblesses 
certaines.  
 
S’agissant du ratio à un mois, il faut revoir la définition de son numérateur, c'est-à-dire la 
définition des actifs liquides de haute qualité qui font une très large place aux titres d’État. La 
crise des dettes souveraines doit nous inciter à être prudents sur le degré de liquidité 
effective de certaines dettes. A l’inverse, les actions dont la liquidité est souvent assurée, 
même en cas de stress de marché, sont exclues des actifs liquides admissibles au 
numérateur. De surcroît, il est quelque peu paradoxal que le collatéral éligible au guichet de 
refinancement des banques centrales à titre habituel -donc sans mise en œuvre de mesures 
non conventionnelles- ne soit pas considéré comme relevant des actifs liquides au sens 
bâlois et pleinement éligibles au numérateur du ratio. 
 
Pour ce qui est du ratio à un an, les interrogations sont très nombreuses, y compris sur le 
plan des principes, dans la mesure où il contraint fortement certaines activités de 
transformation. On doit aussi s’interroger sur la possibilité d’appliquer une seule approche à 
l'ensemble des établissements dans le monde qui présentent forcément des business 
models différents, allant de la banque universelle aux établissements spécialisés (banques 
d’investissement, custodians, etc.). Les impacts de cette norme sur le financement de 
l’économie devront donc être évalués avec la plus grande attention.  
 
 
En appui de ce constat assez critique,  je souhaite souligner trois points :  
 
 En premier lieu, je voudrais rappeler que les banques centrales et les superviseurs sont 
conscients des efforts qui sont demandés aux banques pour la mise en œuvre de la 
 
5 
 
nouvelle réglementation et nous évaluons régulièrement avec elles les modalités 
techniques de ces normes.  
 
 Deuxièmement, il faut distinguer parmi les mesures prévues par la réforme Bâle 3 : 
 
- celles qui sont d’une absolue nécessité, comme la pondération en fonds propres des 
activités de marché, de la titrisation ou du risque de contrepartie sur instruments 
dérivés, et,  
 
- celles, comme les ratios de liquidité, dont il faudra mesurer au préalable l’impact sur 
l’économie réelle. Pour ces derniers, une réelle période d’observation est prévue qui 
doit conduire aux aménagements nécessaires. Les schémas actuels ne doivent donc 
pas être considérés comme figés.  
 
 Enfin, si les règles envisagées peuvent sembler sévères, nous veillerons à ce que leur 
mise en œuvre s’inscrive dans le respect d’un « level playing field ». Toutefois, les 
établissements français restent bien armés pour les respecter. Les grandes banques 
françaises n’ont pas de difficultés à lever des fonds sur les marchés financiers : leur 
taille, leur notation et leur réputation ont jusqu’à présent préservé leur capacité de 
financement.  
 
II. QUELLES VOIES POUR MIEUX MAÎTRISER LE RISQUE DE TRANSFORMATION ?  
 
L’avancement du chantier de la réforme de la régulation prudentielle des banques doit 
s’accompagner d’une poursuite de la réflexion sur le fonctionnement de l’ensemble du 
système financier et sur les différents moyens de mieux maîtriser les risques de liquidité. 
C’est pourquoi, il est nécessaire qu’en complément des réponses réglementaires, les 
banques agissent dès maintenant sur leurs politiques internes de gestion des risques qui 
jouent  un rôle crucial tant au niveau du passif que de l’actif. Je voudrais en dire quelques 
mots. 
 
1. Agir sur le passif 
 
 Tout d’abord, il me paraît important de ne pas attendre le calibrage définitif des nouvelles 
règles pour augmenter progressivement la duration du passif bancaire. La gestion des 
gaps de maturité, qui est de la responsabilité première des trésoriers et des 
gestionnaires ALM, ne peut pas être seulement dictée par la réglementation ; elle doit 
aussi être adaptée au profil de risque de chaque établissement. Dans le contexte actuel, 
 
6 
 
on ne peut qu’inciter les banques à accroître la proportion de ressources émises à 
moyen et long terme sur les marchés, afin de moins dépendre des sources de funding 
plus volatiles. Il convient aussi de réduire, autant que possible, la vulnérabilité de court 
terme envers des financements de marché non sécurisés, notamment en devise. 
 
 Deuxièmement, le traitement des dépôts de la clientèle dans le ratio à un mois, pourrait 
justifier une forme de ré-intermédiation des OPCVM monétaires et une concurrence 
accrue dans la collecte des dépôts bancaires. Nous suivons ces évolutions avec une 
grande attention. L’industrie de la gestion d’actifs est, en effet, un secteur d’activité 
solide que l'on ne doit pas déstabiliser. En outre, la ré-intermédiation de dépôts de 
clients institutionnels ou d’entreprises ne peut se justifier par des considérations de 
ratios réglementaires (compte tenu du traitement sévère réservé à ces dépôts dans les 
projets). Par ailleurs, l’élargissement de la base de dépôts bancaires ne doit pas 
s’exercer à n’importe quel coût : nous suivons ainsi avec beaucoup d’attention 
l’évolution de la rémunération des dépôts.    
 
 Enfin, la sécurisation de l’activité de transformation peut être obtenue en encourageant 
le recours à des sources stables de financement. Je viens d’évoquer la collecte des 
dépôts, il faut aussi évoquer le rôle des émissions de covered bonds. Garantis par un 
portefeuille dédié d’actifs sous-jacents, ces titres se sont montrés résilients pendant la 
crise et jouent depuis un rôle important dans le financement des banques européennes.  
 
2. Agir sur l’actif 
 
Le rééquilibrage de la structure du passif ne saurait suffire à lui seul. D’une manière 
générale, les établissements gagneraient également à s’assurer systématiquement de la 
rentabilité de leurs activités de transformation, en veillant à l'adéquation de la rémunération 
offerte par les actifs par rapport aux risques encourus. Je voudrais souligner ici que la plus 
grande vigilance est requise lorsque les crédits accordés ne permettent pas de dégager des 
marges suffisantes. C’est la tendance préoccupante que l’on observe actuellement pour les 
prêts immobiliers : les marges sur les crédits immobiliers -véritables produits d’appel- sont 
comprimées afin d’attirer une clientèle captive eu égard aux emprunts contractés. Dans ces 
conditions, le niveau des marges pourrait ne pas suffire pour couvrir le coût du risque, voire 
le coût du  funding. 
* 
*   * 
 
 
7 
 
Je voudrais, enfin, insister sur la nécessité de disposer d'une traçabilité précise des flux. 
Dans cette perspective, l’amélioration de la gestion du risque de liquidité lié aux instruments 
dérivés traités de gré à gré, exige un encadrement renforcé des marchés et des acteurs. 
C’est pourquoi, la Banque de France soutient toutes les initiatives engagées allant dans ce 
sens :   
- la compensation centralisée par des contreparties centrales (CCP) de tous les 
produits jugés suffisamment standardisés. La gestion des appels de marge et du 
collatéral y est plus robuste que dans le cas de transactions OTC ; 
- l’enregistrement des transactions par des infrastructures dédiées (trade repositories), 
pour identifier l'ensemble des acteurs systémiques ;  
- l’élargissement du périmètre de la régulation aux acteurs faisant partie du secteur 
non régulé ou « shadow banking ».  
 
Plusieurs réformes sont déjà largement avancées car elles correspondent aux orientations 
du G20. Les États-Unis ont adopté le DODD-FRANK ACT en juillet 2010. Au niveau européen, 
le projet de règlement EMIR devrait être adopté à l'été 2011.  
 
   *   
 *     * 
 
Permettez-moi, pour conclure, de souligner la persistance de certains signaux d’alerte qui 
sont toujours présents. Les niveaux de leviers dans la sphère financière restent en effet très 
élevés. L’environnement actuel de faible taux d’intérêt favorise les stratégies de recherche 
de rendements risqués ; l’activité des marchés high-yield est soutenue ; les innovations sur 
le marché des ETF interrogent et le marché des matières premières se financiarise. La 
gestion active de ces nouveaux instruments complexes risque alors de trouver ses limites 
comme l’a été en son temps celle des CDO.   
 
Pour les banques centrales, le défi posé actuellement est double : c’est améliorer notre 
capacité de surveillance des risques à l’échelle de l’ensemble du système ; c’est aussi, 
rétablir l’aléa moral que la gestion de cette crise a suspendu. Pour leur part, les banques et 
participants de marché doivent veiller à améliorer de manière autonome leur gestion des 
risques afin de réduire cet aléa, dans l’intérêt de leurs actionnaires et déposants, mais 
également de celui du développement économique. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de M. Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Helsinki, 6 juin 2011 
La crise financière : bilan de la situation actuelle 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être ici aujourd’hui à Helsinki. C’est également un privilège 
de m’exprimer devant un auditoire d’une telle qualité.  
 
Toutefois, comme vous le savez tous, le prochain Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE aura 
lieu dans quelques jours et je suis donc tenu à une certaine réserve. Les remarques qui suivent 
sont d’ordre général et ne préjugent pas de la décision du Conseil. 
 
J’aimerais saisir cette occasion pour vous présenter mon évaluation de notre situation, trois 
ans après le début de la crise. Pour des raisons que vous comprendrez certainement, je 
m’attacherai plus particulièrement à la situation en Europe et dans la zone euro.  
 
Les perspectives économiques sont encourageantes 
 
Les récentes évolutions macroéconomiques font état d’une sortie de crise réussie. La reprise 
est désormais généralisée, la plupart des pays du monde ayant renoué avec les taux de 
croissance enregistrés avant la crise. Après un vigoureux rebond, le commerce mondial a 
2 
 
retrouvé la tendance  observée antérieurement à la crise. Les conditions financières sont 
favorables ; les taux d’intérêt à court et long termes se situent en effet à de bas niveaux et on 
n’observe pratiquement pas de signes de rationnement du crédit.  
 
Dans cet environnement international propice, la zone euro a bénéficié d’un premier trimestre 
2011 particulièrement dynamique, soulignant la robustesse de la reprise. Le PIB a augmenté 
de 0,8 % au cours du trimestre, sa croissance atteignant jusqu’à 1,5 % en Allemagne et 1,0 % 
en France. Tous les pays de la zone euro, à l’exception du Portugal, ont présenté des taux de 
croissance positifs. Ces évolutions ne reflètent plus uniquement les programmes de relance 
économique et le cycle des stocks ; elles témoignent d’une reprise généralisée, avec une 
dynamique autonome du secteur privé. Fait notable, au premier trimestre, la croissance en 
France et en Allemagne a été principalement tirée par la demande intérieure privée et, en 
particulier, par l’investissement des entreprises. En France, elle a progressé de 1,9 % en 
rythme trimestriel, affichant une forte croissance pour le quatrième trimestre de suite.   
 
Le rythme de la reprise pourrait se ralentir au cours des trimestres à venir. Les indices du 
climat des affaires, comme celui des directeurs d’achat, l’indicateur du climat économique 
(Economic Sentiment Indicator) ou l’IFO allemand, ont culminé à des niveaux élevés. Au-
delà de ces observations, il se peut que la crise ait  laissé des traces dans nos économies. La 
croissance potentielle a pu être affectée. Le processus de redressement des bilans, qui 
concerne à la fois les agents économiques du secteur public et ceux du secteur privé, pourrait 
également peser sur la croissance à moyen terme.  
 
Néanmoins, les perspectives économiques sont encourageantes. L’OCDE, qui a récemment 
publié ses dernières prévisions, vient de relever ses perspectives de croissance pour la zone 
euro, pour les porter à 2,0 % en 2011 et 2012. 
 
Au total, nous avons de bonnes raisons de croire que nous avons réussi notre sortie de crise. 
Les signes que la reprise est désormais bien engagée se multiplient. Dans un contexte 
d’incertitude toujours élevée, les données économiques récentes confirment la tendance 
positive de l’activité économique dans la zone euro.  
 
La crise de la dette souveraine en Europe  
 
3 
 
Même si les perspectives économiques se sont améliorées, des défis subsistent. Le plus 
important d’entre eux est certainement « la crise de la dette souveraine » dans la zone euro.  
 
D’une manière générale, les avis et les opinions exprimés sur ce sujet par les commentateurs 
extérieurs à la zone euro peuvent être classés en trois catégories : Hostilité, scepticisme et 
soutien.  
 
Premièrement, la franche hostilité. Les sombres prédictions annonçant la mort imminente de 
l’euro étaient essentiellement celles de commentateurs profondément anti-européens. Si ce 
point de vue, comme toutes les opinions, doit être respecté, il est pour autant inutile de réfuter 
des arguments en grande partie irrationnels et qui traduisent essentiellement des vœux pieux.  
 
Deuxièmement, le scepticisme. Il émane principalement, mais pas uniquement, des milieux 
académiques.  Des économistes prestigieux et respectés ont fait remarquer que la zone euro 
n’était pas une zone monétaire optimale et ont souligné qu’une forme quelconque de 
fédéralisme budgétaire faisait défaut pour compenser l’insuffisante mobilité de la main-
d’œuvre.  Je rappellerai simplement quelques faits. Les avantages de l’euro ne peuvent être 
mesurés exclusivement à travers le prisme de la théorie des zones monétaires optimales. 
L’euro a apporté une stabilité sans précédent à plus de 300 millions de citoyens européens : la 
stabilité des prix, bien évidemment, avec une inflation de 1,97 % en moyenne au cours des 
dix dernières années, mais aussi la stabilité financière. Il est toujours utile de recourir au 
raisonnement contrefactuel lorsqu’on évalue une situation. Abstraction faite des turbulences 
budgétaires actuelles, imaginons, par exemple, de quelle manière les pays membres de la zone 
euro auraient absorbé la crise avec quinze monnaies différentes, des régimes de changes 
flottants et, par conséquent, un niveau beaucoup plus élevé de volatilité, d’incertitude, de 
primes de risque et de taux d’intérêt. Cette expérience parle d’elle-même. J’ajouterai 
également que même si les autorités européennes sont perçues comme étant lentes à réagir, 
elles partagent toutes un sens aigu de l’urgence et de la solidarité. Il n’y a ni douce 
insouciance, ni résignation.  
 
La dernière réaction que l’on peut observer est celle du soutien. Elle apparaît dans les 
commentaires d’une majorité d’observateurs et d’investisseurs, notamment des économies 
émergentes : ils font l’éloge de l’euro ; ils souhaitent son succès ; mais ils doutent parfois de 
notre capacité collective, dans les circonstances actuelles, à faire ce qui est nécessaire, à 
4 
 
prendre les bonnes décisions au bon moment et à mettre en place le cadre approprié pour 
l’avenir. Ce sont là les problèmes que je souhaiterais aborder à présent.  
 
Où et comment cela a-t-il commencé ?  
 
La plupart des pays de la zone euro et de l’UE sont entrés dans la crise avec des situations 
budgétaires fortement détériorées, très éloignées de « l’objectif d’équilibre structurel » qui est 
au cœur de notre cadre budgétaire et qui correspond également à l’engagement souscrit par les 
États membres ayant adopté l’euro. Avec la crise, les déséquilibres budgétaires se sont 
accentués, non pas tant en raison d’une augmentation des dépenses que, pour l’essentiel, à 
cause d’une diminution substantielle de recettes. Le FMI a montré que, dans l’ensemble des 
pays avancés, y compris aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni, ces pertes représentaient les 
deux tiers environ de la détérioration des situations budgétaires observée durant la crise. La 
détérioration budgétaire a été aggravée, dans certains pays, par le volume des garanties 
généralisées implicites, qui  se sont matérialisées au fil de la crise via des injections de fonds 
publics dans le secteur financier.  
 
Ces problèmes n’étaient malheureusement pas spécifiques à la zone euro. La dette publique a 
augmenté de 30 % du PIB environ au Royaume-Uni et aux États-Unis. Les déficits structurels 
de ces pays s’établissent à des niveaux analogues ou supérieurs à ceux de la plupart des pays 
de la zone euro. C’est également le cas pour le Japon. 
 
Dans l’ensemble, la crise a mis en lumière des déficiences majeures dans la mise en œuvre de 
la discipline budgétaire et, plus globalement, de la gouvernance économique dans la zone 
euro. Les fondateurs de l’euro avaient mis en place le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance. Ses 
principes étaient solides, son cadre adéquat, mais sa mise en œuvre a été très insuffisante. 
Pour parler sans ménagement, la pression des pairs n’a pas permis d’assurer le respect 
rigoureux et cohérent des principes qui avaient été convenus. Il était, et il demeure, nécessaire 
de réaliser un « saut qualitatif » en matière de gouvernance économique.  
 
Qu’avons-nous fait ?  
 
Les gouvernements s’emploient à remédier à ces déficiences Des progrès considérables ont 
été réalisés au cours de l’année écoulée.  
5 
 
 
Au plan national, tous les États membres ont engagé des plans crédibles d’assainissement des 
finances publiques qui portent déjà des fruits.  
 
Au niveau de l’UE, un nouveau cadre a été défini, qui s’articule autour de trois piliers. Le 
premier pilier consiste en une nette amélioration de l’action préventive : la surveillance des 
politiques budgétaires est renforcée ; les niveaux de dette publique font l’objet d’une 
meilleure prise en compte et les sanctions vont devenir plus automatiques. Dans l’idéal, cela 
devrait être complété par l’adoption, dans chaque État membre, de règles budgétaires solides 
au plan national. Le deuxième pilier comporte une procédure nouvelle de suivi de la 
compétitivité et, notamment, des coûts unitaires de production. Le dernier pilier est le 
nouveau dispositif de gestion de crise arrêté par les États membres de la zone euro, qui a pour 
objectif d’apporter une aide financière temporaire aux pays membres de la zone  confrontés à 
des difficultés d’accès au financement de marché.   
 
Dans le même temps, l’Europe s’est dotée d’une puissance de feu financière.  Comme vous le 
savez, un nouveau mécanisme, le Fonds européen de stabilité financière (FESF), a été créé en 
mai 2010 pour une durée de trois ans. En mars 2011, sa capacité a été portée à un montant 
effectif de 400 milliards d’euros. Les États membres ont également approuvé un dispositif à 
caractère permanent de résolution de crise, dont l’entrée en vigueur est prévue en 2013 et qui 
repose essentiellement sur le Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES), doté d’une capacité de 
prêt effective de 500 milliards d’euros. Le MES permettra la réalisation d’interventions à titre 
exceptionnel sur les marchés primaires de la dette souveraine. Des clauses d’action collective 
(CAC) normalisées et identiques seront intégrées à compter de juillet 2013 dans toutes les 
nouvelles émissions de titres d’État de la zone euro d’une durée supérieure à un an.  
 
De façon significative, tous ces mécanismes associent le FMI et la Commission européenne, 
dans un processus de «concertation » avec la BCE, afin de ne pas s’appuyer uniquement sur la 
pression des pairs exercée par les autres États membres et de garantir une conditionnalité 
satisfaisante.  
 
Comme vous le savez, la crise a également conduit l’Eurosystème à engager un programme 
très limité d’achat d’obligations en vue de remédier aux perturbations du mécanisme de 
6 
 
transmission de la politique monétaire. Ce programme a fait ses preuves. Son incidence 
monétaire a été systématiquement et intégralement stérilisée.  
 
Où en sommes-nous ?  
 
Dans l’ensemble, ces évolutions ont été accueillies favorablement par les marchés. 
Néanmoins, le sentiment de crise n’a pas encore disparu. Tout récemment, un programme 
conjoint FMI/UE d’un montant de 78 milliards d’euros a été approuvé pour le Portugal.  
 
Afin d'apaiser le sentiment de crise persistant, les programmes existants doivent être 
appliqués. À cet égard, leur conditionnalité revêt une importance primordiale. Les pays 
bénéficiant d’un programme conjoint ont pris l’engagement de réaliser des réformes 
structurelles, dont les avantages et l’incidence positive ne peuvent pas être évalués 
immédiatement. Ces programmes ouvrent la voie à une croissance plus robuste et plus 
durable dans un avenir proche.  
 
Pour être absolument clair, il ne fait aucun doute que les pays bénéficiant d’une assistance 
doivent appliquer intégralement leur programme d’austérité. Des solutions s’apparentant à 
une restructuration de la dette ne sont pas envisageables. Elles entraîneraient ces pays dans un 
scénario désastreux, et ceux-ci perdraient durablement l’accès à tout type de financement.    
 
Les programmes peuvent fonctionner et ils fonctionnent effectivement. Si l’on considère les 
pays d’Europe orientale qui ont reçu un soutien financier conditionnel de la part de l’UE et du 
FMI ces deux ou trois dernières années, on doit conclure à la réussite de ces programmes qui 
se sont avérés très utiles. L’évaluation doit donc être prudente avant de devenir définitive. En 
bref, en tout juste un an, depuis mai 2010, l’UE a entrepris une refonte radicale de sa 
gouvernance économique, tout en gérant la crise de la dette souveraine. Il s’agit d’une grande 
réussite, surtout si l’on considère la multiplicité des parties prenantes et le caractère très 
innovant de la réponse qui a dû également tenir compte de l'opinion publique. 
 
Les évolutions positives 
 
Si l’on s’intéresse aux valeurs agrégées, il est très difficile de comprendre nombre 
d’inquiétudes exprimées au sujet de la zone euro. Cette dernière est la seule grande zone 
7 
 
monétaire dont les comptes extérieurs sont équilibrés et qui, de ce fait, ne dépend pas de 
sources de financement externes. Il s’agit là d’un facteur de robustesse déterminant, qui 
représente, pour les investisseurs extérieurs, une solide garantie de solvabilité à long terme. 
Son solde budgétaire agrégé (avec un déficit de 6,3 % du PIB en 2010) est le plus favorable 
de toutes les économies avancées (les États-Unis sont à 10,5 %, le Royaume-Uni à 9,6 % et le 
Japon à 7,7 %). Il en va de même pour la dette publique, qui s'établit à 92 % du PIB, niveau 
proche de celui des États-Unis (93 %) et nettement inférieur à celui du Japon (200 %).  
 
En examinant les situations budgétaires des différents pays, les plupart des analystes seraient 
enclins à reconnaître l’ampleur des efforts accomplis. Certains sont cependant très pessimistes 
sur les évolutions à venir. En résumé, ils soutiennent que la zone euro, et plus précisément les 
pays situés à sa périphérie, seront dans l’incapacité de renouer avec une croissance normale 
dans un avenir prévisible. Il s’agit là d’une hypothèse très inquiétante et qui revêt une grande 
importance dans la mesure où, comme nous le savons tous, la dynamique de la dette est très 
sensible aux prévisions de croissance future.  
 
Certaines des hypothèses implicites qui sous-tendent les appréciations défavorables portées 
actuellement me semblent franchement erronées.  
 
Comme je l’ai fait remarquer au début de mon intervention, nous avons récemment été 
agréablement surpris par la dynamique de croissance dans la zone euro. La confiance des 
consommateurs a pratiquement retrouvé son niveau d’avant la crise, les indices des directeurs 
d’achats sont à des niveaux record et la croissance du PIB dépassera très certainement son 
potentiel, en moyenne, sur l’année 2011. Ces évolutions ont lieu à un moment où des 
programmes drastiques d’assainissement budgétaire sont mis en place dans tous les pays. Les 
effets de confiance positifs dans le secteur privé l’emportent sur l’incidence négative de la 
réduction des dépenses publiques. Qu’en est-il des pays situés à la périphérie ? Le taux de 
croissance espagnol est passé de - 3,7 % en 2009 à - 0,1 % en 2010, en dépit de la mise en 
place d’un plan d’austérité de grande ampleur. Les exportations espagnoles sont en plein 
essor, en hausse de 10 % au sein de la zone euro et de 19 % en dehors de la zone en 2010. Ces 
résultats sont très positifs par rapport à ceux observés dans d’autres pays tant à l’intérieur qu’à 
l’extérieur de la zone euro.  
 
8 
 
Permettez-moi également de vous rappeler qu’une convergence réelle est à l’œuvre dans la 
zone euro. Ce processus est appelé à se poursuivre et à soutenir la croissance future, 
contrairement à ce que certains décrivent de manière trop simpliste. Le rattrapage très rapide 
de la productivité  dans les pays périphériques de la zone a été négligé. Entre 2000 et 2008, la 
croissance cumulée de la productivité du travail, mesurée en termes de production par 
personne employée, a été de 14,7 % en Grèce et de 10,2 % en Irlande, distançant très 
largement celle de l’Allemagne (6,1 %). C’est exactement ce que l’on peut attendre d’une 
zone intégrée sur les plans économique et monétaire, et ce processus devrait se poursuivre à 
l’avenir, à condition que des politiques appropriées soient mises en œuvre. La convergence 
économique stimulera donc la croissance et favorisera le retour à la soutenabilité de la dette.  
 
Il est vrai que le tableau est très différent si l’on considère les évolutions nominales. Au cours 
de la même période, les salaires nominaux ont augmenté au total de 42 % en Irlande et de 52 
% en Grèce, contre seulement 7,4% en Allemagne. Il faut modifier le régime de fixation des 
salaires et des prix nominaux dans certaines régions de la zone euro. En tant que banquiers 
centraux, nous prônons ce changement depuis des années. Dans de nombreux pays, des 
réformes énergiques sont actuellement mises en œuvre pour modifier la législation du marché 
du travail et le processus de fixation des salaires dans le secteur public.  
 
Qu’en est-il des banques ? 
 
Je terminerai par quelques mots sur le secteur bancaire.  
 
Les recettes des douze plus grandes banques européennes ont progressé, en termes agrégés, de 
8,6 % en 2010 (contre 2,5 % pour les principales banques américaines). Par conséquent, les 
ratios de fonds propres durs (Core Tier 1) des banques européennes étaient compris entre 
8,5 % et 15,3 % fin 2010 (entre 8,4 % et 13,3 % pour les banques américaines). Notre 
« modèle de banque universelle », fondé sur une diversité d’activités et de sources de revenus, 
a ainsi prouvé sa capacité de résistance.  
 
Il existe manifestement un lien de causalité circulaire entre la dette publique et le secteur 
bancaire. Les écarts de rendement de la dette publique font naturellement office de plancher 
pour les coûts de financement des banques. Et, à l’inverse, les doutes sur la solvabilité des 
banques créent des attentes en termes de soutien public et conduisent à une détérioration des 
9 
 
finances publiques. Cela engendre une situation d’équilibres multiples dans laquelle des 
retournements soudains de la confiance peuvent être auto-réalisateurs.  
 
Dans ce contexte, la finalité principale des tests de résistance est d’enrayer cette circularité. 
Nos premiers tests européens portaient sur 81 banques, contre seulement 19 pour les États-
Unis. L’exercice de fond a été mené sérieusement, et considéré à sa juste valeur par les 
analystes lors de sa publication. Toutefois, de façon quelque peu maladroite, un petit nombre 
de banques a été ajouté à cette liste au dernier moment, et ces banques, qui avaient seulement 
subi un examen limité, sont précisément celles qui ont posé problème par la suite et miné la 
crédibilité de la campagne toute entière. Cette erreur ne se reproduira pas et la couverture des 
nouveaux tests a été étudiée avec soin.  
 
On a beaucoup décrié l’absence de test de résistance souveraine sur le portefeuille bancaire. 
Et en effet, en tant que régulateurs, nous ne voulions pas donner une quelconque crédibilité à 
un scénario que nous considérons comme inacceptable. Cependant, l’information concernant 
l’exposition de chacune des banques à la dette souveraine sera, comme la dernière fois, 
complète, totale et transparente. Chacun sera par conséquent libre de faire ses propres 
hypothèses et ses propres calculs. Lorsque l’on connait le niveau d’exposition, il ne faut pas 
être un génie pour élaborer certains scénarios. Il est ressorti du dernier exercice que de tels 
calculs produiraient des données très rassurantes. Mais, quelle qu’en soit la raison, ils n’ont 
jamais été rendus publics par la plupart des analystes. Á titre d’exemple, l’exposition totale 
des banques françaises à la dette souveraine des pays du sud de l’Europe s’élève à 38 % de 
leurs fonds propres Tier 1 (13 % sans l’Italie). Je vous laisse tirer vos propres conclusions. 
Même dans le pire des scénarios envisageables, seule une petite fraction du ratio Tier 1 des 
banques françaises serait compromise. Les mêmes résultats s’appliquent, à quelques 
variations près, aux autres pays.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure. Comme toutes les autres grandes économies avancées, 
la zone euro relève aujourd’hui des défis importants alors qu’elle s’ajuste à l’environnement 
d’après la crise. Pour tous, ces défis ont trait à la soutenabilité budgétaire à long terme. Ils ne 
sont ni plus ni moins importants pour la zone euro que pour les États-Unis, le Royaume-Uni 
ou le Japon. Ils peuvent s’avérer plus difficiles à résoudre parce que notre gouvernance est, 
10 
 
par nature, plus complexe et que nous sommes confrontés à des problèmes spécifiques 
d’action collective. Il nous faudra sans doute plus de temps pour résoudre les difficultés à 
mesure qu’elles apparaissent, et nous payons le prix de cette relative inertie. Mais nous nous 
attaquons aux problèmes, nous mettons en place des réformes et je suis convaincu qu’à terme, 
la zone euro émergera plus forte et plus robuste qu’avant la crise. Quant au Système européen 
de banques centrales, je puis vous assurer que nous nous tenons prêts à agir aussi fermement 
que nécessaire afin de garantir la stabilité des prix et de préserver l’intégrité de l’euro, qui est, 
aujourd’hui, notre bien commun le plus précieux.

Conférence Paris-Europlace - 5 et 6 juillet 2011 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
« Les défis actuels du G20 : concilier les nouvelles réglementations et la croissance économique » 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de participer à cette conférence Paris-Europlace et je remercie 
chaleureusement les organisateurs pour leur aimable invitation. Je suis très heureux de présenter cette 
table ronde consacrée à un défi majeur auquel sont actuellement confrontés les régulateurs et les 
décideurs, à savoir concilier harmonieusement les nouvelles réglementations et la croissance 
économique.  
La crise nous a enseigné que les économies de marché peuvent être intrinsèquement instables et que 
les coûts de cette instabilité sont considérables. Qu’il s’agisse du chômage ou de la dette publique, il 
faudra de nombreuses années pour résorber les séquelles de ces quelques mois pendant lesquels le 
système financier mondial a été près de s’effondrer. Les conséquences à long terme restent encore à 
évaluer et, comme vous le savez, certains se demandent si la crise a – ou n’a pas – affecté durablement 
le potentiel de croissance des économies avancées. 
Par conséquent, réduire la tendance de nos économies à enchaîner des cycles d’expansion et de 
récession et atténuer la procyclicité de nos systèmes financiers sont des priorités légitimes de politique 
publique. De ce fait, sous l’impulsion énergique du G20 et de la présidence française, nous nous 
 
2/4 
sommes engagés dans un programme ambitieux de réforme financière dont l’objectif explicite est 
d’empêcher toute réapparition d’épisodes aussi intenses de turbulences financières et d’instabilité. 
Cela étant, il ne peut y avoir de croissance en l’absence de systèmes financiers efficaces et développés 
pour répartir l’épargne, redistribuer les risques et fournir de la liquidité à l’économie. Tout indique que 
les économies financièrement contraintes sont pénalisées en termes d’investissement et de croissance.  
Le problème consiste, par conséquent, à trouver le juste équilibre évoqué par l’intitulé de notre 
session. Au vu de ce que nous avons réalisé jusqu’ici, j’ai le sentiment que nous avançons dans la 
bonne direction. Mais naturellement, les travaux se poursuivent : les régulateurs et les décideurs sont 
en permanence à la recherche d’éléments et d’informations supplémentaires sur le meilleur moyen de 
concilier stabilité et efficacité s’agissant des évolutions de nos systèmes financiers. 
Le principal objectif de nos efforts a consisté à accroître la robustesse des institutions et des 
infrastructures financières. Il n’est pas en notre pouvoir d’éliminer les chocs financiers et la volatilité. 
Il est de notre devoir, en revanche, de nous assurer qu’ils peuvent être absorbés sans conséquences 
excessives pour les institutions elles-mêmes ou pour l’économie dans son ensemble. La constitution de 
volants de sécurité appropriés a donc été une priorité et une nécessité pour mettre les contribuables à 
l’abri des conséquences de turbulences futures. 
En premier lieu et avant tout, un système robuste impose que les banques soient solidement 
capitalisées. Le dispositif Bâle III apportera les principales contributions à ce titre, en renforçant la 
quantité et la qualité des fonds propres des banques. 
Deuxièmement, des progrès sont en cours pour réduire les vulnérabilités intrinsèques aux marchés de 
produits dérivés. En tant que régulateurs, nous avons tendance à penser que la compensation et le 
règlement de ces instruments par le biais de contreparties centrales limitera fortement le risque de 
contrepartie global et les vecteurs de contagion, ce qui renforcera la robustesse d’ensemble du système 
financier. Je suis bien conscient qu’une partie de la communauté financière doute de l’opportunité 
d’une telle évolution. Certains craignent qu’elle n’entraîne une plus grande normalisation des produits 
dérivés et ne qu’elle ne porte préjudice à la flexibilité des marchés. Il s’agit manifestement d’une 
situation dans laquelle le point de vue du marché quant à l’arbitrage optimal entre efficacité et stabilité 
est différent de celui du régulateur. Mais, bien entendu, la vision des régulateurs se concrétise 
naturellement dans la législation et, comme vous le savez, particulièrement dans ce domaine aux États-
Unis. 
Plus généralement, dans l’élaboration de toute nouvelle réglementation financière, deux points de vue 
opposés s’affrontent.  
 
3/4 
L’un est de considérer que les réformes réglementaires pèseront fortement sur l’économie, l’argument 
avancé étant qu’elles augmenteront le coût du financement. L’on craint que les institutions financières 
ne répercutent cette charge sur le secteur privé en relevant les taux débiteurs ou, pire, qu’elles 
abandonnent certains compartiments de financement, ce qui nuirait, pour finir, à la croissance de la 
production.  
Selon le point de vue opposé, une réglementation plus contraignante n’aura aucune incidence négative 
sur la croissance dans la mesure où elle réduira pour l’essentiel la fréquence des crises, ce qui 
améliorera les performances à long terme de l’économie. 
Ces deux approches sont bien étayées et très intéressantes. Elles émanent de cercles assez différents et 
reposent sur des fondements très différents. Après avoir étudié avec attention tous les arguments 
avancés au cours des derniers mois, je vous donnerai mon propre sentiment, à ce stade, sur le juste 
équilibre réglementaire.  
Premièrement, certaines conséquences des nouvelles réglementations sont difficiles à prévoir et 
doivent être soigneusement observées. Quantifier avec précision les effets des réformes sur l’économie 
n’est pas une tâche aisée. La phase d’introduction progressive de Bâle III a été spécialement conçue 
pour pouvoir être conciliée avec la reprise économique et, plus généralement, pour réduire au 
minimum les risques d’incidences défavorables sur les banques et la macroéconomie.   
Deuxièmement, chacun sait également que toute réglementation peut avoir des conséquences 
involontaires. L’une d’elles, bien évidemment, est de créer des opportunités d’arbitrage réglementaire. 
Par conséquent, il est essentiel que les réformes soient appliquées dans leur intégralité et de manière 
homogène d’une juridiction à l’autre. Il est également important de s’assurer qu’une partie importante 
de l’intermédiation financière ne se déplace pas vers le secteur financier non réglementé (ou parallèle), 
ce qui ne contribuerait pas à réduire la probabilité de crises financières brutales.  
Enfin, renforcer la robustesse est une condition nécessaire mais non suffisante pour disposer de 
systèmes financiers plus sûrs. Un autre élément important consiste à faire en sorte que le risque soit 
cantonné à des niveaux acceptables et qu’il soit géré avec prudence. C’est, pour ainsi dire, une 
spécificité de l’approche adoptée dans notre pays. Nous croyons en une surveillance forte et efficace. 
Nous ne pensons pas que des volants de sécurité renforcés puissent se substituer à des autorités de 
surveillance compétentes. Nous sommes d’ardents défenseurs de l’approche du « pilier 2 », pour 
utiliser notre jargon, par laquelle l’autorité de supervision se doit, à tout moment, de vérifier 
l’adéquation des coussins de capital au niveau réel des risques dans le système. Il va sans dire que 
nous sommes également très favorables au développement d’outils macroprudentiels permettant aux 
autorités de détecter et de prévenir les risques systémiques. Tous les cycles économiques n’étant pas 
 
4/4 
synchrones, ces instruments, pour être pleinement efficaces, doivent être créés et mis en place au 
niveau de chaque juridiction et au niveau régional, de manière à prendre en compte les cycles 
nationaux et les risques spécifiques à chaque économie. 
Au total, je peux vous assurer que nous sommes très soucieux de suivre en temps réel les 
conséquences économiques de la régulation financière. Pour la première fois, une évaluation 
économique et systémique du futur dispositif Bâle III a été réalisée. Nous continuerons de l’actualiser 
régulièrement. Un exemple parlant de notre vigilance de tous les instants a trait aux ratios de liquidité 
proposés, dont l’incidence systémique et les implications en termes de politique monétaire font 
actuellement l’objet d’un examen approfondi. 
*** 
En conclusion, permettez-moi de souligner que les autorités sont pleinement conscientes des 
conséquences macroéconomiques possibles des réformes réglementaires et qu’elles sont soucieuses 
d’en limiter les coûts économiques. Au-delà de leurs effets sur la croissance au sens large, il est 
également évident que les nouvelles réglementations ne doivent ni perturber les systèmes financiers ni 
favoriser certains modèles économiques au détriment d’autres.  
Néanmoins, la nécessité est apparue et se fait encore sentir d’évoluer d’un monde financier caractérisé 
par une prise de risque excessive et un arbitrage réglementaire important vers un nouveau système 
caractérisé par une meilleure qualité des fonds propres et une prise en compte accrue du risque. La 
mise en œuvre du corpus de règles de Bâle III approuvé par le G20 fournira les bases nécessaires à un 
tel système, sous réserve que les dispositions transitoires soient respectées et que sa mise en œuvre soit 
coordonnée à l’échelle mondiale.  
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
TOKYO – 3 octobre 2011 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être aujourd’hui parmi vous à l’heure où le monde connaît une période de 
grandes turbulences économiques et alors que le Japon a vécu en cette année 2011, une série de 
catastrophes particulièrement cruelles. Comme vous le savez, j’ai un profond attachement pour votre 
pays et nous, Français, souhaitons témoigner de notre solidarité dans cette série d’épreuves. 
 
Je tiens à remercier sincèrement les organisateurs de ce colloque, qui s’annonce passionnant, de me 
donner ainsi l’occasion de m’exprimer devant vous. 
 
Je remercie le Canon Institute for Global Studies et son président, mon ami le Gouverneur Fukui. Je 
remercie également la Fondation France-Japon de l’EHESS et son directeur, Sébastien Lechevalier. La 
Banque de France a été, en 2009, l’un des premiers soutiens institutionnels de cette Fondation, dont la 
mission – promouvoir les échanges intellectuels et humains entre le Japon et la France, nous tient 
particulièrement à cœur. Nos deux pays ont beaucoup à apprendre l’un de l’autre et beaucoup à gagner 
à une collaboration plus poussée. Je suis donc vraiment ravi de cette initiative. 
 
Au cours des deux derniers mois, des changements importants sont survenus au sein de l’économie 
mondiale. Les perspectives de croissance des économies avancées se sont nettement détériorées, les 
marchés sont de plus en plus volatils et les indices de confiance ont chuté. 
 
Les nouvelles révisions à la baisse de la croissance aux États-Unis ont certainement joué un rôle à cet 
égard. Mais surtout, deux chocs se sont produits presque simultanément : aux États-Unis, il a été 
extrêmement difficile de parvenir à un accord sur le relèvement du plafond de la dette et, en Europe, 
on a reconnu que la Grèce, pays membre de la zone euro et de l’OCDE, ne serait pas en mesure 
d’honorer pleinement ses engagements, à moins d’une participation volontaire du secteur privé à son 
refinancement. Aux yeux du marché, ce constat a eu des implications importantes pour d’autres États 
de la périphérie de l’Europe. 
 
Dans l’ensemble, la capacité des grands pays avancés à rembourser leur dette souveraine a été mise en 
doute. De différentes manières, à des degrés divers et avec des conséquences opposées, c’est la même 
question que l’on pose aujourd’hui de part et d’autre de l’Atlantique : quel est le risque attaché à la 
dette souveraine ? Nous considérions que la dette publique des grands pays était un actif sans risque. 
Ce n’est plus le cas, plus dans la même mesure. 
 
2 
 
En ce sens, on assiste à un véritable changement de régime, avec des conséquences profondes et 
durables, auxquelles je consacrerai ma réflexion d’aujourd’hui. Naturellement, mes propos seront 
surtout centrés sur l’Europe, mais j’adopterai également une perspective plus globale.  
 
Au cours des soixante-dix dernières années, les marchés financiers ont développé une hypothèse forte, 
quoiqu’implicite. La dette publique des économies avancées était considérée comme sans risque. Sur 
cette base, il a été possible de bâtir toute une architecture de prix d’actifs, dont le degré de risque 
relatif est déterminé en fonction des caractéristiques intrinsèques des actifs et de l’appétence des 
investisseurs pour le risque. Le mot important ici est « relatif ». Pour valoriser les actifs financiers, les 
marchés ont besoin d’une base : un taux sans risque. Or, cette base a été ébranlée. 
 
Les conséquences immédiates de cette situation semblent bénignes aux États-Unis. Les marchés ont 
jugé, à juste titre à mon sens, qu’il n’y avait actuellement aucune alternative à la dette américaine 
comme marché le plus liquide et qui reste la référence ultime à l’aune de laquelle le risque peut être 
évalué. En réalité, la dégradation de la dette des États-Unis a été suivie de nouveaux flux 
d’investissements en bons du Trésor et d’une baisse des taux d’intérêt américains sur l’ensemble de la 
courbe des rendements. Dans le même temps, toutefois, un climat d’incertitude omniprésente s’est 
créé, qui pourrait expliquer le recul prononcé de la confiance et des cours des actions ces dernières 
semaines. En Europe, bien entendu, le risque de crédit souverain a eu des conséquences plus 
immédiates et plus dramatiques, avec une hausse brutale des écarts de taux sur la dette souveraine des 
pays de la périphérie à la suite de la déclaration des chefs d’État et de gouvernement de la zone euro, 
le 21 juillet dernier. 
 
Il reste difficile de prévoir comment, à plus long terme, les marchés évalueront la soutenabilité de la 
dette dans les différents pays. Cette évaluation dépend d’un processus complexe dans lequel, de pair 
avec les fondamentaux économiques, des probabilités subjectives, des croyances auto-réalisatrices et 
d’autres influences jouent un rôle majeur. La certitude que la dette serait intégralement remboursée 
constituait dans le passé un point d’ancrage solide des perceptions du marché. Cette certitude ayant 
disparu, la soutenabilité de la dette pourrait bien reposer à l’avenir sur une base plus fragile et volatile. 
 
Comme nous le savons tous, la soutenabilité de la dette dépend de trois variables : l’excédent primaire, 
le taux de croissance et le taux d’intérêt. La relation entre ces trois paramètres et la dette peut être 
exprimée par une équation simple, la fameuse « arithmétique déplaisante ». Il semble donc assez facile 
d’évaluer la soutenabilité. En ce qui concerne la dette souveraine européenne, nombre d’économistes 
et d’analystes de marché se contentent de l’hypothèse d’une croissance durablement faible et de taux 
d’intérêt constamment élevés dans les pays de la périphérie, ce qui les conduit à conclure 
catégoriquement à la non-soutenabilité de la dette. Une version (légèrement) plus élaborée et 
développée de cette hypothèse prend en compte l’impossibilité pour les économies de la zone euro de 
déprécier leur taux de change, ce qui les enfermerait dans un équilibre de faible compétitivité et 
d’absence de croissance.  
 
À mes yeux, ces analyses posent trois grands problèmes. 
 
Tout d’abord, l’hypothèse relative à la compétitivité ne tient pas la route. Prenons l’exemple du 
Royaume-Uni. Son taux de change effectif réel s’est déprécié de 23 % au cours des quatre dernières 
années. Et ses exportations ont enregistré une croissance robuste, de 15% en termes nominaux, au 
cours des six premiers mois de 2011. Or, l’Italie, l’Espagne et la Grèce ont obtenu des résultats encore 
meilleurs, leurs exportations affichant des progressions de, respectivement, 16 %, 19 % et 37 % sur la 
3 
 
même période, et, naturellement, sans ajustement de taux de change. Il est par conséquent trop 
simpliste d’assimiler compétitivité et dépréciation du taux de change. Cela ne signifie pas pour autant 
que les efforts visant à améliorer la compétitivité dans de nombreuses parties de la zone euro ne 
doivent pas être renforcés. Mais cela montre, en tout état de cause, que cela peut être réalisé de 
manière très efficace par le biais d’ajustements internes appropriés. 
 
Deuxièmement, les données agrégées comme les données nationales ne permettent pas de conclure à 
une insoutenabilité généralisée et inévitable des pays situés à la périphérie de l’Europe. 
  
Le déficit budgétaire agrégé de la zone euro s’établira à 4,1 % environ en 2011, soit moins de la moitié 
de celui du Royaume-Uni ou des États-Unis. Il en va de même pour la dette publique, qui atteint 85 % 
dans la zone euro, alors qu’elle va bientôt franchir la barre des 100 % aux États-Unis.  
 
La zone euro est également la seule grande union monétaire présentant des comptes extérieurs en 
équilibre, ce qui constitue un facteur essentiel de robustesse et une garantie solide de solvabilité à long 
terme.  
 
Les pays de la périphérie sont également en train d’améliorer leurs fondamentaux. En 2011, le déficit 
primaire de l’Espagne sera de l’ordre de 4,7 %, soit la moitié de celui des États-Unis et du 
Royaume-Uni. L’Italie sera l’une des très rares économies avancées à dégager un excédent primaire 
dès l’année prochaine. Ces deux pays ont annoncé et adopté d’importants programmes 
d’assainissement budgétaire et de réformes structurelles en vue d’équilibrer leur budget d’ici 2013. 
L’Irlande donne l’exemple parfait qu’un pays présentant un déficit et des taux d’intérêt très élevés peut 
inverser la tendance s’il fait les efforts nécessaires. Le déficit irlandais va revenir de 32 % en 2010 à 
10 % environ en 2011, ce qui va au-delà des exigences du programme de l’UE et du FMI. Dans le 
même temps, la croissance est de retour et sera probablement de l’ordre de 2 % cette année. 
 
Le troisième problème, plus subtil, a trait à la solvabilité et à la liquidité. Lors des périodes difficiles, 
les États, comme les institutions financières, peuvent être soit illiquides, soit insolvables, ou les deux à 
la fois. Dans de nombreux cas, cette distinction est floue. Lorsque l’incertitude est élevée, les États 
sont confrontés à des pénuries de liquidité et n’ont pas d’autre choix que d’émettre de nouveaux titres 
de dette à des taux d’intérêt constamment plus élevés, ce qui amène à douter de leur solvabilité finale, 
déclenchant ainsi une spirale négative. Ce processus est clairement à l’œuvre dans les pays de la 
périphérie de l’Europe, notamment en Espagne et en Italie, depuis début août. 
 
En résumé, la solvabilité souveraine est partiellement endogène. La solidité des fondamentaux est 
absolument nécessaire, mais ne constitue pas toujours une condition suffisante. Lorsqu’on les laisse se 
développer, les spirales de liquidité peuvent enfermer un pays, exactement comme une institution 
financière, dans un mauvais équilibre.  
 
Quelle est, par conséquent, la réaction appropriée de la part des autorités? Nous avons débattu en 
permanence de cette question en 2009 et en 2010 à propos des institutions financières. Nous sommes 
maintenant confrontés à la même question en ce qui concerne le risque souverain. 
 
La réponse standard est double. En premier lieu, il faut renouer avec des fondamentaux solides. Pour 
les pays européens, cela signifie qu’il faut revenir à une situation budgétaire soutenable, ce qui 
nécessite, dans la plupart des cas, un excédent primaire substantiel. Les efforts qu’il faut déployer sont 
désormais plus importants en raison des doutes relatifs à la capacité des États de faire face à leurs 
4 
 
obligations. En second lieu, lorsque la solvabilité est assurée, un soutien en liquidité est nécessaire afin 
de garantir que les mauvais équilibres ne pourront pas se développer.  
 
L’origine de ce soutien constitue une question clé du débat actuel. Dans la plupart des pays, à 
l’exception notable de la zone euro, des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles ont conduit les 
banques centrales à acheter des montants considérables de dette publique : ces achats représentent 
51 % de la dette totale émise depuis 2009 au Royaume-Uni, 21 % aux États-Unis et 7,6 % dans la zone 
euro, où ils ont été totalement stérilisés. Même si cela n’était pas son objectif premier, cette orientation 
a contribué à donner aux marchés une garantie, ou même une assurance, contre un éventuel 
assèchement de la liquidité. Dans tous les pays où les autorités monétaires ont acheté d’importants 
montants de dette, les taux d’intérêt à long terme ont été maintenus à des niveaux très faibles, 
indépendamment de leur situation budgétaire.  
 
En revanche, les achats de dette souveraine par l’Eurosystème sont demeurés extrêmement limités et le 
resteront. Nos objectifs sont clairement circonscrits : il s’agit d’éviter les perturbations du mécanisme 
de transmission de la politique monétaire. Tout soutien durable en liquidité doit provenir des 
gouvernements. C’est pour cette raison que nous avons demandé davantage de flexibilité pour le FESF 
et que nous accueillons très favorablement les décisions prises à cet égard le 21 juillet dernier. La 
question de savoir si les montants sont suffisamment élevés est affaire de jugement. Il ne serait pas 
réaliste d’attendre une augmentation du FESF lui-même mais, en ce qui me concerne, je suis favorable 
à tout mécanisme qui permettrait de donner un effet de levier aux engagements existants afin de 
fournir une plus grande capacité d’intervention.  
 
Pour le moment, l’assurance fournie par la plupart des autorités monétaires peut sembler négligeable, 
l’inflation devant rester faible sur l’horizon des prévisions. Mais cet équilibre pourrait être instable 
dans un autre contexte d’inflation. Tandis que les marchés récompensent actuellement les pays qui 
rendent liquide la dette publique, ils semblent être conscients de certains « risques de perte extrême » 
liés à l’inflation et se protègent par l’achat d’or et de francs suisses, dont les cours ont atteint des 
records historiques.  
 
À ce stade, par conséquent, la zone euro paie une double facture : l’une pour ses erreurs et l’autre pour 
ses vertus. L’erreur, de la part des gouvernements, a été d’autoriser pendant une décennie 
l’accumulation de la dette par le biais de politiques budgétaires insoutenables, et ensuite de créer ex 
nihilo un doute sur leur capacité à rembourser cette dette. Et nous payons également la facture pour 
notre vertu et notre refus de rendre notre dette liquide par une monétisation massive de nos déficits 
budgétaires. 
 
Notre vertu sera-t-elle finalement récompensée ? Je le crois, et pour expliquer pourquoi, il faut se 
placer dans une perspective à plus long terme. Au cours de la prochaine décennie, le monde sera divisé 
en deux : d’un côté, les économies avancées, présentant une capacité d’absorption élevée, une épargne 
faible et une dette importante avec des ratios se situant entre 85 % et 100 % ; de l’autre, les économies 
émergentes, caractérisées par une épargne élevée, un faible endettement (environ 30 % du PIB en 
moyenne) et une capacité d’absorption moindre. Notre prospérité commune dépendra par conséquent 
de notre capacité à mettre en place des canaux et des mécanismes d’intermédiation financière stables 
entre ces deux parties du monde. Il faudra donc absolument disposer d’actifs pouvant être considérés 
comme des réserves de valeur sûres. Comme je le dis depuis le début, la dette publique pourrait ne pas 
jouer ce rôle dans la même mesure que par le passé. L’ultime actif sûr sera par conséquent la monnaie 
elle-même. Les marchés et les prêteurs feront confiance aux monnaies qui, quelles que soient les 
5 
 
circonstances, sont gérées en fonction d’une priorité essentielle : préserver la stabilité des prix et la 
valeur intrinsèque de l’unité monétaire. Pour cette raison fondamentale, nous pouvons envisager 
l’avenir de l’euro avec un optimisme solide et réaliste. À mes yeux, la récente décision de la banque 
centrale suisse d’ancrer le franc suisse à l’euro le confirme. 
 
Quelques mots à présent sur le secteur bancaire et, bien entendu, sur les banques françaises. Tout 
d’abord, les banques ont été affectées dans toutes les économies avancées par la révision à la baisse 
des perspectives de croissance. Depuis août, les primes sur les CDS  et les spreads BOR-OIS ont 
augmenté dans toutes les régions, même si cette évolution a été plus marquée en Europe, signalant 
ainsi une forte montée du risque de contrepartie au niveau mondial. De la même manière, les cours des 
actions bancaires ont fortement chuté partout. La surréaction des cours boursiers peut s’expliquer par 
un simple mécanisme d’amplification : un ralentissement de la croissance signifie une diminution des 
bénéfices et donc des prévisions de dividendes plus faibles. Dans le même temps, les banques sont 
dans l’obligation de constituer des volants de fonds propres supplémentaires, ce qui pèse encore 
davantage sur leur ratio de distribution. Les perspectives en matière de dividendes sont ainsi 
doublement affectées, ce qui explique pourquoi les cours des actions réagissent actuellement si 
fortement aux nouvelles défavorables concernant la croissance. Ce mouvement mondial a été plus 
accentué en Europe en raison d’une troisième incertitude, liée aux expositions des banques au risque 
souverain périphérique.  
 
En outre, les banques françaises ont souffert de deux vulnérabilités spécifiques, l’une bien réelle, 
l’autre exagérée. La vulnérabilité réelle a trait à leur dépendance vis-à-vis des financements en dollars, 
liée à l’importance de leurs activités internationales, situation qu’elles ont peut-être trop tardé à traiter 
efficacement. Elles sont actuellement en train d’y remédier par le biais à la fois d’un désendettement et 
d’une  réduction de  leurs bilans. Dans le   même  temps, afin de  faciliter la transition, comme  le 
problème concerne plus largement les institutions européennes, l’Eurosystème, en collaboration avec 
d’autres banques centrales dans le monde, a décidé de procéder à trois opérations spéciales d’apport de 
liquidité en dollar avec une échéance à trois mois.  
 
Plus exagérées sont les inquiétudes concernant l’exposition des banques françaises au risque souverain 
des pays périphériques. Permettez-moi simplement d’indiquer quelques faits et quelques chiffres : 
l’exposition totale des grandes banques françaises au risque souverain des pays dits « périphériques » 
représente 60 milliards d’euros, soit seulement une fraction limitée de leurs fonds propres durs. La 
politique de refinancement de l’Eurosystème assure une allocation illimitée de liquidité et le total des 
garanties apportées par les banques françaises s’élève à 600 milliards de dollars d’actifs éligibles.  
 
J’observerai que ces deux points de « vulnérabilité » sont une conséquence de l’internationalisation 
des activités bancaires. Il y a quelque chose de paradoxal à une situation dans laquelle des banques 
mondialisées, aux activités diversifiées et aux modèles d’activité équilibrés sont perçues comme étant 
plus risquées que des institutions plus spécialisées.  
 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure. En ces périodes de turbulences, l’Europe joue un rôle particulier 
et doit assumer une responsabilité particulière. Nous sommes à l’épicentre de la crise et pleinement 
conscients de la nécessité de prendre et de mettre en œuvre les bonnes décisions. Comme en 2009, 
toutefois, la crise en elle-même est de nature plus globale. Une nouvelle incertitude est apparue et 
l’interaction entre les marchés et les gouvernements est devenue plus complexe et plus dangereuse. 
Nous vivons en démocratie et devons accepter que les décisions politiques suivent leur cours et 
obéissent à leurs propres contraintes. Dans tous nos pays, l’augmentation de la dette publique et 
6 
 
l’instabilité des finances publiques suscite une énorme inquiétude, d’où la plus grande difficulté à 
prendre les décisions nécessaires. Il y a, néanmoins, de bonnes raisons d’être optimiste. Du côté de 
l’offre, nos économies sont robustes et dynamiques. Les bilans des entreprises sont très solides. Les 
économies émergentes réunissent les conditions nécessaires pour bénéficier d’une croissance soutenue 
et durable au cours des années à venir. Surtout, la communauté des nations semble prête à faire face 
aux défis extraordinaires auxquels nous sommes confrontés. De retour des réunions annuelles du FMI 
et de la Banque Mondiale, je suis frappé par l’esprit de cohésion et par la volonté de coopérer de 
l’ensemble des participants. Comme vous le savez, les banques centrales elles-mêmes coopèrent en 
permanence pour assurer le suivi de la situation et agir si nécessaire, comme elles l’ont fait récemment 
pour fournir des financements en dollars aux banques internationales. Cet esprit de cohésion est notre 
meilleur atout dans le contexte actuel. Nous comptons tous sur des nouvelles avancées en matière de 
coopération internationale à l’occasion du sommet des chefs d’État du G20, à Cannes, en novembre 
prochain.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
La Réunion, 14 novembre 2011 
 
« Enjeux et perspectives de l’économie mondiale » 
 
 
Monsieur le Secrétaire général de la préfecture,  
Mesdames et Messieurs les élus,  
Monsieur le Consul général de Chine,  
Mesdames et Messieurs les représentants des autorités civiles et militaires, 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
C’est un vrai plaisir d’être aujourd’hui devant vous. Et pas seulement parce 
qu’il fait vingt degrés de plus qu’à Paris ou parce que je me suis émerveillé 
tout le week-end devant la beauté de votre île et la gentillesse de ses 
habitants.  
Je suis vraiment heureux d’être avec vous ce soir, parce que je crois qu’il est 
extrêmement important d’échanger directement avec les acteurs économiques 
sur le terrain, partout en France, d’écouter leur vision des choses, d’expliquer 
nos actions. Surtout dans cette période complexe, il me semble que ce lien est 
très précieux.  
Je tiens à saluer et à remercier particulièrement Monsieur le Maire de Saint-
Denis pour son accueil dans cette très belle salle.

Je voudrais profiter de cette occasion pour faire un point sur la crise et les 
réponses qui lui sont apportées. Les derniers mois ont été extrêmement 
chargés en évènements à la fois graves et très complexes. Il est donc logique 
que des incertitudes et un sentiment d’incompréhension se soient développés 
dans la société. Je vais donc essayer d’apporter un éclairage le plus utile 
possible sur la période que nous traversons. Je serais très heureux d’écouter 
vos commentaires ou de répondre à vos questions ensuite.  
 
*** 
 
I. La crise : où en sommes-nous ? 
 
1. Epicentre n°1 : les Etats-Unis entre 2006 et 2008 
 
Pour bien comprendre la crise actuelle, il faut d’abord savoir qu’elle est en 
réalité un nouvel épisode d’une crise profonde qui dure depuis 2006.  
Pourquoi 2006 ? Parce que c’est le moment où le marché immobilier 
américain s’est retourné, où les prix ont commencé à baisser alors qu’ils 
étaient en constante et forte progression depuis plusieurs années. C’est peut-
être difficile à imaginer, mais ce retournement et les problèmes auxquels nous 
sommes confrontés aujourd’hui sont étroitement liés.  
La baisse des prix immobiliers américains a en fait fragilisé fortement les très 
nombreux ménages américains modestes qui avaient contracté des prêts 
adossés à une garantie hypothécaire : les fameux « subprimes ». Quand la 
valeur hypothécaire de leur bien a chuté, les ménages se sont retrouvés dans 
l’incapacité de rembourser leurs prêts. Cela a engendré des pertes, mais très 
limitées à l’origine.  
Comment ces pertes limitées ont-elles pu provoquer la pire crise financière du 
monde depuis 1929 ? Les subprimes avaient en fait été incorporés dans des 
produits financiers extrêmement complexes, mélangés avec d’autres titres de 
créance et revendus à des assureurs ou à des investisseurs. C’est ce qu’on a 
3 
 
appelé les « CDO » qui se sont développés de manière exponentielle dans les 
années 1990 et 2000, pour représenter finalement des montants gigantesques 
au bilan de très nombreuses institutions financières, partout dans le monde. 
Le but de ces opérations était de diluer la prise de risque de crédit. Mais 
quand une base de ces produits – les subprimes – s’est effondrée à partir de 
2006/2007, il est devenu clair, d’une part que le risque n’avait pas disparu, et 
d’autre part qu’à force d’être dilué, il était en réalité omniprésent.  
Là est le nœud du premier épisode de la crise. Les acteurs financiers se 
rendent compte qu’une partie des produits qui circulent sont opaques et 
toxiques ; ils deviennent méfiants. La faillite de certains fonds spéculatifs à 
cause de ces produits à l’été 2007 entraîne un premier gel des marchés 
interbancaires : les banques ne se prêtent plus entre elles. En septembre 
2008, l’effondrement de ce système et la défiance qui l’accompagne culminent 
dans la faillite de la grande banque d’investissement américaine Lehman 
brothers. Le gel des marchés interbancaires et l’ampleur du choc pour les 
banques est encore plus fort et a des impacts immédiats sur l’économie réelle. 
Les crédits à l’économie diminuent, les investissements et le commerce 
international s’effondrent et toutes les régions du monde entrent en récession 
à la fin de l’année 2008.  
Voilà rapidement le scénario du premier acte de la crise. Vous voyez que c’est 
à l’origine une crise immobilière et financière dont l’épicentre était aux Etats-
Unis.  
 
2. Epicentre n°2 : la zone euro depuis 2009 
 
Comment est-on passé de cette première crise à celle que nous connaissons 
en zone euro depuis presque deux ans ? Le lien tient en deux mots : dette 
publique.  
La crise financière de 2008 a en effet eu des conséquences énormes sur les 
finances publiques de la plupart des pays : les recettes fiscales ont diminué à 
cause de la baisse de l’activité ; les dépenses sociales ont augmenté à cause 
4 
 
de la hausse du chômage ; des plans de relance ont dû être mis en œuvre et, 
dans de nombreux pays à l’exception notable de la France, le sauvetage du 
système financier a coûté beaucoup d’argent. Les déficits publics de 
nombreux Etats se sont donc creusés, et leur dette a explosé. Pour vous 
donner un ordre de grandeur, le ratio dette/PIB de la plupart des pays riches a 
augmenté de plus de 20 points entre fin 2007 et aujourd’hui, c’est absolument 
considérable.  
Si les Etats avaient été dans des situations budgétaires saines avant 2007, 
nous n’en serions très clairement pas là aujourd’hui. Mais la plupart des pays 
sont entrés dans la crise avec des déficits et des dettes déjà très dégradés. 
Les créanciers ont commencé à douter de la capacité de certains d’entre eux 
à honorer leurs engagements. La « soutenabilité » de leur dette publique a 
commencé à être remise en cause, alors même que les obligations d’Etat 
étaient considérées depuis des décennies par les marchés comme l’actif le 
plus sûr, l’actif « sans risque ».   
 
L’épicentre de ce deuxième épisode de la crise se trouve depuis deux ans en 
Europe, parce que les premiers doutes sur la soutenabilité d’une dette 
publique d’un pays de l’OCDE sont partis d’un pays de la zone euro : la Grèce.  
Fin 2009, le gouvernement nouvellement élu annonce un déficit public pour 
l’année deux fois supérieur à ce qui était prévu, au-delà des 12% et la dette 
dépasse les 100%. Les créanciers perdent alors subitement toute confiance et 
les taux auxquels la Grèce emprunte explosent, rendant son financement par 
ce biais impossible. Le pays avait en fait accumulé les mauvais choix de 
gestion depuis des années : il n’avait pas fait de réformes structurelles, pas de 
privatisation, il avait augmenté les salaires beaucoup plus vite que la 
productivité et pour couronner le tout, il avait maquillé ses comptes publics. Le 
cocktail était explosif et il a explosé.  
 
5 
 
La dette de deux autres pays de la zone euro a ensuite suscité la défiance 
extrême des marchés : l’Irlande et le Portugal. Il faut malgré tout bien 
différencier les situations.  
L’Irlande a eu une croissance très forte ces dix dernières années et une 
gestion budgétaire exemplaire. Mais elle a commis une double erreur : elle a 
surdéveloppé un secteur bancaire très engagé dans les actifs immobiliers 
anglo-saxons et s’est portée garante de la quasi-intégralité de ce secteur. En 
2010, le pays a subi le choc de la crise financière et immobilière des Etats-
Unis, des banques ont fait faillite et l’Etat a dû intervenir massivement. Le 
déficit budgétaire a donc explosé, provoquant la panique des marchés. Mais 
on voit bien que c’est une crise plus ponctuelle.  
Le cas du Portugal se rapproche plus de celui de la Grèce, même s’il est 
beaucoup moins critique. L’économie portugaise a montré des performances 
structurelles médiocres durant les dernières années. La croissance et la 
productivité ont été faibles et la gestion budgétaire très laxiste. C’est donc 
typiquement une crise de confiance sur la soutenabilité de la dette souveraine 
qui a fait bondir les taux portugais, rendant là-aussi son financement 
autonome impossible dès le mois de mars dernier.  
Ces trois pays : Grèce, Irlande et Portugal ont bénéficié de plans d’aide de la 
part des autres pays européens et du FMI, j’y reviendrai plus en détail dans un 
instant.  
D’autres pays de la zone euro connaissent des conditions de financement très 
tendues depuis quelques mois, sans pour autant avoir eu besoin de plans 
d’aide. Il s’agit en particulier de l’Espagne et de l’Italie. Là aussi, certaines 
fragilités économiques ou politiques associées à des finances publiques 
dégradées attisent les craintes des marchés financiers qui – soit dit en 
passant – ont une fâcheuse tendance à mettre tout le monde dans le même 
panier et à croire que le pire est toujours sûr.  
 
Je veux insister ici sur un point : la crise actuelle n’est pas une crise de l’euro 
mais bien une crise de la dette souveraine. On voit d’ailleurs que toutes les 
6 
 
turbulences qui agitent l’économie depuis plusieurs années sont, finalement, 
dues à l’endettement : l’endettement des ménages américains d’abord, 
l’endettement des Etats ensuite.  
Néanmoins, la crise a révélé depuis fin 2009 des déficiences majeures dans la 
mise en œuvre de la discipline budgétaire et, plus globalement, de la 
gouvernance économique dans la zone euro.   
Les fondateurs de notre monnaie unique avaient mis en place le Pacte de 
stabilité et de croissance, parce qu’ils avaient conscience qu’une union 
monétaire ne fonctionnerait pas sans une discipline budgétaire commune. Ses 
principes étaient solides, il visait l’équilibre budgétaire sur longue période. 
Mais sa mise en œuvre a été très insuffisante.  
Je crois que deux erreurs majeures ont été commises :  
- Premièrement, les Etats –  y compris la France et l’Allemagne – ont 
affaibli le Pacte en ne respectant ni son volet préventif (ils n’étaient pas 
à l’équilibre sur le cycle mais en permanence proche des 3% de déficit), 
ni son volet correctif (ils ne se sont jamais pliés aux sanctions prévues). 
- Deuxièmement, la zone euro ne s’est pas dotée dès le départ d’un 
instrument de suivi de la compétitivité. L’idée de base est importante et 
simple : lorsque l'on adhère à une zone monétaire dont l’objectif affiché 
est une inflation un peu en dessous de 2 %, on doit caler l'évolution de 
ses coûts unitaires de production sur cet objectif de la Banque centrale. 
Dans tous les pays qui ne se sont pas astreints à ce calcul et à cette 
discipline, année après année, il y a eu perte de compétitivité.  
Le fond du problème est que, dès lors que les pays avaient réussi l'examen de 
passage pour entrer dans la zone euro, ils ont considéré qu'ils étaient 
protégés simplement grâce à leur appartenance à la monnaie unique : leurs 
écarts budgétaires ou de compétitivité n’étaient plus sanctionnés par les 
marchés qui prêtaient à tous les pays membres de l’euro au même taux, sans 
distinction. Quand des doutes ont commencé à apparaître, la réaction des 
marchés a été brusque, violente, souvent exagérée, mais il faut admettre que 
de vrais problèmes de fond existaient.  
7 
 
 
II. Les réponses apportées à la crise de la dette en zone euro 
 
Qu’avons-nous fait pour traiter à la fois l’urgence de la crise et les problèmes 
de fond ?  
 
1. Traiter l’urgence de la crise 
 
Pour traiter l’urgence de la crise, d’abord, il fallait que les trois pays qui ont 
connu de grandes difficultés puissent continuer à se financer : les Etats 
européens et le FMI leur ont apporté de l’aide. Ils l’ont fait au travers de prêts 
bilatéraux au départ, puis dans le cadre d’une structure empruntant sur les 
marchés grâce à la garantie des Etats de la zone euro : le Fonds européen de 
Stabilité Financière. Cette aide a toujours été strictement conditionnée au 
respect de programmes de rétablissement des finances publiques du pays en 
question et de restauration de sa compétitivité. Les pays s’engageaient donc à 
respecter des cibles de réduction de déficit, pour in fine, parvenir à nouveau à 
se financer directement sur les marchés. L’aide a donc toujours été conçue 
comme temporaire et incitative à la bonne gestion budgétaire.  
Les banques centrales ont également joué un rôle décisif tout au long de la 
crise. Elles ont d’abord fortement baissé leurs taux directeurs après la crise de 
2008 pour garantir la stabilité des prix et stimuler le crédit et l’activité. Elles ont 
par ailleurs alimenté les institutions financières en liquidités pour limiter les 
contractions de crédit. L’Eurosystème par exemple, exerce depuis 2008 une 
politique de refinancement illimité à taux fixe en contrepartie de garanties 
élargies. Elle s’est aussi engagée depuis 2010 dans un programme d’achat de 
titres de dette publique des pays en difficultés afin de dynamiser le marché, de 
faire baisser la pression sur les taux et ainsi de permettre à sa politique 
monétaire de se transmettre efficacement à l’économie réelle. La coopération 
entre les grandes banques centrales du monde s’est en outre renforcée, 
notamment pour fournir des liquidités en devises étrangères.  
8 
 
 
Les plans d’aide mis en place fonctionnent bien pour le Portugal et pour 
l’Irlande. L’Irlande en particulier a déjà considérablement réduit son déficit, mis 
en œuvre des réformes de structure de son économie très fortes et soutenues 
par un large consensus politique et social. Elle est en avance sur l’exécution 
du programme et a même déjà retrouvé le chemin de la croissance.  
Les choses ne se passent malheureusement pas aussi bien en Grèce. Depuis 
quelques mois, il est apparu que la Grèce ne parviendrait pas à remplir ses 
objectifs de réformes et de réduction des déficits. Cela a renforcé encore les 
inquiétudes des marchés.  
Pour mettre fin à cette situation, les chefs d’Etat et de gouvernement de la 
zone euro et le FMI ont travaillé à un accord obtenu le 21 juillet dernier. Cet 
accord prévoyait des avancées majeures sur plusieurs points :  
- D’abord il mettait en place un nouveau plan d’aide à la Grèce, plus 
adapté à l’évolution de la situation, avec notamment des prêts sur plus 
longue période et à des taux plus faibles 
- Ensuite il comprenait, à titre exceptionnel et unique pour la Grèce, une 
participation volontaire du secteur privé pour alléger la dette du pays et 
lui permettre de rebondir 
- Enfin, cet accord renforçait considérablement les capacités d’action du 
FESF 
Il faut vraiment se rendre compte que ces avancées étaient des avancées 
considérables, du point de vue de l’intégration européenne en particulier. 
Personne n’aurait imaginé cela possible quelques années auparavant. 
Pourtant, elles n’ont pas réussi à contenir la crise.  
A partir du mois d’août dernier, dans un contexte de ralentissement des 
perspectives de croissance, les tensions sur les marchés financiers se sont en 
réalité une nouvelle fois accrues. Un cercle vicieux s’est développé entre le 
risque de défaut de la Grèce, les incertitudes sur la soutenabilité de la dette 
d’autres pays de la zone euro et les secteurs bancaires de la zone. Je 
m’explique. La dette souveraine étant auparavant considérée comme un actif 
9 
 
absolument sûr, les banques en ont acheté beaucoup. En Europe en 
particulier, du fait de l’interdépendance des économies et de la libre circulation 
des capitaux, les banques ont acheté en grande quantité des dettes de tous 
les pays. Ainsi, les banques allemandes, les banques françaises ont une 
exposition relativement importante à la dette grecque, italienne, espagnole. La 
crainte d’un défaut de crédit de ces pays fait donc peser sur les banques une 
menace de pertes importantes. Cette menace, puisqu’elle résulterait in fine 
dans une implication budgétaire des Etats si elle se matérialisait, augmente à 
son tour les craintes sur la solidité budgétaire des pays, et ainsi de suite. 
Comme vous le comprenez, une grande partie de ce mécanisme n’est pas 
complètement rationnel. Seule la situation de la dette grecque est 
véritablement critique, tous les autres pays ont rappelé solennellement leur 
engagement à rembourser intégralement leurs créanciers et leur situation ne 
permet pas d’en douter. J’ai par ailleurs régulièrement rappelé les faits et les 
chiffres exacts concernant l’exposition de nos banques et leur capacité à faire 
face à des scénarios extrêmes. Mais l’engrenage étant activé, il était difficile 
de le stopper.  
Il y a un peu plus de deux semaines, un nouveau sommet européen a proposé 
des solutions encore plus avancées pour calmer la crise. La capacité du FESF 
a été doublée, les fonds propres des banques vont être renforcés plus 
rapidement que prévu et les créanciers de la Grèce ont accepté d’effacer 50% 
de la dette –contre 21% lors de l’accord du 21 juillet.  
Je crois vraiment que ces solutions sont les bonnes. Avec cet allègement de 
créances et les prêts que proposent le FESF, la Grèce peut retrouver un 
chemin de dette soutenable. Je suis convaincu qu’elle y parviendra si les 
accords sont mis en œuvre intégralement et si elle tient ses engagements en 
matière fiscale, en matière de réformes structurelles ou de privatisation. Ces 
efforts sont évidemment douloureux et nécessitent l’adhésion populaire, mais 
ils sont la seule issue favorable pour la Grèce.  
 
 
10 
 
2. Traiter le fond de la crise  
 
Parallèlement au traitement d’urgence des crises successives, il était 
absolument nécessaire pour chacun des Etats de mettre en œuvre tous les 
efforts nécessaires pour retrouver une trajectoire budgétaire saine. Il me 
semble que, à titre individuel, tous les pays de la zone euro ont pris leurs 
responsabilités en ce sens. Leur crédibilité est aujourd’hui en jeu, il faut 
impérativement qu’ils respectent leurs engagements de retour à l’équilibre des 
finances publiques au plus vite. Et la zone euro a par ailleurs 
considérablement renforcé son système de discipline budgétaire : les budgets 
nationaux sont soumis à examen par la Commission, les sanctions sont plus 
automatiques, les mécanismes d’alerte plus pertinents. Un volet nouveau de 
surveillance des déséquilibres macroéconomiques et de compétitivité a en 
outre été mis en place.  
Je dois rappeler ici deux choses. D’une part, l’Europe n’a pas le monopole de 
l’endettement public excessif. Les Etats-Unis ont vu leur notation souveraine 
dégradée cet été et leur processus de politique budgétaire ne paraît pas 
beaucoup plus simple et rapide que celui de la zone euro… D’autre part, en 
termes agrégés, le déficit public de la zone euro est l’un des « moins 
mauvais » parmi les pays développés. Il sera autour de 4.5% fin 2011 alors 
que les Etats-Unis ou le Royaume-Uni sont au double par exemple. Ce n’est 
bien évidemment pas une raison pour ralentir les efforts, au contraire. Mais 
cela montre que notre situation n’est pas si sombre que certaines courbes de 
bourse voudraient nous le laisser penser.  
 
 
III. Les réponses apportées par le G20 aux racines de toute la crise 
 
Nous avons vu qu’il y avait un lien étroit entre les deux épisodes la crise 
depuis 2007, l’épisode américain et l’épisode européen. Ceci montre bien que 
les différentes régions du monde sont face à des enjeux communs, et que les 
11 
 
réponses de fond ne peuvent être que partagées. Dans cette optique, le G20 a 
pris de l’ampleur depuis 2008, et il a déjà apporté des changements de taille.  
La présidence française du G20 s’est achevée il y a une dizaine de jours à 
Cannes. Comme vous l’avez constaté, l’actualité politique grecque a 
largement monopolisé l’attention, de sorte que les principales avancées de 
cette année n’ont peut-être pas reçu toute la lumière qu’elles méritaient. Je 
voudrais donc terminer mon intervention en rappelant quelques une de ces 
avancées :  
- Tout d’abord le G20, le CSF et le comité de Bâle, ont poursuivi leur 
travail de réforme de la régulation financière internationale engagé 
depuis 2009, notamment pour ce qui concerne les institutions à 
caractère systémique 
- Ensuite, le G20 a terminé son travail sur le « cadre pour une croissance 
forte, durable et équilibrée ». Il s’agit de renforcer la coopération 
économique entre les pays et de mieux prendre en compte les impacts 
potentiellement néfastes d’une politique nationale sur le monde. Par 
exemple, les pays en déficit de balance des paiements s’engagent à 
faire des réformes, tandis que les pays en surplus s’engagent à stimuler 
leur demande interne.  
- Le G20 a aussi ouvert le chantier de la réforme du système monétaire 
international. C’est évidemment un chantier de long terme, mais nous 
voyons des signes encourageants, notamment concernant le rôle 
international des monnaies de pays émergents  
- Enfin, les pays du G20 ont pris la pleine mesure du risque d’un 
endettement public excessif. Tous les pays dans cette situation se sont 
engagés à inverser la tendance

C’est la conjugaison de ces solutions nationales, européennes et 
internationales, de court terme et de long terme qui permettra de sortir 
véritablement de la crise.  
Des défis importants sont posés ; ce sont aussi autant d’opportunités pour un 
environnement économique plus stable à l’avenir.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Europe : une crise financière et pas monétaire 
Tokyo-Singapour- 28 et 30 novembre 2011 
 
 
La situation en Europe et dans le monde s’est sensiblement détériorée au cours des dernières 
semaines. Les tensions se sont intensifiées sur les marchés. Les marchés obligataires de la 
zone euro ne fonctionnent pas normalement. Les économies hors de la zone euro ressentent 
les effets d’une incertitude accrue, de perspectives de croissance plus faibles et d’un 
rapatriement de capitaux. Dans ces conditions, il est important de clarifier les mécanismes à 
l’œuvre et d’en identifier les causes sous-jacentes. J’évoquerai également les réponses 
possibles, du point de vue de l’Eurosystème. 
 
La véritable nature de la crise 
 
Je commencerai par un paradoxe. S’agissant des fondamentaux, la zone euro semble 
aujourd’hui en position de force par rapport aux autres économies développées. La croissance 
y est plus forte qu’au Royaume-Uni et au Japon depuis 2007. Les comptes extérieurs sont 
équilibrés. Même la situation budgétaire est favorable. En termes agrégés, le déficit de la zone 
euro est le plus faible de tous, à 4 % du PIB, soit moins de la moitié de celui des États-Unis, 
du Japon ou du Royaume-Uni. Cela reste vrai même dans certains pays de la périphérie. Par 
exemple, le déficit budgétaire de l’Espagne, à 6,1 % du PIB, est très inférieur à celui des 
États-Unis, du Royaume-Uni ou du Japon. La dette publique brute totale, qui s’établit à 67 % 
du PIB, est parmi les plus faibles de l’OCDE. 
 
Au vu de ces chiffres, il est clair que l’Europe dispose des ressources nécessaires pour faire 
face à un besoin de financement gérable dans certaines parties de la région. Et pourtant, elle 
est dans la tourmente. L’explication de ce paradoxe peut être trouvée dans l’examen de la 
véritable nature de la crise. La plupart des observateurs semblent ne voir que les déséquilibres 
budgétaires des économies de la périphérie. Certes, ces déséquilibres ont pu en être le facteur 
déclencheur, mais ce que nous observons aujourd’hui est une véritable crise financière, à 
savoir des perturbations généralisées affectant les marchés financiers. Pour comprendre ce qui 
se passe, il convient de prendre du recul. 
 
L’Europe est la région du monde dans laquelle l’intégration financière est la plus poussée. La 
mobilité des capitaux est totale au sein de l’Union européenne. La réglementation financière 
est presque entièrement harmonisée, les infrastructures financières et les systèmes de 
paiement sont étroitement interconnectés. L’Europe est un authentique marché financier 
unique et, de manière plus importante, un véritable système financier unique.  
 
Le marché unique des capitaux a procuré des avantages significatifs à l’Europe. Les capitaux 
ont afflué vers les pays périphériques, suscitant l’investissement et la croissance. L’intégration 
financière a soutenu et favorisé le processus plus général de convergence économique et 
commerciale. 
 
Dans le même temps, la mobilité des capitaux a été utilisée pour différer l’ajustement 
budgétaire. Les entrées de capitaux ont alimenté une flambée du crédit et des actifs. Les 
déficits des comptes de transactions courantes ont été financés à partir de sources de 
financement fragiles. L’accès aisé au financement a créé une insensibilité aux déséquilibres 
des transactions courantes, ce qui a réduit les incitations à préserver ou à améliorer la 
compétitivité. 
 
Un système financier intégré peut être efficace, mais il n’est pas nécessairement robuste pour 
autant. Plus il est complexe et interconnecté, plus il devient vulnérable à de petits chocs 
localisés, qui peuvent s’aggraver et compromettre la stabilité et l’intégrité de l’ensemble.  
 
C’est ce qui se produit actuellement en Europe, comme on l’a vu auparavant aux États-Unis 
avec les prêts hypothécaires subprime. Dans les deux cas, des problèmes d’ampleur limitée –
la dette publique grecque en ce qui concerne l’Europe – ont eu une incidence 
disproportionnée sous l’effet de mécanismes d’amplification agissant à l’intérieur du système 
financier. 
 
En Europe, trois dynamiques distinctes ont été à l’œuvre. 
 
La première s’exerce entre la solvabilité et la liquidité des débiteurs souverains. En période de 
turbulences, les États, comme les institutions financières, peuvent être soit illiquides, soit 
insolvables, ou les deux à la fois. Dans de nombreux cas, cette distinction est floue. Lorsque 
l’incertitude est élevée, les États sont confrontés à des pénuries de liquidité et n’ont pas 
d’autre choix que d’émettre de nouveaux titres de dette à des taux d’intérêt toujours plus 
élevés, ce qui amène à douter de leur solvabilité finale, déclenchant ainsi une spirale négative. 
 
La solidité des fondamentaux est une absolue nécessité, mais elle ne constitue pas toujours 
une condition suffisante. Lorsqu’on les laisse se développer, les phénomènes d’assèchement 
de liquidité peuvent maintenir un pays, exactement comme une institution financière, en 
mauvaise posture. Ce processus a clairement été à l’œuvre depuis début août dans les pays de 
la périphérie de l’Europe, notamment en Espagne et en Italie. 
 
Une deuxième interaction se produit entre les États et les banques, perçus par les marchés 
comme étroitement liés. De fait, les CDS souverains font office de plancher pour les CDS 
bancaires. Et, inversement, la solvabilité des banques dépend de leur exposition au risque 
souverain. Cette circularité génère de puissants mécanismes de rétroaction qui peuvent 
entraîner un gel total du marché. 
 
Enfin, les banques forment un réseau étroitement interconnecté. Les relations interbancaires 
sont essentielles au bon fonctionnement de l’intermédiation financière. Elles ont été 
gravement perturbées pendant les turbulences actuelles. Il est important de noter, et 
d’accepter, que le risque de contrepartie entre intermédiaires financiers dépend tout autant du 
ressenti que de la réalité. Il a suffi aux banques européennes d’être perçues comme 
vulnérables, même si cela était injustifié, pour connaître des tensions sur les financements. Le 
désengagement significatif des fonds monétaires américains vis-à-vis des banques 
européennes en raison de leur exposition au risque souverain périphérique en est une bonne 
illustration. 
 
Ce que nous avons observé au cours des trois dernières semaines est l’interaction simultanée 
de ces trois dynamiques : solvabilité et liquidité, banques et États, et relations au sein du 
système bancaire lui-même. Tous les pays ont été affectés. Il s’agit notamment, très 
récemment, de tous les pays notés triple A, même l’Allemagne. 
 
Cette analyse appelle de ma part trois conclusions. 
 
Premièrement, la principale faiblesse de l’Europe ne tient pas à la fragilité de l’une de ses 
composantes en particulier. La fragilité de l’Europe vient de sa difficulté à organiser et à 
gérer, en temps de crise, les interactions complexes qui se nouent au cœur de son système 
financier. 
 
Deuxièmement, nous sommes confrontés à une crise financière et non à une crise monétaire. 
Les différences sont considérables. La confiance dans la monnaie est toujours aussi forte. Les 
entrées brutes de capitaux dans la zone euro demeurent inchangées. Le taux de change de 
l’euro reste élevé au regard des évolutions passées (6 % en termes réels au-dessus de sa 
moyenne des dix dernières années). 
 
Enfin, l’interconnexion, qui crée la contagion au sein de l’Europe, est aussi à l’œuvre bien au-
delà de la zone euro. Les tensions sur le secteur bancaire et les marchés se sont transmises à 
l’échelle mondiale. L’Asie a beau être à quelque 10 000 km de l’Europe, pour les marchés 
financiers la distance est couverte en moins de 30 secondes. 
 
Les origines et les causes 
 
Comment la crise a-t-elle pu se développer ? Il y a eu des retards dans le processus de 
décision. La discipline budgétaire n’a pas été respectée dans le passé. Les règles européennes 
n’ont pas été appliquées. Par ailleurs, certaines décisions de politique publique ont eu des 
conséquences involontaires. 
 
Un exemple à cet égard est la participation du secteur privé dans la résolution de la crise de la 
dette souveraine. A priori, elle semble tout à fait judicieuse. Les économistes se plaisent à dire 
qu’une fois la dette devenue insoutenable, il est préférable de la réduire immédiatement.  
 
Au-delà du simple raisonnement économique, la participation du secteur privé est considérée 
comme nécessaire pour éliminer l’aléa moral et garantir la discipline de marché. Lorsque les 
investisseurs ont pris des risques excessifs, ils doivent normalement en payer le prix. Enfin, la 
participation du secteur privé présente un intérêt politique à la fois fort et légitime : les 
contribuables ne sont pas sollicités pour supporter les conséquences du comportement 
irresponsable des emprunteurs et des prêteurs. 
 
Quelle qu’en soit la force, ce raisonnement passe à côté d’un point important. Le marché de la 
dette souveraine est plus qu’un moyen de financement des États. Il est le pilier sur lequel 
s’appuient en définitive tous les systèmes financiers. Au cours des soixante-dix dernières 
années, les marchés financiers ont fonctionné sur l’hypothèse que la dette publique dans les 
économies avancées était effectivement sans risque. Cette base a été ébranlée, tant par la 
participation du secteur privé en Europe que par le débat sur le plafond de la dette aux États- 
Unis. Nous considérions que la dette publique des grands pays était un actif sans risque. Ce 
n’est plus le cas, ou au moins plus dans la même mesure. 
 
Les effets immédiats semblent jusqu’ici bénins aux États-Unis, qui restent le marché 
obligataire le plus profond et le plus liquide du monde. En Europe, en revanche, les 
conséquences ont été plus dramatiques. Une fois que le risque de crédit est intégré dans les 
obligations souveraines, c’est un élément fondamental d’instabilité que l’on a introduit. C’est 
la raison pour laquelle, malheureusement, la déclaration forte, dans le communiqué des chefs 
d’État ou de gouvernement de la zone euro du 21 juillet, selon laquelle la Grèce était un cas 
unique et exceptionnel, n’a pas eu d’effet sur les marchés et a été suivie d’un creusement des 
écarts de rendement sur les obligations souveraines pour l’ensemble des pays périphériques. 
 
Une deuxième décision, plus récente, pourrait avoir contribué à l’intensification des 
turbulences actuelles. Les régulateurs européens, sous l’égide de l’Autorité bancaire 
européenne, ont décidé à juste titre que les banques devaient détenir davantage de fonds 
propres afin de faire face au contexte actuel d’incertitude accrue. Une échéance leur a été 
fixée pour qu’elles atteignent un ratio de fonds propres durs de 9 %, sur la base d’une 
définition communément admise des fonds propres.  
 
Malheureusement, toutefois, le calibrage pour cet exercice intégrait explicitement une 
valorisation au prix du marché de l’exposition de chaque banque à la dette souveraine. Bien 
que cet élément du calibrage ait été considéré comme étant effectué une fois pour toutes, dans 
le seul objectif de calculer un coussin de fonds propres supplémentaires au-delà de l’objectif 
de 9 %, le marché a pris en compte le risque que l’exercice puisse être renouvelé dans 
d’autres circonstances.  
 
Cela a fortement découragé la détention et, a fortiori, l’acquisition de ces titres de dette, les 
banques estimant qu’elles pourraient être pénalisées à l’avenir. Les banques sont des acteurs 
essentiels sur les marchés de la dette souveraine et ce n’est certainement pas une coïncidence 
si la liquidité s’est asséchée et si les écarts de rendement se sont creusés sur la plupart des 
marchés dans les jours qui ont suivi cette décision. 
 
Les réponses de politique publique 
 
Pour enrayer les dynamiques cumulatives et déstabilisantes, un ensemble d’actions 
complémentaires s’impose. 
 
Premièrement, il est essentiel de stabiliser les marchés obligataires européens. Nous devons 
admettre que le degré requis d’ajustement budgétaire est fortement dépendant du niveau de 
confiance des marchés. Ce facteur a été bien intégré par la France, avec son récent programme 
de consolidation budgétaire à hauteur de 18 milliards d’euros pour cette année et 2012, 
constitué notamment de réductions des avantages fiscaux, de relèvements de la TVA et d’une 
accélération de la réforme des retraites. Mais nous savons également que les marchés 
réagissent de manière positive, même si c’est de façon progressive, à un assainissement 
budgétaire et à une réforme financière crédibles. En témoigne la réussite du programme de 
consolidation en Irlande, où les écarts de rendement sont revenus de 14 % en juillet à environ 
8 % récemment. 
 
Deuxièmement, nous devons nous efforcer de dissocier le risque bancaire du risque souverain. 
À l’avenir, cela pourra appeler des solutions plus structurelles, telle qu’une garantie des 
dépôts et des mécanismes de résolution de crise fermement établis au niveau de la zone euro. 
 
Dans les circonstances actuelles d’instabilité, quel doit être le rôle de la banque centrale ? La 
politique monétaire doit sans aucun doute s’en tenir à son mandat et garantir la stabilité des 
prix à moyen terme. En Europe, compte tenu du durcissement des conditions financières lié à 
l’explosion des écarts de rendements souverains, de l’incertitude accrue et de la perte de 
confiance dont témoigne la chute de la plupart des indicateurs, des risques à la baisse accrus 
pèsent à présent sur la stabilité des prix. La décision, prise à l’unanimité par le Conseil des 
gouverneurs, d’abaisser nos taux d’intérêt directeurs de 25 points de base était par conséquent 
appropriée. 
 
Par ailleurs, nous devons assurer l'accès à la liquidité du système bancaire (ce que l’on appelle 
parfois le rôle de prêteur en dernier ressort de la banque centrale). À cet égard, l’Eurosystème 
a confirmé qu’il poursuivrait sa politique d’apport de liquidité au système bancaire en quantité 
illimitée et à taux fixe, au moins jusqu’à la fin du deuxième trimestre 2012. La politique en 
matière de garanties a été ajustée de manière à éviter les chocs et les pénuries de liquidité 
résultant des modifications des notations. Les financements en dollars, fondés sur l’accord de 
swap mis en place avec le Système fédéral de réserve, ont également été facilités. 
 
Enfin, en cette période de très fortes perturbations sur les marchés, il est primordial de 
garantir le fonctionnement effectif du mécanisme de transmission de la politique monétaire, 
en recourant, le cas échéant, à des interventions temporaires et exceptionnelles sur les 
compartiments des marchés où les dysfonctionnements sont les plus manifestes. Telle est la 
finalité du Programme pour les marchés de titres (Securities Market Programme - SMP) lancé 
par l’Eurosystème en mai 2010. Il est important de noter que dans notre cas, l’objectif n’était 
pas d’accroître la base monétaire, la monnaie de banque centrale créée par ces achats de titres 
ayant été stérilisée. 
 
Ce programme d’achats d’obligations a fait l’objet de critiques. Or, selon moi, il est 
totalement justifié par notre mandat. Confrontée à un risque clair de blocage des marchés 
financiers, et compte tenu des écarts très importants entre les taux d’intérêt sur les marchés du 
crédit, la BCE courait le risque de ne pas être en mesure de mettre en œuvre une politique 
monétaire véritablement unique, ni de respecter sa mission principale, qui est de maintenir la 
stabilité des prix à moyen terme dans l’ensemble de la zone euro. 
 
Des voix se sont élevées pour réclamer davantage de la part de la BCE. Les marchés et 
certains gouvernements semblent estimer que celle-ci devrait adopter une attitude plus 
volontariste en achetant de la dette publique. Permettez-moi de vous livrer quelques réflexions 
sur cette question. 
 
Dans certains pays, des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles ont conduit les banques 
centrales à acheter des montants considérables de dette publique - ces achats représentent 58% 
de la dette totale émise depuis 2009 au Royaume-Uni, 21 % aux États-Unis et entre 9 et 10% 
dans la zone euro - (un objectif de politique monétaire avait été défini dans tous les cas). 
 
Même si cela n’était pas son but premier, cette orientation a contribué à donner aux marchés 
une assurance, ou même une garantie, contre un éventuel assèchement de la liquidité. Dans 
tous les pays où les autorités monétaires ont acheté d’importants montants de dette, les taux 
d’intérêt à long terme ont été maintenus à des niveaux très faibles, indépendamment de la 
situation budgétaire nationale. Mais cet équilibre pourrait être instable dans un environnement 
d’inflation différent. En effet, les marchés semblent être conscients de certains « risques de 
perte extrême » liés à l’inflation et s’en protègent par l’achat d’or et de francs suisses, dont les 
cours ont atteint des records historiques. 
 
Dans la zone euro, nous estimons que toute réponse durable doit provenir des gouvernements. 
C’est pour cette raison que nous avons demandé une mise en œuvre rapide et une plus grande 
flexibilité pour le FESF et que nous avons accueilli très favorablement les décisions prises à 
cet égard en juillet et octobre. 
 
À ce stade, la zone euro paie un double tribut : l’un pour ses erreurs et l’autre pour sa vertu. 
L’erreur, de la part des gouvernements, a été d’autoriser pendant une décennie l’accumulation 
de la dette par le biais de politiques budgétaires insoutenables, et ensuite de créer ex nihilo un 
doute sur leur volonté de rembourser cette dette. Et nous payons également pour notre vertu et 
notre refus de rendre notre dette publique liquide par une monétisation massive de nos déficits 
budgétaires. 
 
Je pense que la vertu finira par être récompensée. Au cours de la prochaine décennie, les 
marchés et les prêteurs feront confiance aux monnaies qui, quelles que soient les 
circonstances, sont gérées en fonction d’une priorité essentielle : préserver la stabilité des prix 
et la valeur intrinsèque de la monnaie. Pour cette raison fondamentale, nous pouvons 
envisager l’avenir de l’euro avec un optimisme solide et réaliste. À mes yeux, la récente 
décision de la Banque nationale suisse d’ancrer le franc suisse à l’euro en est la confirmation. 
 
Conclusion 
 
L’histoire nous a enseigné que les crises financières peuvent être extrêmement violentes. Les 
perturbations qui touchent actuellement l’Europe ne font pas exception. Dans les phases les 
plus intenses, il est difficile d’imaginer qu’il y a une lumière au bout du tunnel. Mais l’histoire 
nous a également appris que les crises créent des opportunités de réformes et de progrès. Nous 
vivons dans des démocraties et devons accepter que les décisions politiques suivent leur cours 
et obéissent à leurs propres contraintes. Je suis persuadé que la zone euro sortira de cette 
période plus forte et avec une plus grande cohésion.  
 
Il y a, en effet, de bonnes raisons d’être optimiste. Du côté de l’offre, nos économies sont 
robustes et dynamiques. Les bilans des entreprises sont très solides. Notre système bancaire 
est robuste et fait l’objet d’une surveillance appropriée. Les économies émergentes réunissent 
les conditions nécessaires pour bénéficier d’une croissance soutenue et durable au cours des 
années à venir, contribuant ainsi à la demande mondiale. Surtout, la communauté des nations 
semble prête à faire face aux défis extraordinaires auxquels nous sommes confrontés.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
« L’orthodoxie des banques centrales à l’épreuve d’une période non 
orthodoxe » 
 
Global Interdependence Center 2012 
 
Paris, 26 Mars 2012 
 
Les politiques non-conventionnelles mises en œuvre pendant la crise ont transformé l’activité de 
banque centrale. Ces changements s’avèreront-ils permanents ; le non conventionnel deviendra-t-il la 
nouvelle norme ? Il est trop tôt pour apporter une réponse définitive à ces questions.  
Le retour au statu quo antérieur pourrait être moins aisé que nous le souhaiterions. Toutefois, je crois 
fermement que nous devons préserver les acquis de la période qui a précédé la crise, en termes de 
stabilité monétaire et de stabilité des prix.  
 
*** 
 
Avant la crise, une description des banques centrales aurait mis en évidence quatre caractéristiques :  
- Elles étaient centrées sur un objectif précis : la stabilité des prix, et ne recherchaient ou n’exerçaient 
pas de responsabilité particulière en matière de stabilité financière ;  
- Elles étaient soumises à des limites : leurs bilans étaient de taille très réduite et les taux d’intérêt 
constituaient leur unique instrument;  
- Elles étaient indépendantes, condition reconnue comme nécessaire à l’ancrage des anticipations 
d’inflation, et incarnée par des cadres institutionnels très solides ;  
- Et elles étaient efficaces : la « Grande modération », période de volatilité exceptionnellement faible 
de la production et de l’inflation, a été largement considérée comme le fruit de politiques monétaires 
efficaces et avisées. 
Nous avions le sentiment d’avoir enfin trouvé un régime monétaire pérenne et en adéquation avec les 
caractéristiques d’une économie de marché moderne. Les marchés financiers semblaient efficients et 
la borne zéro des taux d'intérêt ainsi que la trappe à liquidité apparaissaient comme de pures curiosités 
historiques.  
 
Avec le recul, nous voyons bien aujourd’hui que cette économie « idéale » n’a sans doute jamais 
existé. La « Grande modération » a probablement été tout autant le résultat d’une « bonne fortune » 
(découlant des effets désinflationnistes de la mondialisation) que d’une « bonne politique ». Nous 
savons que la stabilité monétaire est une condition nécessaire, mais pas suffisante, de la stabilité 
financière, car les marchés de capitaux ne sont pas toujours et pas nécessairement efficients. 
L’efficacité de l’instrument du taux d’intérêt peut par ailleurs être rapidement annulée par des spirales 
financières négatives.   
 
Par conséquent, les banques centrales ont répondu à la crise par des mesures sans précédent et, ce 
faisant, ont connu trois changements majeurs : 
2 
 
 
- Une diversification de leurs interventions. Avec deux objectifs : i) débloquer les marchés financiers 
(tant privés que publics) grâce à une fourniture exceptionnelle de liquidité aux banques et/ou des 
achats temporaires d’actifs, privés et publics ;  ii) contourner la borne zéro des taux d’intérêt et faire 
baisser les taux d’intérêt réels à long terme par des achats d’obligations d’État, et/ou par l’orientation 
des taux d’intérêt.  
 
- En conséquence, la taille des bilans des banques centrales a triplé, ce qui a considérablement accru 
leur rôle dans l’intermédiation financière et a pu faire naître des inquiétudes, du moins chez certains, 
quant à d’éventuelles retombées inflationnistes.  
- L’effet conjugué de la diversification des interventions et de l’augmentation de la taille des bilans a 
créé des interactions plus complexes avec les politiques budgétaires. En particulier, les achats 
d’actifs sont parfois considérés comme des mesures « quasi-budgétaires » tant du côté de l’actif (en 
raison des risques potentiels qu’ils comportent) que du passif (lorsqu’ils représentent une contribution 
significative aux besoins de financement des emprunteurs souverains).  
 
Au moment où elles ont été décidées, ces interventions exceptionnelles étaient absolument nécessaires. 
On l’oublie peut-être parfois, mais les banques centrales ont initialement été créées pour protéger 
l’économie des perturbations financières excessives. Il s’agit historiquement de leur « raison d’être ». 
En tant qu’uniques et ultimes fournisseurs de liquidité, elles ne peuvent se soustraire à leur 
responsabilité dans ce domaine et laisser s’effondrer le système financier et l’économie.  
 
En même temps, en agissant de la sorte, les banques centrales se sont exposées à un certain nombre de 
risques.  
Premièrement, aux risques liés à l’expansion de leur bilan. On ne peut les ignorer, même si toutes 
les banques centrales ont fait preuve d’une extrême prudence dans l’évaluation des actifs qu’elles ont 
acquis ou pris en garantie.  
Deuxièmement, elles se sont exposées au risque de brouiller la limite entre responsabilité 
budgétaire et responsabilité monétaire. L’utilisation dynamique par les banques centrales de leur 
bilan a une incidence sur l’allocation et la distribution des ressources au sein de l’économie. Elle peut 
favoriser ou pénaliser certains types de garanties ou d’emprunteurs. Par ailleurs, si les banques 
centrales prennent des responsabilités supplémentaires dans le domaine de la stabilité financière, elles 
devront le faire en étroite coopération avec les autorités budgétaires, s’exposant par là même à 
d’éventuelles interférences avec la politique monétaire.  
Le risque majeur, cependant, est le risque de confusion. Une multiplicité des interventions pourrait 
être interprétée comme une dilution des objectifs. Les intervenants de marché et certains responsables 
politiques ont tendance à considérer les banques centrales comme des entités omnipotentes, dont les 
bilans peuvent être utilisés, sans coût, et à toutes les fins. Il existe également un doute, tout au moins 
une ambiguïté, dans l’esprit de certains analystes, concernant le véritable objectif des achats 
d’obligations d’État. L’activisme des banques centrales peut créer des doutes quant à leur capacité à 
assurer le cœur de leur mandat, la stabilité des prix, face à des pressions et à des contraintes 
croissantes.  
 
Dans l’ensemble, la zone euro est bien protégée contre tous ces risques grâce à la robustesse de son 
cadre institutionnel :  
- La stabilité des prix constitue, sans aucune ambiguïté, l’objectif prioritaire de la politique monétaire ;  
- Le financement monétaire des États est strictement interdit ;  
- L’Eurosystème (la BCE et les banques centrales nationales) est extrêmement bien capitalisé, ce qui 
préserve son indépendance.  
C’est ce cadre robuste qui a permis à l’Eurosystème de mettre en œuvre des mesures non-
conventionnelles à grande échelle, sans risque pour sa crédibilité. 
 
Bien évidemment, nous ne contrôlons pas la politique budgétaire. Nous n’accepterons jamais une 
situation dans laquelle les déséquilibres budgétaires pourraient exercer une contrainte sur la politique 
monétaire. Par conséquent, il est très important qu’un redressement budgétaire crédible soit mis en 
3 
 
œuvre dans l’ensemble de la zone euro. L’Eurosystème pourra alors plus facilement agir pour protéger 
la stabilité financière. A l’inverse, des doutes quant à la résolution des gouvernements à garantir la 
soutenabilité des finances publiques nous rendraient impuissants à lutter contre l’instabilité et 
exposeraient la zone euro à de grands dangers.  
 
Concernant, à présent, les aspects plus normatifs. Nous devrons peut-être vivre avec les mesures non-
conventionnelles pendant longtemps. Par exemple, certaines banques centrales ont donné leurs 
orientations de taux d’intérêt pour les deux prochaines années. Il est en outre probable que la politique 
monétaire ait recours, durant un certain temps, à une diversité d’instruments. Les mesures macro-
prudentielles interagiront de manière complexe avec les politiques monétaires.  
Dans ce contexte, il est donc particulièrement important de conserver des objectifs clairs et de 
respecter deux caractéristiques fondamentales, héritées du consensus antérieur à la crise : la priorité 
accordée à la stabilité des prix et son corollaire, l’indépendance de la banque centrale. Il ne doit y 
avoir aucune ambiguïté sur ce que les banques centrales tentent de réaliser. Plus leurs mesures sont 
non-conventionnelles, plus leur objectif ultime doit être clair.  
Les mesures non-conventionnelles, comme toutes les autres, ne peuvent atteindre leur objectif 
que si les anticipations d’inflation sont solidement ancrées. À cet égard, les appels de certains 
économistes et intervenants de marché en faveur d’un assouplissement temporaire des 
objectifs de stabilité des prix sont, à mon sens, complètement erronés. Au contraire, il est 
significatif que deux grandes banques centrales aient récemment décidé de quantifier leurs 
objectifs de stabilité des prix et d’améliorer leur communication en conséquence.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Assemblée générale de l’ASF 
 13 juin 2012 
 
 
Je suis très honoré d’intervenir à cette nouvelle Assemblée générale de l’Association française des 
sociétés financières (ASF). Je me prête d’autant plus volontiers à cet exercice qu’il me donne 
l’occasion de vous présenter les actions et les positions de l’Autorité de Contrôle prudentiel (ACP) et 
de la Banque de France, et ce dans un environnement règlementaire appelé à connaître très rapidement 
des évolutions majeures. 
 
Je centrerai à cet égard mon intervention sur les évolutions attendues dans le cadre de la CRD IV mais 
aborderai également les enjeux autour de la protection du consommateur, sujets qui, tous deux, j’en 
suis conscient, représentent un enjeu important pour les membres de l’ASF. 
 
1) Les évolutions réglementaires liées à la CRD IV  
 
Comme vous le savez, la réforme européenne dite CRD IV  est entrée dans sa dernière phase de 
négociation avec la publication mi-mai des positions du Conseil ECOFIN et de la Commission des 
affaires économiques et monétaires (ECON) du Parlement européen. Elle devrait être stabilisée à l’été 
2012, pour une entrée en vigueur à ce stade fixée au 1er janvier 2013.  
 
Cette réforme vise avant tout à intégrer en droit européen la réforme prudentielle du Comité de Bâle 
(« Bâle 3 »). Elle a aussi un autre objectif majeur : l’harmonisation effective des normes de gestion, à 
même de permettre d’assurer aux établissements de crédit d’être soumis aux mêmes règles quel que 
soit leur pays d’implantation dans l’Union européenne. Cela ne doit bien sûr pas interdire toute 
flexibilité nationale, pour autant que celle-ci soit fortement encadrée ; c’est un point sur lequel nous 
devons être très vigilants dans le cadre du « trilogue » en cours.  
 
En pratique toutefois, l’harmonisation maximale va imposer de soumettre tous les établissements de 
crédit aux futures normes de liquidité, même si elles ne sont clairement pas adaptées à tous les 
établissements spécialisés, notamment à ceux qui n’ont pas d’activité significative de collecte de 
dépôts. L’harmonisation maximale implique aussi l’exercice des deux activités, de réception de fonds 
remboursables du public et d’octroi de crédit, tels que prévus pour l’agrément en qualité 
d’établissement de crédit. .  
 
Au plan purement juridique, l’agrément des sociétés financières françaises présente bien ces deux 
dimensions, puisqu’elles peuvent recevoir des fonds du public à titre accessoire. Cet agrément n’est 
   
2 
 
donc pas en droit remis en cause par l’entrée en vigueur du futur régime, mais au vu des contraintes 
qu’il va imposer, il pourrait s’avérer inadapté.  Il me semble donc souhaitable, conformément au droit 
européen, d’introduire en France un statut particulier, comme il existe déjà dans d’autres États 
membres, pour des sociétés qui souhaiteraient se spécialiser dans certains types d’activité de crédit, 
sans avoir à recueillir des dépôts ni à respecter alors les nouvelles règles de liquidité. Les membres de 
l’ASF pourraient alors choisir entre deux options, en fonction des contours qui seront arrêtés pour ce 
statut :  
- soit  ils demeureraient établissement de crédit et seraient dès lors soumis d’office aux 
normes CRD IV ; 
- soit ils renonceraient au statut d’établissement de crédit et  demanderaient à bénéficier du 
nouveau statut. 
Dans le premier cas, je rappelle que la notion de réception de fonds remboursables du public 
comprendrait, selon le projet de directive CRD IV, le produit de l’émission continue d’obligations ou 
de titres équivalents. Cela permet donc de recevoir des fonds du public autres que les dépôts des 
particuliers.  
Dans le second cas,  se pose la question des contours du  régime prudentiel qui serait mis en place 
pour ces établissements spécialisés.  
 
Sur cette question, complexe et multidimensionnelle, qui a donné lieu à d’intenses réflexions au cours 
de ces derniers mois, entre vos adhérents, la Direction générale du Trésor et mes services, les choix 
définitifs sont naturellement du ressort du Ministre de l’économie, des finances et du commerce 
extérieur. Ces choix sont par ailleurs tributaires de l’issue du « trilogue ».   
 
Je me limiterai donc seulement à faire part de pistes de réflexion préliminaires du point de vue de 
l’ACP et de la Banque de France. 
 
De manière générale, l’éventualité, pour les établissements qui développent une importante activité de 
crédit ne plus se voir appliquer de réglementation prudentielle et sortir du champ de contrôle de l’ACP 
me paraît totalement exclue. L’approche française ayant prévalu jusqu’à présent a fait ses preuves et la 
remettre en cause n’irait pas de soi, surtout dans un contexte marqué par l’intensification des 
réflexions sur la finance parallèle (le « shadow banking »), au plan international et européen - comme 
en atteste la récente publication du Livre vert de la Commission.    
 
En revanche, la question de savoir quel corpus réglementaire serait à appliquer est plus ouverte. 
Plusieurs aspects doivent, à mon sens, être pris en considération, parmi lesquels : la  préservation de la 
stabilité financière, la protection de la clientèle et l’égalité des conditions de concurrence. c C’est un 
aspect auquel je suis très attentif, car il est fondamental de préserver la capacité du système financier 
français à financer l’économie.  
 
Autre point important, nous devons nous assurer de l’adéquation entre les futures règles qui seront in 
fine retenues et la nature des risques et des activités développées par les différentes catégories de 
sociétés financières. 
 
Ces éléments appellent  une solution équilibrée, proportionnée aux enjeux et adaptée aux différents 
modèles économiques des sociétés financières. Des régimes différenciés pourront donc paraître utiles 
en fonction notamment des enjeux pour la stabilité financière.   
 
Il me semble important, en toute hypothèse, que les éléments faisant la qualité des sociétés financières 
d’aujourd’hui soient le plus possible en phase avec les futures caractéristiques des entreprises qui, 
   
3 
 
demain, ne seront plus des établissements de crédit. Je pense ici notamment à la définition des fonds 
propres, aux approches applicables pour le risque de crédit et le risque opérationnel, ainsi que plus 
généralement à la gouvernance. 
 
Cela étant, nous le savons, il existe manifestement dans le projet CRD IV des exigences qui ne sont 
pas facilement applicables à des entreprises présentant un modèle économique différent de celui des 
établissements de crédit.  
 
J’ai déjà évoqué les  ratios de liquidité, celui à un mois, le LCR, et celui à un an, le NSFR. Eu égard 
notamment à l’absence de dépôts et à la nature des activités de crédit exercées, il n’est pas certain, loin 
s’en faut, que ces ratios constituent dans tous les cas la réponse réglementaire la plus appropriée. Dans 
certains cas, la solution d’un maintien des règles en vigueur en France me paraît devoir être explorée, 
sous réserve, comme je l’ai indiqué précédemment, que cela n’ait pas d’impact sur les conditions de 
concurrence.  
 
Au-delà de ces questions générales, certaines problématiques plus techniques, mais tout aussi 
importantes, doivent être prises en compte. Tel est le cas des sociétés de caution, qui pourraient, 
demain, ne plus être considérées comme établissements de crédit. Le sujet naturellement est celui de la 
reconnaissance en fonds propres des fonds de garantie. Le problème est connu et bien identifié : un 
fonds ne couvrant que le risque de crédit ne peut être assimilé à des fonds propres, lesquels sont par 
essence appelés à couvrir tous types de risques. Des propositions d’évolutions des fonds en place 
devaient être menées. Elles seront examinées avec soin. Ces fonds de garantie font aujourd’hui l’objet 
de reconnaissances prudentielles différentes selon leurs caractéristiques : la seule certitude à ce jour 
est qu’ils ne feront pas l’objet d’un traitement uniforme demain. Le statu quo n’est pas une option 
satisfaisante. L’objectif qui doit être poursuivi est clair : il faut améliorer la capacité d’absorption des 
pertes de ces fonds. C’est la condition pour améliorer, le cas échéant, leur prise en compte 
prudentielle.  
 
Je souhaiterais maintenant aborder le second point de mon intervention, la protection du 
consommateur.  
 
2) La protection du consommateur   
  
La crise financière a accru le besoin de protection du consommateur au sein de l'Union européenne et 
montré l'importance de la confiance réciproque que doivent s'accorder le client et sa banque pour le 
maintien de l'activité économique et la stabilité financière. Conçue dans cette orientation, la directive 
sur les contrats de crédit aux consommateurs de 2008, d'harmonisation maximale, a prévu des 
dispositions visant la publicité et l'information pré-contractuelle par les intermédiaires de crédit. Ces 
dispositions ont été reprises dans la loi Lagarde et complétées par différents textes réglementaires 
visant à définir et encadrer, d’une part, l'intermédiation en opérations de banque et, d’autre part, à 
donner les critères définissant les Intermédiaire en opérations de banque et services de paiement 
(IOBSP).  
 
Une réglementation plus claire et détaillée ne signifie pas des difficultés accrues dans son application. 
Les sociétés financières, qui ont recours, pour la commercialisation de leurs crédits, à des 
commerçants, des grandes chaînes de distribution ou à des vendeurs de matériel, savent en général 
avec qui elles travaillent. Elles suivent le chiffre d'affaires apporté par leurs intermédiaires et 
détectent, notamment au travers de l'examen de la qualité du dossier de crédit ou des réclamations, 
ceux d'entre eux qui posent un problème ou n'appliquent pas bien les bases de l'accord de partenariat. 
   
4 
 
Elles peuvent alors révoquer cet accord. Les commissions versées à ces intermédiaires sont un critère 
important dans le suivi des IOBSP par les sociétés financières qui les mandatent. 
 
L'entrée en relation avec la clientèle, la présentation des contrats de crédit, l'évaluation des 
connaissances et de l'expérience du client ainsi que de sa solvabilité sont des prestations qui 
participent directement à l'exécution des opérations de banque. Elles sont d'ailleurs quotidiennement 
pratiquées dans les agences bancaires. Les confier à un tiers de manière durable et à titre habituel 
revient bien évidemment à les externaliser au sens du règlement n°97-02. Lorsqu'elle établit un 
mandat de délégation à un IOBSP, la société financière demeure donc pleinement responsable du 
respect des obligations qui lui incombent.  
 
Intégrer l'intermédiation en opérations de banque et services de paiement dans le champ du contrôle 
interne de la société financière, ce n'est pas lui déléguer le contrôle effectué par l'ACP. C'est 
simplement signer un contrat écrit, s'assurer de la qualité et de la continuité du service rendu, de la 
protection des règles de confidentialité, du suivi des procédures définies par son établissement et 
pouvoir s'en rendre compte sur place. C’est l’intérêt bien compris de la société financière. Et que la 
nouvelle réglementation aboutisse à une clarification des rôles et des responsabilités de chacun ne peut 
avoir que des impacts positifs sur le fonctionnement du marché. 
 
L'ACP effectue ses propres contrôles de la bonne application de la réglementation et de ses propres 
recommandations. Elle entend bien les développer  dans les années qui viennent chez les IOBSP. Les 
IOBSP sont nombreux, certes, et l'ACP ne saurait les assujettir tous à son contrôle chaque année. 
Néanmoins, ses contrôles peuvent être ciblés grâce à son action de vérification de la publicité, 
d'exploitation des réclamations et à toutes les sources d'information à sa disposition. 
 
J'espère donc avoir dissipé vos doutes et vous avoir aussi rassurés sur l'utilité de cette nouvelle 
réglementation et sur les diligences qui incombent à vos établissements respectifs. 
 
* * * 
 
Au total, les membres de l’ASF, qui ont joué et continuent à jouer un rôle central dans le financement 
de l’économie française, vont être profondément impactés par la CRD IV, comme l’ensemble des 
établissements de crédit au demeurant.  
 
L’ampleur des changements dépendra des solutions qui seront finalement adoptées en termes de statut 
et de régimes prudentiels. A ce stade, le contour précis et définitif de ces derniers n’est pas connu, 
comme vous le constatez, mais j’espère avoir aujourd’hui contribué à apporter des clarifications sur ce 
qui, du point de vue de l’ACP et de la Banque de France, paraît devoir être pris en compte.  
 
Je ne doute toutefois pas que la mobilisation continue de l’ensemble des parties prenantes, profession 
et pouvoirs publics, permette de rapidement faire émerger une solution.

Conférence de l’ACP – 27 juin 2012 
Discours introductif de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Bâle 3 – CRD4 : Impacts et Enjeux 
 
Mesdames et messieurs,  
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui à cette nouvelle conférence de l’Autorité de 
contrôle prudentiel dédiée ce matin aux impacts et enjeux de la réforme de Bâle III et, cet après-midi, 
au contrôle des pratiques commerciales en assurance et en banque. Je tiens à remercier l’ensemble  des 
participants de l’intérêt qu’ils démontrent pour ces échanges indispensables entre régulateurs, 
superviseurs et acteurs de place. 
 
Cette conférence intervient dans un contexte économique et financier toujours très difficile, caractérisé 
en particulier en Europe par la persistance de la crise de la dette souveraine. De nombreuses questions 
entourent l’avenir du système bancaire européen, qui a déjà connu de profondes évolutions sur la 
période récente et alors que des changements majeurs de son cadre prudentiel et de l’organisation de 
sa supervision sont actuellement en discussion. Loin de reléguer au second plan les questions relatives 
à Bâle III et sa déclinaison européenne, la CRD IV et son projet de « single rule book » européen, ces 
développements me paraissent au contraire renforcer l’importance de bien comprendre la réforme en 
cours et de prendre le temps de la réflexion, afin de s’assurer que le nouveau socle de la 
réglementation bancaire et de la répartition des pouvoirs de supervision en Europe délivrera tous les 
bénéfices attendus.  
 
Avant de vous laisser discuter plus en détail des impacts et enjeux de la réforme bâloise, je 
souhaiterais vous faire part de quelques réflexions à ce sujet compte tenu de l’environnement actuel.  
 
1. Bâle III et CRD IV représente un saut quantitatif et qualitatif destiné à tirer les leçons de la 
crise financière en cours 
 
Tout d’abord, il me paraît utile de resituer rapidement la réforme de Bâle III dans son contexte, pour 
bien en apprécier la portée.  
 
Bâle III est avant tout une réponse à la crise financière qui a démarré en 2007. Cette crise et ses 
répliques bancaires qui se sont succédé depuis n’ont pas simplement abouti à une passagère perte de 
production pour les grandes économies développées. Elles ont des répercussions durables sur l’emploi, 
la production industrielle, la confiance des investisseurs et des ménages, sans oublier les finances 
publiques, qui rendent la sortie de crise d’autant plus difficile. Face à ces développements, la 
communauté internationale a adopté dès 2009, sous l’impulsion du G20, un programme de réforme 
ambitieux dont Bâle III représente l’élément clé pour le secteur bancaire. Un système bancaire plus 
robuste au plan global, capable d’absorber des chocs de grande magnitude, est en effet essentiel pour 
éviter la répétition de tels enchaînements à l’avenir. A cet égard, il est clair que l’Europe doit aller de 
l’avant, malgré le retard du calendrier des réformes aux Etats-Unis : il en va de la crédibilité de nos 
banques et de nos économies. 
 
Bâle III s’appuie bien entendu sur Bâle II qui définit les règles de solvabilité actuellement en vigueur. 
Pour autant, Bâle III est plus qu’une simple évolution et mise à jour des règles existantes.  
 
- Bâle III renforce certes fortement les exigences de solvabilité que doivent respecter les banques, 
mais cette réforme va plus loin en enrichissant sensiblement le dispositif prudentiel : aux 
exigences de solvabilité sont venues s’ajouter des exigences de liquidité et l’introduction d’un 
ratio de levier est envisagée à moyen terme. Bâle III est de ce point de vue une réforme globale de 
la réglementation bancaire. 
 
- Bâle III marque aussi et surtout à mon sens une avancée majeure dans la mesure où cette réforme 
conduit à une interaction beaucoup plus grande que jusqu’à présent entre surveillance individuelle 
des établissements de crédit, ce qu’on appelle aussi la surveillance microprudentielle, et 
surveillance globale du système bancaire et financier, ou surveillance macroprudentielle. Cette 
vision élargie de la surveillance bancaire, prenant en compte toutes ses facettes, se matérialise par 
un certain nombre de dispositions parmi lesquelles je retiendrai tout particulièrement 
l’introduction de différents coussins de fonds propres (coussin de conservation, coussin 
contracyclique et coussin pour les banques systémiques) au-delà du minimum réglementaire.  
 
Bâle 3 représente ainsi un saut quantitatif mais aussi qualitatif. Compte tenu de l’ampleur des 
changements à mettre en œuvre, Bâle III a des répercussions majeures sur les acteurs du système 
financier, qui doivent s’adapter à ce nouvel environnement. Ces répercussions sont souhaitables et 
attendues, mais il convient aussi d’en limiter les conséquences potentiellement négatives. A cet égard, 
de nombreux risques liés à cette réforme ont été évoqués lors de son développement et plus encore 
récemment, compte tenu du contexte économique et financier difficile que nous connaissons, parmi 
lesquels en particulier un risque de renchérissement du coût du crédit ou bien de rationnement du 
crédit. La question des impacts et des enjeux de Bâle III nécessite donc pleinement d’être traitée et 
analysée dans le détail.  
 
2. Le contexte économique difficile ne fait que souligner l’importance des conditions de la mise 
en œuvre de Bâle III mais ne remet pas en cause le bien-fondé de la réforme  
 
Sans minimiser les risques potentiels associés au passage à Bâle III, éléments auxquels l’Autorité de 
contrôle prudentiel est particulièrement vigilante, je pense qu’un passage réussi à Bâle III est tout à fait 
possible. Permettez-moi d’évoquer quelques indices qui me donnent cette conviction et quelques 
pistes d’actions : 
 
- Tout d’abord, les banques françaises, qui satisfont déjà aux règles de Bâle 2.5 depuis décembre 
2011, sont en bonne position pour respecter les nouvelles exigences de fonds propres, une fois 
celles-ci en vigueur. Les banques françaises se conforment d’ailleurs plus rapidement que ne 
l’exige le calendrier de Bâle aux nouvelles exigences en fonds propres. Avec aujourd’hui des 
ratios de fonds propres de Core Tier one supérieurs à 9 %, les grands groupes français confirment 
leur capacité à remplir les objectifs fixés au 30 juin 2012 par l’Autorité bancaire européenne 
(ABE). Ils devraient également dès 2013 se conformer pleinement aux nouvelles exigences de 
Bâle III.  
 
- L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel a mis en place un suivi rapproché des établissements, afin de 
suivre leur préparation à Bâle III. Ce suivi rapproché, qui permet d’identifier en amont les 
éventuels problèmes et de traiter les questions liées à la mise en œuvre, me paraît essentiel pour 
une transition réussie. Plus généralement, au-delà du suivi individuel de la préparation des 
établissements, des échanges entre les superviseurs et les acteurs concernés sont également 
importants, pour s’assurer d’une bonne compréhension des règles, identifier les éventuelles 
questions liés à la réforme ainsi que ses conséquences. L’ACP a de nombreux échanges avec la 
profession sur tous les sujets prudentiels. La conférence d’aujourd’hui l’illustre d’ailleurs et rentre 
à mon sens, pleinement dans ce cadre. 
 
- Un autre élément essentiel est de bien suivre et prendre en compte l’impact des nouvelles 
réglementations sur le système financier et l’économie et d’apprécier les différentes interactions, 
pour si besoin, traiter des conséquences non anticipées de Bâle III. A cet égard, L’ACP, grâce à 
son adossement et ses liens étroits avec la Banque de France, est très naturellement 
particulièrement attentive et impliquée sur ces questions. C’est pour cette raison que nous 
accompagnons la réforme prudentielle de réflexions plus globales et macroéconomiques sur le 
financement de l’économie, et notamment l’évolution des crédits ou l’articulation de la 
règlementation bancaire avec la politique monétaire. Les nouveaux ratios de liquidité ne sauraient 
ainsi être appliqués en l’état car ils ne prennent pas en compte toutes leurs conséquences et 
interactions au-delà des seuls objectifs prudentiels, ce qui comprend en particulier le 
fonctionnement du marché interbancaire, le niveau d’intermédiation ou bien les conditions 
d’exercice de la politique monétaire. Les travaux en cours sur les différents paramètres de ces 
ratios me paraissent donc tout  particulièrement nécessaires afin de bien maîtriser les 
conséquences, dans leur ensemble, des nouvelles règles.

Avant de donner la parole à Danièle Nouy, Secrétaire général de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel, je 
souhaiterais conclure avec quelques mots sur les récents développements au plan européen. Vous 
connaissez mon engagement en faveur d’une harmonisation maximale en Europe : ce « livre unique » 
seul à même de donner toute son efficacité au marché unique. Vous savez aussi combien les 
négociations entre le Conseil et le Parlement européens risquent de réintroduire les options nationales 
que la Commission avait supprimées. Elles pourraient aussi, dans le cadre d’un texte de compromis, 
rendre en partie redondantes et inefficaces les responsabilités des superviseurs des Etats d’origine et 
d’accueil, mais aussi celles des superviseurs micro-prudentiels et macro-prudentiels. Dans ce contexte, 
la création d’une Union bancaire paraît devoir être encouragée. Il s’agirait là d’un développement 
majeur pour la supervision bancaire en Europe, qui apporterait de nombreux bénéfices et permettrait 
de répondre efficacement aux difficultés actuelles. Une telle évolution, pour le sujet qui nous intéresse 
aujourd’hui, aurait vraisemblablement des conséquences très positives en accentuant l’harmonisation 
européenne. Naturellement, les bénéfices d’une telle réforme iraient au-delà mais il s’agit là de 
questions qui dépassent le thème de notre journée. Les questions liées aux impacts et enjeux de Bâle 
III me paraissent déjà largement suffisantes pour alimenter de riches débats et discussions ce matin. 
 
Je vous souhaite une très bonne conférence.

Colloque du 5 octobre 2012 « Regards croisés sur 40 ans de Zone franc » 
Discours de clôture par M. Noyer,  
 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Messieurs les Ministres,  
Messieurs les Gouverneurs, 
Chers collègues et amis, 
 
C’est un très grand honneur que vous m’avez fait en m’invitant à prononcer le discours de 
clôture du 40ème anniversaire des accords de coopération monétaire de la Zone franc, qui ont 
consolidé un système qui existe en réalité depuis beaucoup plus longtemps.  
 
Sans prétendre synthétiser ces débats, je voudrais retenir trois idées, importantes à mes yeux 
et caractéristiques, je le pense, du système de la Zone franc qui est à la fois efficace, robuste et 
moderne :  
 
1) C’est un système efficace au regard de son objectif : garantir la stabilité des prix. Il faut en 
effet rappeler avec force ce que la Zone franc apporte depuis plus de 50 ans aux pays 
membres : une stabilité des prix particulièrement remarquable pour des pays en 
développement, par exemple si l’on compare ce résultat au reste de l’Afrique sub-saharienne. 
Cet avantage comparatif s’est maintenu sur la période la plus récente, cette faible inflation 
préservant le pouvoir d’achat des populations. La stabilité des prix est largement due au taux 
de change fixe vis-à-vis de l’euro. Stabilité des prix et fixité des changes permettent par 
ailleurs de disposer d’un environnement sécurisant pour les opérateurs économiques, 
favorisant les investissements et la conduite des politiques économiques et de réformes 
structurelles. Il a souvent été reproché à la fixité du taux de change d’être susceptible 
d’entraîner une surévaluation de la monnaie, qui handicaperait la croissance. Or, en matière 
de croissance, les performances de la Zone franc sur longue période n’ont rien à envier à 
celles de la plupart des autres pays africains.  
 
2 
La Zone franc a aussi été un cadre favorisant progressivement une amélioration des politiques 
économiques, notamment budgétaires. D’une part, la mise en œuvre de la limitation du 
financement monétaire des États, qui est une des règles de base de ces unions, crée une 
contrainte forte et salutaire pour les budgets des États. D’autre part, à partir du milieu des 
années 1990, l’exercice de surveillance multilatérale a incité à une plus grande discipline dans 
la gestion des finances publiques. Les efforts entrepris dans la formulation et la conduite des 
politiques économiques doivent naturellement se poursuivre et le dispositif de surveillance 
multilatérale se renforcer.  
 
2) C’est aussi un système extraordinairement robuste, qui est le système de changes fixes le 
plus ancien du monde. Il a résisté à des changements drastiques de contexte : aux 
indépendances, à l’éclatement du système de Bretton-Woods, à la libéralisation des échanges 
comme à l’intégration de la France dans l’union monétaire européenne. Il a aussi résisté à une 
incroyable succession de chocs, tant politiques qu’économiques et sociaux. Les crises 
politiques et sociales traversées au cours de ces dernières années par la Centrafrique, le 
Tchad, le Togo, le Congo ou plus récemment la Côte d’Ivoire ont à cet égard parfaitement 
illustré le rôle stabilisateur que jouent les mécanismes de la Zone franc. Dans ces périodes de 
troubles extrêmement graves, ces mécanismes ont permis de préserver la crédibilité et la 
valeur de la monnaie et ont joué un rôle de protection efficace en évitant la propagation de la 
crise et une hyperinflation ou une dollarisation qui l’aurait aggravée. De même, dans des pays 
très vulnérables à l’évolution des cours des matières premières, l’ancrage des francs CFA et 
comorien assure une protection face aux chocs externes, notamment pour en éviter les effets 
de second tour qui auraient pu être engendrés par la dépréciation du taux de change de la 
monnaie nationale. Ainsi, lors des multiples crises alimentaires provoquées par la sécheresse 
ou d’autres calamités naturelles ou lorsque les cours des matières premières ont connu une 
nette hausse en 2008 et à nouveau en 2011, l’ancrage apporté par le système de la Zone franc 
a aidé à limiter la hausse des prix des importations alimentaires et énergétiques des pays 
membres. 
  
Malgré les interrogations, les critiques aussi, que peut susciter parfois la Zone franc, il faut 
donc reconnaître et souligner la faculté qu’a ce système à surmonter les épreuves et les crises 
qui n’ont pas manqué au cours des décennies passées.  
 
Si ce système a résisté à tant de changements, ce n’est pas parce qu’il s’est adapté mais parce 
qu’il est par nature adapté à des contextes très différents. Ni ses principes, ni même ses 
mécanismes fondamentaux n’ont changé parce que c’est une construction pragmatique fondée 
3 
sur des principes et des règles simples : un taux de changes fixe, une garantie de convertibilité 
illimitée et un garant extérieur crédible. L’attachement de l’ensemble des parties à ces règles 
et à ces principes en a assuré la robustesse, lors de changements drastiques de la situation 
politique ou économique ou dans des situations de crise parfois aigües. La dévaluation de 
1994 a aussi montré que ce système pouvait intégrer un ajustement quand cela était 
nécessaire. Il faut également tenir compte du facteur humain. Comme l’ont souligné tous les 
participants, la Zone franc a tissé des relations humaines très solides. C’est aussi l’étroitesse et 
la profondeur de ces liens qui ont permis à ce système de faire preuve d’une grande capacité 
de résistance dans des contextes instables ou incertains. 
 
3) Enfin, le système de la Zone franc est un système résolument moderne. Si certains ont pu 
juger ou plutôt « préjuger » qu’il s’agissait d’une relique coloniale, il m’apparaît bien au 
contraire comme le précurseur des dispositifs de pare feux régionaux que nous cherchons 
aujourd’hui précisément à promouvoir, notamment en zone euro. La garantie donnée par 
l’État français permet, en effet, à chaque zone monétaire de faire face à un choc de balance 
des paiements tel qu’il épuiserait les réserves de changes. L’ouverture dans ce cas d’un crédit 
illimité sur le compte d’opérations permet de continuer à financer les dépenses extérieures 
indispensables. En contrepartie, les autorités monétaires doivent prendre les dispositions 
nécessaires pour reconstituer les réserves de changes. Associés à la centralisation des recettes 
d’exportation, ces mécanismes fonctionnent donc comme un « filet de sécurité financière », 
permettant de protéger les économies de choc de balance des paiements.  
 
Voici les trois principaux enseignements que m’inspirent les échanges auxquels nous venons 
d’assister et qui nous ont également donné la mesure de l’intérêt de l’histoire de la Zone franc. 
A cet égard, il m’a semblé, notamment en parcourant l’ouvrage commémoratif des 40 ans de 
la Zone franc que la Banque de France publie aujourd’hui avec la Direction générale du 
Trésor, que si certains épisodes de cette histoire nous sont bien connus, d’autres pans de celle-
ci mériteraient certainement d’être davantage explorés. C’est pourquoi la Banque de France a 
souhaité engager un programme de recherche sur l’histoire de la Zone franc, qui a vocation à 
associer toutes les parties intéressées, je pense en particulier aux banques centrales de la Zone 
franc, mais aussi aux universités, aux centres de recherche et institutions de développement, 
en France et en Afrique.   
 
Pour conclure, même un système efficace, robuste et moderne ne peut, à lui seul, résoudre 
tous les problèmes et assurer aux pays qui en bénéficient de réussir leur développement à long 
terme. A cet égard, les mécanismes de coopération monétaire de la Zone franc gagneraient, à 
4 
mon sens, à être complétés par trois piliers : (i) comme je l’ai évoqué, les unions monétaires 
doivent être consolidées par une surveillance multilatérale plus étroite des politiques 
économiques, notamment budgétaires, et l’exemple de la zone euro le montre amplement ; (ii) 
la mise en œuvre de réformes structurelles, portant notamment sur l’amélioration de 
l’environnement des affaires et la gestion des entreprises publiques, est certainement 
indispensable pour rehausser le potentiel de croissance des économies de la Zone franc et 
contribuer à l’amélioration de leur compétitivité, sachant que la fixité du change ne permet 
pas de se laisser aller à la facilité des dévaluations ; (iii) l’approfondissement de l’intégration 
économique et financière régionale dans la Zone franc est, enfin, un enjeu majeur à moyen et 
à long termes et ce plus encore qu’en zone euro, car elle engendre des effets d’échelle 
indispensables pour l’intégration dans l’économie mondiale.  
 
Les cinquante dernières années ont montré que la Zone franc était un facteur favorable au 
développement. Ce n’en a été cependant, ni une condition nécessaire, ni, a fortiori, une 
condition suffisante. Les bonnes performances économiques d’autres pays en Afrique le 
montrent. La pérennité de la Zone franc dépendra donc de la dynamique du modèle de 
développement choisi par les États membres et de la volonté du partenaire français 
d’accompagner ce développement. Je ne doute ni de l’un, ni de l’autre.

The Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan 
Tokyo, 10 octobre 2012 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
Les défis auxquels la zone euro doit encore faire face 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je souhaite tout d’abord remercier le Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan 
pour son invitation qui me donne le plaisir d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui et de 
m’exprimer, ici à Tokyo devant des observateurs de différents horizons sur la 
situation dans la zone euro.  
La zone euro traverse une crise importante depuis plusieurs années. Cette 
crise a des ressorts multiples qui interrogent les fondements institutionnels de 
l’union monétaire.  
Je souhaite partager aujourd’hui avec vous ma ferme conviction que les 
différentes racines de la crise sont aujourd’hui bien analysées et qu’elles sont 
en train d’être traitées efficacement. Le principal défi auquel doit faire face la 
zone euro est la poursuite des efforts engagés pour revenir à l’équilibre 
budgétaire, pour retrouver le chemin de la compétitivité et de la croissance et 
pour renforcer l’union économique et monétaire.  
 
 
1. Quelle est la situation en zone euro ? 
L’année 2012 avait commencé sous des auspices favorables. La confiance 
semblait pouvoir revenir progressivement, les décisions prises – et notamment 
les opérations de VLTRO – avaient rassuré. Néanmoins, les tensions se sont à 
nouveau vite accrues, notamment sous l’effet des difficultés grecques et 
espagnoles. Il est apparu clairement que la situation était encore fragile, et que 
les solutions apportées jusqu’ici dans la zone euro devaient encore être 
approfondies pour atteindre une amélioration véritablement durable. 
Actuellement, plusieurs signaux sont positifs : les émissions obligataires 
montrent un certain dynamisme ; les taux des pays périphériques se sont 
quelque peu détendus ; les indices boursiers sont remontés.  
Mais il persiste en particulier deux points de faiblesse importants :  
 les marchés financiers sont très segmentés à l’intérieur de la zone avec 
des différences de taux souverains très importantes ;  
 la croissance est faible, avec des disparités là aussi très importantes au 
sein de la zone. Au deuxième trimestre, la croissance a été négative pour la 
zone, à – 0,2%, après une stagnation au premier trimestre. L’Allemagne 
affichait le meilleur résultat avec une croissance de 0,3%, le Portugal fermait la 
marche avec - 1,2%. Nous prévoyons toujours un retour très progressif à la 
croissance pour l’année prochaine. 
Avant de se poser la question des solutions à ces problèmes, il faut bien 
analyser leurs causes.  
A mon sens, trois causes se sont renforcées mutuellement pour donner 
naissance à la crise en zone euro.  
1. La crise trouve sa principale origine dans le manque de discipline 
budgétaire de la plupart des pays membres. Alors que les pays avaient dû 
faire des efforts de redressement budgétaire importants pour remplir les 
critères de convergence et être autorisés à rentrer dans la zone, ils ont, pour 
la quasi-totalité d’entre eux, relâché la pression dès lors qu’ils y sont entrés. 
 
Pendant les dix premières années d’existence de la monnaie unique, ils ont 
accumulé des déficits et de la dette, y compris en période de croissance. Les 
pays sont donc arrivés en 2008, au début de la crise, sans aucune marge de 
manœuvre budgétaire et leurs finances publiques se sont très fortement 
dégradées.  
La discipline individuelle des États a donc été trop faible, et la discipline 
collective, pourtant prévue par le Pacte de Stabilité et de croissance, n’a pas 
été efficacement appliquée. Je veux vous rappeler l’esprit de ce Pacte. Il a été 
conçu comme le pilier budgétaire de l’union monétaire. Il reposait sur la 
surveillance par les pairs. Mais, d’une part, il a été volontairement mal 
interprété : alors qu’il recommandait aux pays d’être à l’équilibre budgétaire 
sur le cycle, sans dépasser les 3% de déficit annuel, les États l’ont interprété 
comme : « nous pouvons être en permanence à 3% de déficit ». Et d’autre 
part, il n’a pas été respecté, puisque les États qui dépassaient les limites 
fixées n’étaient pas sanctionnés (y compris la France et l’Allemagne aux 
alentours de 2002).  
2. La deuxième cause de la crise se trouve dans les écarts de compétitivité qui 
se sont creusés pendant une longue période avant la crise. Le raisonnement 
économique est facile à comprendre : lorsque vous rejoignez une zone 
monétaire qui a pour objectif un taux d’inflation juste inférieur à 2 %, les 
évolutions des coûts unitaires de production doivent être conformes à cet 
objectif fixé par la banque centrale, modulo les gains de productivité. Tous les 
pays qui n’ont pas respecté, année après année, ce calcul et cette discipline 
ont subi une perte de compétitivité, in fine très importante. 
Il faut dire aussi que, pour les dérapages budgétaires et de compétitivité, le 
marché n’a pas joué son rôle. Dès après l’adoption de l’euro, les marchés 
n’ont plus différencié les pays et les taux souverains se sont rapprochés, allant 
même jusqu’à s’égaliser sur les niveaux les plus bas, de l’Allemagne et de la 
France.  
 
Pendant les dix premières années de l’euro, tout se passait comme si la 
monnaie unique jouait un rôle de bouclier qui, en plus de protéger les pays 
contre l’instabilité monétaire, – ce que l’euro a parfaitement fait et ce pour quoi 
il a effectivement été créé – les protégeait aussi contre la réalité économique. 
Les États avaient l’illusion qu’ils pouvaient, sans en pâtir à aucun moment, se 
permettre de ne pas respecter les règles de discipline budgétaire ou de ne pas 
s’efforcer de rester compétitifs. La crise les a très violemment rappelés à 
l’ordre.  
3. La troisième cause de la crise, mêlée aux deux autres, est institutionnelle : 
l’union monétaire ne s’appuyait pas sur des institutions économiques, 
budgétaires, financières et politiques suffisamment robustes. Les mécanismes 
de discipline budgétaire étaient insuffisants, il n’existait pas de mécanisme de 
surveillance des déséquilibres, ni de mécanisme de gestion des crises ; l’union 
financière avait une réalité quand les choses allaient bien : les banques 
détenaient des obligations des autres États-membres, mais elle s'est 
fragmentée très rapidement au moment de la crise, par manque de solidité 
institutionnelle. 
2. Les causes de la crise sont en train d'être traitées 
Je souhaite vous montrer à présent que la zone euro apporte des réponses 
précisément aux trois causes fondamentales de la crise qui la touche.  
D'abord, sur le plan budgétaire. Les efforts déjà accomplis par les différents 
pays de la zone euro portent leurs fruits : le solde primaire de la zone euro 
devrait être proche de l'équilibre fin 2012, ce qui est une performance 
remarquable par rapport aux autres grandes zones économiques du monde 
(le Japon sera autour de 9 % de déficit, les États-Unis autour de 6 % et le 
Royaume-Uni autour de 5 %). Cela représente évidemment à l’heure actuelle 
un atout pour nous et un facteur de confiance à la fois pour les marchés et 
pour les agents économiques, qu’il convient de renforcer davantage.  
 
Au-delà de ces efforts au niveau national, un cadre renforcé de discipline 
commune a été mis en place, ce qui constitue une avancée importante vers 
une union économique plus intégrée.  
Le paquet législatif (appelé six-pack), qui est entré en vigueur en décembre 
dernier, renforce considérablement le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance : les 
pouvoirs de surveillance de la Commission européenne sur les budgets 
nationaux ont été accrus, les sanctions sont à présent quasi-automatiques, les 
critères de dette publique et de dépenses publiques font l’objet d’un suivi plus 
attentif. En outre, le Traité sur la stabilité, la coordination et la gouvernance 
met en place un nouveau « pacte budgétaire » comportant notamment 
l’exigence que le déficit public structurel annuel ne dépasse pas 0,5 % du PIB.  
Aux niveaux de dettes que nous connaissons actuellement, les agents 
économiques réagiraient à un laxisme en matière budgétaire en différant leurs 
propres dépenses privées. Les marchés financiers continueraient à imposer 
des taux d’intérêt très pénalisants à nos pays pour tenir compte de l’incertitude 
entourant les perspectives budgétaires. Globalement, la confiance induite et 
les avantages financiers d’un assainissement budgétaire l’emportent 
largement sur ses effets négatifs sur la demande effective à court terme. Il est 
essentiel que tous les efforts dans ce domaine soient poursuivis de manière 
résolue.  
Ensuite, concernant la compétitivité : là aussi, les progrès déjà réalisés en 
termes de réformes structurelles et d'ajustement des coûts unitaires de 
production dans de nombreux pays sont très encourageants. Dans le passé 
récent, les économies européennes ne se sont jamais autant réformées en 
aussi peu de temps. Je pourrais citer de nombreux exemples : la réforme du 
marché du travail en Espagne et en Italie, la réforme des retraites en Italie et 
en France. Ces réformes constituent les fondements nécessaires à une 
croissance future à la fois dynamique et durable et elles doivent être 
vigoureusement poursuivies. Par ailleurs, le nouveau Pacte de Stabilité 
 
comprend un mécanisme de surveillance des déséquilibres 
macroéconomiques, qui manquait jusqu'à présent.  
Enfin, les institutions sous-tendant la zone euro sont en train de se renforcer à 
une vitesse particulièrement élevée du fait de la crise.  
<U+F0F1> J'ai déjà mentionné le cadre de discipline budgétaire et 
macroéconomique largement renforcé : il faut se rendre compte que 
c'est un pas très important, compte tenu des transferts de souveraineté 
que cela représente. Nous avançons vers une union économique plus 
forte ;  
<U+F0F1> Le mécanisme européen de stabilité, dont la mise en œuvre début 2013 
s'est vue confortée par le feu vert donné par la Cour constitutionnelle 
allemande, dispose d'une force de frappe de 500Mds d'euros pour 
acheter directement des obligations d'État, apporter des garanties ou 
prêter des fonds. Il pourra en outre prêter directement de l'argent aux 
banques en difficulté, sans augmenter la dette de leurs pays d'origine, 
dès que le mécanisme unique de surveillance sera en place. C'est un 
outil puissant de résolution des crises dont est parvenue à se doter 
l'Europe ; à cela s’ajoutent les prêts, déjà consentis, de façon bilatérale 
ou dans le cadre du FESF ainsi que la facilité de l'UE existante, soit une 
force de frappe totale avoisinant les 1 000 milliards de dollars. 
<U+F0F1> Les travaux sur la mise en place de l'union bancaire avancent 
rapidement eux aussi. Le rapport de la Commission remis il y a 
quelques semaines pose des bases claires : toutes les banques de la 
zone euro seront rapidement soumises à une supervision unique sous 
l'autorité de la BCE. Dans la gestion quotidienne, les superviseurs 
nationaux seront en première ligne, selon le principe de décentralisation 
qui a déjà prouvé son efficacité pour la mise en œuvre de la politique 
monétaire unique au sein de l'Eurosystème. Le principe à la base de ce 
mécanisme de supervision unique est le suivant : si la crise de la zone 
euro a été aussi violente, c'est en grande partie parce qu'un cercle 
vicieux s'est développé entre les risques bancaire et souverain. Pour 
 
rompre ce lien, il faut une véritable union bancaire institutionnalisée 
garantissant non seulement la même supervision partout dans la zone, 
mais aussi des règles identiques, un mécanisme intégré de résolution 
des crises bancaires et un régime commun de garantie des dépôts. 
Nous avançons vers l'union bancaire et financière qui manquait à l'union 
monétaire.  
 
3. L'Eurosystème offre un soutien précieux dans cette période de 
nécessaires réformes 
Nous voyons bien que la responsabilité ultime de la sortie de crise incombe 
aux gouvernements, à titre national – pour se réformer, redresser leurs 
finances publiques, retrouver de la compétitivité – et à titre collectif – pour 
décider et mettre en œuvre un cadre institutionnel plus cohérent et complet 
autour de l'union monétaire. Ces réformes sont évidemment – et 
heureusement – le fruit d'un travail démocratique et ne peuvent être que cela. 
Mais, en contrepartie, ces réformes nécessaires ne peuvent pas être 
immédiates, elles prennent du temps, d'abord à être mises en œuvre, puis à 
produire leurs effets. Or le temps des marchés n'est pas celui de la 
démocratie, comme vous le savez. Les doutes ou les retards créent de la 
nervosité, de la volatilité, de l'inquiétude dans les marchés financiers qui se 
traduisent souvent par des hausses importantes de taux d'intérêt pour les pays 
jugés fragiles.  
L'Eurosystème a décidé d'intervenir fermement lorsqu'il estime que ces taux 
ne reflètent pas un véritable décalage de risque de crédit, mais une crainte 
infondée sur la réversibilité de l'euro. Car à ce moment là, l'efficacité de la 
politique monétaire unique est clairement menacée : les taux directeurs que 
nous fixons ne se transmettent plus à l'économie réelle de la même façon 
dans tous les pays via le canal du crédit bancaire – qui est un canal crucial en 
zone euro compte tenu de la part prépondérante du financement intermédié. 
Pour remplir notre mandat de maintien de la stabilité des prix, il faut que nos 
 
impulsions de politique monétaire puissent se transmettre de façon homogène 
dans la zone. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous avons décidé de nous doter 
d'un nouvel instrument d'action : les Outright Monetary Transactions. L'idée est 
de disposer d'un « backstop » crédible à l'augmentation injustifiée des taux 
d'intérêt souverains. Bien évidemment, ce « backstop » doit s'accompagner 
d'une conditionnalité stricte garantissant que le pays concerné progresse 
effectivement vers une situation économique plus robuste.  
Par ce nouvel outil, comme par tous les autres outils que nous avons mis en 
œuvre depuis le début de la crise – en particulier les mesures de soutien à la 
liquidité des banques -, l'Eurosystème s'efforce de soulager la pression des 
marchés qui peut menacer la capacité des États à mettre en œuvre les 
réformes engagées, et qui peut, à terme, menacer la stabilité des prix. Nous 
continuerons de tout mettre en œuvre pour remplir notre mandat et contribuer, 
dans ce cadre, à la réussite de cette période de transition délicate mais 
nécessaire, vers une union économique et monétaire plus cohérente, plus 
stable et plus dynamique.  
Je vous remercie pour votre attention et suis à votre disposition pour répondre 
à vos questions.

Comité Européen des Centrales de Bilans (ECCBSO) 
Réunion plénière à Paris des 18 et 19 octobre 2012 
Discours d’introduction de Robert OPHÈLE 
 
 
 
Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de vous souhaiter la bienvenue dans notre nouvel espace de 
conférence. Je suis ravi d’accueillir à cette réunion autant de participants de haut niveau aux 
profils variés, issus des univers des institutions statistiques ou des banques centrales – qu’elles 
soient ou non membres de l’Eurosystème – et qui partagent le même intérêt pour l’analyse 
micro-économique des entreprises. 
Nous sommes en effet très heureux d’organiser cette année la réunion plénière de l’ECCBSO 
qui va vous permettre de discuter en profondeur des dernières réalisations de vos groupes de 
travail ainsi que des chantiers envisagés pour l’avenir, dessinant ainsi un véritable plan d’action. 
Sans aucun doute, nous avons besoin d’explorer plus avant beaucoup de ces sujets dans lesquels 
votre Comité s’est pleinement impliqué, avec grand succès le plus souvent. C’est donc une très 
bonne opportunité pour la Banque de France d’organiser cette année cette conférence. Comme 
vous le savez, notre Banque Centrale est l’un des co-fondateurs du Comité et elle lui a toujours 
témoigné son attachement en contribuant activement à ses groupes de travail. 
Dans le cadre de mes précédentes expériences, particulièrement en tant que directeur général 
des Opérations, et aujourd’hui encore, en tant que Président de l’Autorité de Contrôle 
Prudentiel, je mesure tout l’apport de vos contributions en termes opérationnels (évaluation du 
risque) mais aussi en termes d’analyses (travaux de recherche, d’approfondissement, 
d’exploitation de la base BACH). Les activités de votre Comité et de ses groupes affiliés sont 
précieuses et je voudrais saisir l’occasion de cette réunion plénière pour vous encourager à 
poursuivre dans cette voie. Du point de vue d’une banque centrale nationale, vos contributions 
sont importantes dans la mesure où elles fournissent des bases sur lesquelles nous pouvons 
partager nos idées, nos savoir-faire et, mieux encore, nos données au sein de l’Eurosystème 
comme avec nos partenaires des institutions statistiques. En témoignent les travaux réalisés avec 
l’EGR (European Group Register administré par EUROSTAT) et désormais le CMFB 
(Committee for Monetary Financial and Balance of payment statistics). 
À l’évidence, les bilans et comptes de résultats, ou plus généralement les données sur les 
entreprises non financières, sont une remarquable source d’information pour nos institutions 
dans le cadre de deux de leurs principales missions : évaluer la situation individuelle des 
entreprises et recourir à des données agrégées pour conduire des analyses et recherches à 
vocation plus macro-économiques. 
Tout d’abord, vos travaux sont importants pour l’analyse micro-économique des 
entreprises basée sur des méthodes exploitant des ratios financiers. Ils sont utiles à 
l’évaluation des actifs que nous admettons en garantie, en tant que banque centrale, et à celle 
des portefeuilles de crédits des banques commerciales, pour ceux d’entre nous qui exerçons une 
mission de supervision bancaire, comme c’est notre cas à la Banque de France. 
Pour une banque centrale nationale membre de l’Eurosystème, l’évaluation individuelle des 
entreprises revêt une importance particulière si elle est reconnue comme ICAS (In-house Credit 
Assessment System) dans le cadre de l’ECAF (European Credit Assessment Framework). Les

banques centrales nationales qui bénéficient de ce statut (actuellement Allemagne, Autriche, 
Espagne et France) exploitent les bilans des entreprises pour en tirer une évaluation du risque de 
défaut dans des conditions précisément définies. Le statut d’ICAS est à cet égard exigeant, mais 
il est précieux car il nous permet de jouer un rôle essentiel dans la mise en œuvre de la politique 
monétaire. Dans ce contexte, nous devons pouvoir compter sur une méthodologie pertinente, 
consensuelle et reposant dans une large mesure sur notre capacité à produire une évaluation 
saine et robuste de la situation des entreprises non financières. Ce statut constitue donc une aide 
apportée aux banques centrales nationales pour l’exercice d’une de leurs fonctions essentielles, 
à savoir le refinancement des banques commerciales, et nous le vérifions chaque jour. 
Au sujet de l’évaluation du risque de crédit sur les entreprises, j’ai noté que plusieurs banques 
centrales nationales étaient sur le point de rejoindre les quatre actuelles ICAS : j’y vois le signe 
d’une reconnaissance de ce dispositif comme un bon moyen d’aider les banques commerciales à 
développer leurs prêts et, ainsi, à contribuer à la croissance économique. Toujours en lien avec 
ce sujet, je tiens à souligner la qualité du travail qui a été récemment mené par le WGRA 
(Working Group on Risk Assessment) pour comparer les processus d’évaluation du risque de 
crédit des banques centrales nationales au sein de l’Eurosystème : c’est là un sujet d’actualité et 
c’est un très bon exemple de ce que votre Comité peut nous apporter à tous. 
En second lieu, l’information sur les entreprises est utile à nos travaux macro-
économiques, à travers l’agrégation des données comptables en vue de la conduite de nos 
analyses économiques et des exercices de stress test que nous organisons. 
Au niveau macro-économique, l’analyse du secteur non financier est essentielle aussi bien pour 
les pouvoirs publics que pour les banques centrales. Du point de vue d’une banque centrale, ce 
diagnostic aide à assurer la stabilité financière, à travers la réalisation de différents types 
d’analyse économique et de stress tests, ces derniers ayant pris une importance cruciale en lien 
avec la crise.  
Les questions traitées par les groupes de travail ont ainsi plusieurs champs d’application 
immédiats. Que ce soit en explorant les nouvelles normes comptables, en élaborant de nouvelles 
bases de données, en développant de nouveaux modèles ou en adoptant une définition commune 
du défaut, les différents groupes de travail contribuent grandement à améliorer nos procédures et 
plus généralement notre compréhension des évolutions économiques. C’est pourquoi les 
publications de vos groupes, particulièrement sur le site internet de l’ECCBSO, jouent un rôle 
majeur dans l’approfondissement de nos connaissances et viennent enrichir les travaux menés 
par toutes les institutions participantes et au-delà : nous sommes tous convaincus qu’il n’y a que 
des avantages à accueillir ces travaux l’esprit ouvert. 
De ce point de vue, comme vous le savez, la Banque de France accorde une attention 
particulière à la gestion de la base BACH, depuis qu’elle a été choisie, il y a deux ans, pour 
assurer cette mission dans l’intérêt commun des membres de l’ECCBSO et au-delà. Nous 
œuvrons à son bon fonctionnement, et nous encourageons toutes les initiatives qui visent à 
exploiter les intéressantes séries statistiques qu’elle comporte. Parmi les nombreuses recherches 
qui ont été menées à partir de cette base, je voudrais citer l’étude publiée en février dernier par 
deux économistes de la BCE, Andra Buca et Philip Vermeulen, consacrée à « l’investissement 
des entreprises et la dépendance à l’égard du crédit bancaire pendant la récente crise 
financière ». La Banque de France, elle aussi, a publié plusieurs articles dans son Bulletin à 
partir de données issues de la base BACH. 
En ce qui concerne le groupe de travail chargé de la méthodologie IASB et plus généralement 
des groupes cotés en bourse, la Banque de France est intéressée par la coopération commencée 
l’an dernier avec Eurostat. Elle facilitera l’appréhension des structures des groupes européens et 
singulièrement des groupes multinationaux. Mais je comprends que ce groupe de travail 
s’investit aussi dans beaucoup d’autres sujets, dont l’exploitation d’une base de données dédiée 
(ERICA) qui procure de très bons résultats.  Il y a beaucoup de travail derrière cela et nous 
espérons que ces contributions à forte valeur ajoutée pourront bénéficier d’une large publicité.

Cette observation vaut aussi pour votre groupe d’études : vous êtes sur le point de diffuser un 
travail qui vise à mesurer la capacité des entreprises à faire face à un choc financier externe, au 
vu de l’expérience acquise ces dernières années. Cette publication retiendra assurément 
l’attention de nombreux observateurs. 
 
Au moment de conclure, je voudrais confirmer que la Banque de France, membre fondateur de 
l’ECCBSO, est toujours très impliquée dans tout ce qui a trait à l’analyse des entreprises. 
Votre présence ici aujourd’hui est certainement l’expression de votre propre intérêt pour ce 
domaine ; elle est de bon augure pour vos futurs travaux et elle est encourageante pour la 
poursuite de nos efforts conjoints. 
Finalement, je voudrais remercier personnellement le Président Manuel Ortega parce que je sais 
toute l’énergie qu’il consacre à ce Comité. Un grand merci aussi à vous tous pour votre 
présence, votre soutien et votre participation à cette réunion qui, je n’en doute pas, débouchera 
sur des débats fructueux. Si vous me le permettez, je voudrais ajouter un remerciement 
particulier à mes collègues de la direction des Entreprises et de la cellule du protocole, qui ont 
déployé beaucoup d’efforts pour organiser au mieux cette manifestation : sans leur aide, cette 
réunion n’aurait pas pu se tenir. 
Merci pour votre attention.

Prix du livre d’Économie 
 
Robert OPHELE 
Sous-gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
----------------- 
Paris, le 6 décembre 2012 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Chers amis, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être présent parmi vous pour ouvrir 
cette 14
ème
 Journée du livre d’Économie ; la participation de la Banque de 
France marque notre volonté et notre engagement à contribuer à diffuser la 
culture économique et financière auprès de nos concitoyens en général et des 
jeunes en particulier.  
Le thème de cette Journée, c’est la compétitivité de l’économie 
française. Je ne vais pas vous en parler directement car je ne veux pas 
anticiper sur les formidables panels que nous avons ce matin ; je vais vous 
parler du déficit de connaissance des Français en économie. 
 
Les Français passent pour n’avoir que de très vagues notions 
d’économie et un prix Nobel d’économie, Edmund Phelps, en aurait conclu 
qu’en relevant le niveau de culture économique des Français le potentiel de 
croissance de notre économie serait accru significativement, de 1 %. 
 
De fait, dans le cadre d’un sondage récent sur les Français et 
l’économie, réalisé par TNS-SOFRES pour la Banque de France, nous avons 
2 
 
demandé « Comment jugeriez-vous le niveau de connaissance des Français 
en économie ? ». Réponse : seuls 7 % de nos concitoyens le jugent bon, 59 % 
moyen, 32 % faible ou très faible. Du même sondage il ressort d’ailleurs que 
60 % des Français considèrent que l’information économique n’est pas 
compréhensible.  
 
Ce niveau médiocre résulte cependant d’une auto-évaluation et on 
connait la tendance naturelle à l’auto-flagellation dans ce type d’exercice ; 
j’observe d’ailleurs que l’insatisfaction augmente avec le niveau d’étude des 
sondés : si globalement 32 % considèrent que leur niveau de connaissance 
est faible ou très faible ce taux monte à 44 % pour les diplômés de 
l’enseignement supérieur. C’est bon signe ; en fait, plus on apprend, plus on 
réalise qu’on sait peu de choses. 
 
Gardons-nous donc de conclure trop vite et de surestimer nos 
lacunes. Mais prenons en conscience. Le CODICE (Conseil par la diffusion de 
la culture économique) avait réalisé en 2010 un quizz qui comportait des 
questions de raisonnement, de connaissances et d’économie pratique. La note 
moyenne obtenue était de 8,3/20 et le taux moyen des réponses justes était 
de 41% ; pour les diplômés de l’enseignement supérieur la note moyenne ne 
montait qu’à 9,8/20. De façon plus prosaïque, à la Banque de France, nous 
recevons plus de 200 000 dossiers de surendettement par an et dans de 
nombreux cas on relève une méconnaissance des mécanismes financiers de 
base, utiles à la gestion d’un budget familial, et qui auraient certainement 
réduit l’ampleur des problèmes rencontrés. 
 
Cette lacune en économie, qui résulte probablement d’une multitude de 
raisons sociologiques, philosophiques ou même religieuses, se conjugue en 
fait avec une méfiance quasi congénitale des français envers leurs 
concitoyens, les pouvoirs publics et les marchés ; cela a été excellemment  
mis en lumière par un livre très stimulant primé ici il y a quelques années (« La 
Société de défiance, comment le modèle social français s’autodétruit » de 
Yann Algan et Pierre Cahuc) - je vous recommande vraiment la lecture de ce 
3 
 
livre qui est court, simple et très éclairant - ; il en résulte des conséquences 
que je crois désastreuses pour notre croissance économique car cela 
constitue un formidable frein à la mise en œuvre des réformes ; c’est la 
société bloquée pour reprendre l’expression popularisée par Crozier en son 
temps mais trouvée il y a 50 ans par un chercheur américain pour caractériser 
la France. On n’accepte pas les réformes dont on ne comprend pas l’utilité 
économique et qui sont proposées par des gens ou des institutions en qui on 
n’a pas confiance. 
Or ces réformes, la crise – crise financière et crise économique - nous 
rappelle cruellement leur caractère indispensable.  Cette crise a été causée 
par des excès et des dérives dans le monde de la banque et de la finance. 
Nous faisons en sorte que cela ne recommence pas. C’est pourquoi, avec le 
gouvernement et avec nos homologues étrangers, nous travaillons à réformer 
et renforcer la réglementation et le contrôle des activités financières. Mais 
nous avons aussi besoin de la « bonne » finance, celle qui permet de créer, 
d’entreprendre, d’acquérir son logement, de s’assurer contre les risques de la 
vie, de financer les entreprises  C’est aussi notre métier, à la Banque de 
France, de veiller à cet équilibre.  
 
Notre pays a traversé une crise, sans précédent, il apparaît 
indispensable  dans ce contexte de faire œuvre de pédagogie et de donner 
aux Français une véritable culture économique et financière ; pour que les 
réformes nécessaires à notre sursaut de compétitivité puissent être mises en 
œuvre de manière efficace et sereine il faut qu’elles soient pleinement 
comprises et acceptées par les agents économiques. 
 
Je ne sais pas si Phelps avait raison lorsqu’il affirmait qu’en relevant 
le niveau de culture économique des Français le potentiel de croissance de 
l’économie se serait accru de 1 %, mais il est clair que le capital humain 
explique une partie importante de la croissance. Ce sont les économies où les 
agents sont les mieux formés qui font partie des économies les plus 
compétitives. La relation entre éducation et croissance économique est bien 
établie. Un niveau élevé d’éducation permet aussi de s’adapter plus facilement 
4 
 
aux nouvelles technologies et d’innover et l’innovation c’est une clef de la 
compétitivité de demain. 
 
S’intéresser à l’économie, lire l’économie, c’est se donner des clefs pour 
mieux comprendre l’environnement incertain dans lequel nous vivons, pour 
mieux analyser les tendances du monde contemporain, les risques et les 
opportunités. Cela vous permettra comme individu mais aussi comme citoyen 
français et européen d’être mieux préparés pour faire face aux défis de la 
compétition économique mondiale.   
 
Vous voyez ce qui vous reste à faire ! Je vous souhaite donc des 
débats stimulants et des lectures enrichissantes !

REMISE DES PRIX BANQUE DE FRANCE 
DU MICROCREDIT ACCOMPAGNE 2014 
20 JANVIER 2015 
 
CHRISTIAN NOYER, GOUVERNEUR  
DISCOURS INTRODUCTIF 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
C’est avec grand plaisir que je préside aujourd’hui la deuxième remise des « Prix du 
microcrédit accompagné » organisée par la Banque de France.  
Comme vous le savez, la Banque de France mène une action constante, depuis de 
nombreuses années, en faveur de l’accessibilité bancaire et financière, notamment via le 
droit au compte et la promotion du microcrédit accompagné. 
Le droit au compte permet à toute personne s’étant vue refuser une ouverture de compte 
bancaire de s’adresser à la Banque de France pour désigner une banque qui sera tenue de 
lui en ouvrir un. En 2013, 41 000 demandeurs ont pu bénéficier de cette procédure et ils ont 
été environ 50 000 en 2014. 
La Banque de France joue également un rôle crucial dans le traitement du surendettement. 
En moyenne annuelle sur ces dernières années, 225 000 dossiers ont été déposés auprès 
des secrétariats des commissions de surendettement. 
La loi du 26 juillet 2013 a conforté le rôle de la Banque de France en matière d’accessibilité 
financière en lui confiant la présidence de l’Observatoire de l’inclusion bancaire (OIB), créé 
dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre du plan pluriannuel contre la pauvreté et pour l’inclusion 
sociale. Il appartiendra à l’Observatoire de proposer au gouvernement des moyens 
permettant de renforcer la connaissance de l’inclusion bancaire et des progrès accomplis en 
2 
 
ce domaine. Le microcrédit accompagné constitue clairement l’un des moyens de favoriser 
l’inclusion financière des populations fragiles. L'OIB poursuivra donc, en ce domaine 
notamment, l’action menée au cours des dernières années par l'Observatoire de l'épargne 
réglementée. 
Comme vous le savez, le microcrédit accompagné est issu d’un partenariat exemplaire 
conclu entre emprunteurs, associations et établissements de crédit.  
Il bénéficie à des emprunteurs qui n'auraient pas ou auraient difficilement accès au crédit 
traditionnel.  
Il porte par nature sur de faibles montants : inférieurs à 3 000 euros lorsque le crédit est à 
usage personnel et, en général, inférieurs à 25 000 euros lorsqu’il finance des besoins 
professionnels. C’est la preuve que ce dispositif a du succès. L'encours global des 
microcrédits accompagnés a ainsi dépassé le milliard d'euros pour la première fois en 2013, 
alors que le nombre de microcrédits accordés a connu une augmentation de 13 %. 
Enfin, ce type de microcrédit repose sur l'accompagnement d'associations spécialisées 
auxquelles je souhaiterais rendre hommage aujourd’hui.  
Ces associations, qui sont en première ligne dans le combat contre l’exclusion bancaire, 
accomplissent en effet un travail remarquable en termes de sélection, d’accompagnement et 
de conseil aux emprunteurs. Le travail bénévole de milliers de représentants locaux et des 
équipes qui structurent et harmonisent leur action à l'échelon régional et à l’échelle nationale 
est exemplaire. Il permet à des personnes en situation de fragilité, que ce soit pour des 
motifs personnels – tels que des accidents de la vie – ou pour des raisons professionnelles – 
formation insuffisante, absence de moyens de transport, licenciements collectifs ou 
individuels – de retrouver par le travail une dignité et des moyens pérennes d'existence. 
Je voudrais insister sur ce point quelques instants : le microcrédit accompagné, au-delà de 
ses aspects purement techniques, de ses différentes modalités, est avant tout une façon 
d’œuvrer au service des personnes les moins favorisées, en leur permettant d'être des 
citoyens et des acteurs économiques à part entière. C'est aussi un acte de solidarité dont 
l’utilité n’est plus à démontrer. C'est enfin, pour des populations fragiles, un mécanisme qui 
leur offre une écoute attentive de leurs difficultés, mais aussi de leurs projets. Respect, 
solidarité, écoute, ce sont là des valeurs essentielles, dont les événements qui ont endeuillé 
ce début d’année nous ont rappelé l'impérieuse nécessité.  
3 
 
Ainsi, si les montants en cause peuvent être considérés comme modestes à l'échelle macro-
économique, l'effet individuel et l'impact économique et social du microcrédit accompagné 
demeurent très importants. 
Les histoires individuelles que relatent les candidatures aux prix du microcrédit 
constituent d’ailleurs un témoignage exemplaire, bien vivant, de l'efficacité de cette 
formule. 
Elles montrent qu'un financement approprié peut permettre des succès économiques et 
sociaux remarquables, alors même que les emprunteurs n’auraient pas eu accès au crédit 
usuel. Les lauréats qui vont être récompensés aujourd’hui en offrent une illustration 
éclatante, mais bien d’autres candidatures apportent également un témoignage similaire. 
Elles indiquent aussi que l’éducation financière réalisée par les associations 
accompagnatrices comme par les banques permet à certains projets, dont le succès était 
incertain au départ, de se développer progressivement dans des conditions financières 
correctes. Cela aboutit même parfois à la création de TPE relativement importantes, qui à 
leur tour embauchent et aident ainsi d'autres personnes à envisager l'avenir avec confiance. 
S'agissant de microcrédits personnels, l'éducation financière permet à tous de faire des 
choix raisonnés en termes de services bancaires. 
Enfin, ces histoires individuelles confirment, s’il en était besoin, qu’il est possible de mobiliser 
des acteurs de culture et d’horizon différents –emprunteurs, associations, banques – pour 
créer ensemble les conditions d’un succès et permettre la réalisation d’un projet. 
Je voudrais maintenant remercier chaleureusement le comité de sélection qui a réuni 
des associations – l'ADIE, Initiative France et le Secours catholique –, des banques – 
BNP PARIBAS et le Crédit Agricole –, le CCSF ainsi que les services de la Banque de 
France, d’avoir permis l’attribution de ces prix. 
Comme je l'indiquais, nous avons reçu beaucoup de belles candidatures qui reflètent la 
diversité des parcours personnels et des situations individuelles. Les candidats ont fait 
preuve d’un dynamisme inaltérable dans des situations parfois socialement difficiles. Aussi le 
choix a-t-il été de nouveau délicat. Comme lors de la précédente attribution, nous avons 
choisi non seulement de récompenser deux d'entre eux, mais de présenter également des 
'nominés'. 
J’adresse donc mes plus vives félicitations à tous les candidats qui ont été proposés pour 
l’attribution des prix. Leur détermination, leurs efforts et leur ténacité personnels ont été

essentiels dans la réussite de leur projet et, in fine, de cette manifestation. Je leur souhaite 
beaucoup de succès dans leurs futures entreprises.  
J'aurai enfin, dans quelques instants, le plaisir de féliciter plus directement et 
personnellement les deux lauréats. Mais je ne voudrais pas faire durer excessivement ces 
propos introductifs et il est temps qu’Emmanuel Constans, président du CCSF, et Jacques 
Fournier, Directeur Général des statistiques à la Banque de France, nous présentent les 
nominés, dont les projets seront ensuite exposés par leurs associations accompagnatrices. 
Je vous propose de débuter par les crédits personnels, dont je remettrai le prix au lauréat, 
avant de procéder de la même façon pour les crédits professionnels.

Paris, le vendredi 13 mars 2015 
 
Discours de clôture du Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 « Premières rencontres de l’Euro PP » 
Maison de la Chimie, Paris, 13 mars 2015, 15 h 30 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de conclure ces « Premières rencontres de l’Euro PP ». Le financement 
des entreprises constitue en effet un enjeu essentiel pour la croissance économique 
française et il fait actuellement l’objet d’évolutions profondes dont l’Euro PP est une 
illustration très emblématique. Alors que les financements de marché étaient largement 
réservés aux grandes entreprises et que les autres entreprises avaient presqu’exclusivement 
recours au crédit bancaire, la situation se modifie rapidement avec en particulier d’importants 
allègements des réglementations qui encadrent les opérations de crédit et les émissions de 
titres de dette. On peut désormais penser que, rapidement, presque tous les agents 
économiques seront en mesure, d’une façon ou d’une autre, de financer directement les 
entreprises. Cette évolution s’inscrivant dans une tendance européenne et dépassant donc 
largement le cadre français, il importe qu’on l’organise de manière à ce qu’elle bénéficie 
dans la durée à l’ensemble des agents économiques : les entreprises qui ont besoin de 
canaux de financement peu couteux et stables, les investisseurs, institutionnels ou non, qui 
ont besoin d’adapter les risques qu’ils prennent à leur capacité à les porter, les 
intermédiaires qui ont  la responsabilité d’assurer une bonne adaptation entre les besoins et 
les capacités de financement. Or on voit bien les dangers qui guettent ce mouvement de 
désintermédiation : mauvaise appréciation des risques par les investisseurs, dépendance 
2 
 
des entreprises à des modes de financement non pérennes, incapacité à traiter les situations 
difficiles qui appellent des restructurations, intermédiaires éphémères qui n’assurent pas 
dans la durée la qualité de service qu’on attend d’eux. 
De nombreuses initiatives ont été prises pour donner un cadre sécurisé à ces évolutions des 
modes de financement et la Banque de France y apporte sa contribution. Je pourrais 
évoquer notre soutien à la création de la société de titrisation de Place « Euro Secured Note 
Issuer » par cinq grands groupes bancaires, ouverte à de nouveaux entrants, afin 
d’encourager les crédits aux PME et d’en faciliter le refinancement. Je pourrais détailler 
l’intérêt du marché des billets de trésorerie que nous encadrons et souhaitons voir se 
développer au-delà des grandes entreprises ; nous avons mis en place une communication 
renforcée auprès des entreprises de taille intermédiaire (ETI) et accompagnons les 
émetteurs dans leurs démarches pour accéder au marché.  
Mais c’est naturellement sur les placements privés et l’Euro PP que je vais concentrer mon 
propos aujourd’hui car ils sont emblématiques de ces nouveaux modes de financement de 
l’économie et je crois que nous avons réussi collectivement, avec le dispositif élaboré, à 
éviter les écueils que je viens d’évoquer et à permettre un alignement des intérêts de 
l’ensemble des acteurs économiques concernés. 
Ce sont donc des financements octroyés par un nombre limité d’investisseurs institutionnels, 
qui relèvent d’un dispositif plus flexible que celui de l’offre au public, à partir d’une 
documentation négociée. Cela signifie que les conditions contractuelles peuvent être 
modulées en fonction des besoins, des contraintes et des particularités des entreprises 
comme des investisseurs. Les émetteurs bénéficient d’une diversification et d’une plus 
grande stabilité des financements au travers, à la fois, de créanciers engagés et 
effectivement présents sur le long terme et d’un allongement de la maturité adapté au 
financement de leurs projets. Des maturités à 6 ou 7 ans constituent en effet le cœur du 
marché de l’Euro PP et des émissions plus longues peuvent être réalisées. Les 
investisseurs, pour leur part, sont à la recherche d’une meilleure rémunération, d’un cadre 
protecteur et d’une meilleure répartition des risques. Ces avantages expliquent certainement 
qu’avec des opérations en constante augmentation, en nombre comme en montant total, les 
Euro PP connaissent un démarrage prometteur.   
 
Mais le rapide développement observé sur le marché des Euro PP n’aurait pas pu avoir lieu 
sans les travaux initiés par la Place, à l’initiative notamment de la Chambre de Commerce et 
d’Industrie de Paris Ile-de-France, et soutenus par les acteurs publics que sont la Banque de 
3 
 
France et la Direction générale du Trésor. Ces travaux privilégient une approche 
consensuelle, globale et équilibrée, en impliquant étroitement les associations 
professionnelles de l’ensemble des différentes parties prenantes. Ainsi, toute  la Place de 
Paris – investisseurs, entreprises, intermédiaires – a conjugué ses efforts, aux côtés des 
pouvoirs publics, afin de promouvoir et développer ce nouveau type de financement. Ce 
travail a abouti, en avril 2014, à l’élaboration de la Charte Euro PP qui définit un cadre de 
référence non contraignant de bonnes pratiques, destiné à accompagner le développement 
de ce marché et à en accroître la fluidité. 
Ce cadre est maintenant complété, depuis janvier dernier, par la mise à disposition  de 
modèles de contrats. Je tiens ici à souligner l’important travail pédagogique qui a été réalisé 
par la Place de Paris en rédigeant des modèles de contrats, à la fois selon le format de prêt 
et selon le format obligataire, ainsi que la contribution notable des différents cabinets 
d’avocats impliqués. Cette documentation a été réalisée toujours dans le même souci de 
partenariat et dans une véritable volonté de développement international. J’en veux pour 
preuve la disponibilité de la documentation en français mais aussi en anglais et sa traduction 
future en allemand et en italien. Les Euro PP constituent ainsi une offre parfaitement 
complémentaire à celle des USPP aux États-Unis et des Schuldscheine en Allemagne. 
 
A ce stade de son développement, le marché des Euro PP jouit donc d’atouts extrêmement 
prometteurs. Il n’en reste pas moins que plusieurs conditions doivent encore être réunies 
pour en faire un outil courant de financement. La clé se situe à la fois aux niveaux européen, 
national et local. 
 
À l’échelle européenne, outre le raffermissement de la croissance, l’enjeu essentiel est celui 
d’une allocation du capital efficace et robuste, tirant tous les bénéfices de la libre circulation, 
du marché unique et de l’union monétaire, à travers notamment le projet d’Union des 
marchés de capitaux (CMU, en anglais) de la Commission Européenne, qui devrait être mis 
en place par étape d’ici à 2019. Ce projet, qui complète l’Union bancaire, même s’il est d’une 
nature différente, vise à accroitre les flux de capitaux finançant l’investissement, à diversifier 
les risques et à allouer plus efficacement l’épargne tant au niveau national qu’entre les pays 
du marché européen.  
Parmi les cinq priorités retenues par la Commission Européenne dans le cadre de la CMU 
figure le développement des marchés de placements privés européens. La Commission 
4 
 
privilégie à ce stade l’approche dite « industry-led », qui a été jusqu’à présent développée. 
J’ai le plaisir de constater que les travaux du Comité de pilotage Euro PP ont permis de 
promouvoir les meilleures pratiques développées par la Place dans le cadre d’une approche 
tripartite spécifiquement française (associant émetteurs, investisseurs et intermédiaires) au 
niveau européen. Ils contribuent ainsi, de manière significative, à l’émergence d’un marché 
européen des placements privés. À cet égard, je tiens à saluer l’association du Comité de 
pilotage Euro PP et le groupe européen sur les placements privés coordonné par 
l’International Capital Market Association (ICMA) ;  dont les travaux ont récemment permis 
l’élaboration d’un guide pan-européen sur les placements privés, lequel contribue utilement à 
la structuration d’un marché des placements privés en Europe. Ce guide fait notamment 
référence à la Charte Euro PP ainsi qu’aux modèles de contrat standard élaborés 
respectivement par le Comité de pilotage Euro PP, en droit français, et par la Loan Market 
Association (LMA), en droit anglais.  
Ces initiatives autour de nouveaux instruments de financement des entreprises sont 
complémentaires et offrent aux participants de marché une large palette d’outils, dans le 
contexte d’un marché naissant qui s’adapte aux droits et doctrines locaux. Elles ont vocation 
à évoluer, parallèlement au développement et à l’internationalisation des transactions.  
 
Au niveau national, il est certes important d’œuvrer à la promotion de ces modes de 
financement de marché. Mais encore faut-il mettre en place l’environnement adéquat et 
savoir quels types d’entreprises sont les plus susceptibles d’y recourir. C’est précisément 
l’un des objectifs du Comité Paris 2020. Or le mode de financement adapté aux différentes 
entreprises est en général fonction de leur taille. Avec une part de crédits bancaires qui ne 
dépasse pas 25%, les grandes entreprises sont celles qui ont le plus recours au marché. A 
l’inverse, avec une part de crédits bancaires qui est encore de 70%, le mode de financement 
des ETI les rapproche aujourd’hui davantage des PME. Le coût d’une émission classique 
leur paraît excessif, au regard de leurs besoins de financements. Or, ce sont précisément 
ces coûts d’émission que l’initiative Euro PP vise à atténuer afin de permettre à davantage 
d’ETI de profiter de cette opportunité pour diversifier et adapter à leur besoin précis leurs 
sources de financement. 
À cet effet, l’accès à la base de données FIBEN de la Banque de France, et particulièrement 
à la cotation des entreprises, que le projet de loi pour la croissance, l’activité et l’égalité des 
chances économiques – plus connu sous le nom de loi « Macron » - prévoit d’ouvrir aux 
entreprises d’assurance, aux mutuelles, aux institutions de prévoyance et à leurs sociétés de 
5 
 
gestion, est de nature à faciliter l’instruction des dossiers de projets d’Euro PP par ces 
investisseurs. Il leur donnera également les moyens de maitriser les risques induits par 
l’octroi de tels financements.  
En analysant, à travers leur cotation par la Banque de France, les entreprises ayant émis 
des Euro PP, il apparaît qu’elles se caractérisent globalement par une très bonne situation 
financière. En parallèle, la proportion des ETI parmi les émetteurs n’a cessé de croître 
depuis le lancement de l’initiative. Tout concourt donc à un élargissement prononcé du 
périmètre des entreprises susceptibles d’appeler l’attention d’investisseurs cherchant à 
diversifier leurs risques dans le cadre d’une émission d’Euro PP.  
Au niveau local, le développement de nouveaux instruments de  financement doit pouvoir se 
faire sur l’ensemble du territoire national et bénéficier à la totalité du tissu économique en 
France. Cette allocation de financements stables et maîtrisés à destination des ETI est 
fondamentale afin de leur permettre de se développer, celles-ci étant présentes dans le 
secteur industriel et représentant une part importante dans la valeur ajoutée du pays. En 
fonction de différents critères de robustesse financière, la Banque de France a ciblé des ETI 
auprès desquelles une action de promotion des Euro PP est actuellement menée sous 
l’égide de ses directeurs régionaux. Je compte sur les réunions de Place en région pour 
relayer l’initiative de ces « Premières rencontres » et continuer le travail de pédagogie et de 
consensus entamé par le Comité de Pilotage, afin de toujours plus développer la 
diversification des sources de financement. 
Pour asseoir le développement et la pérennité du marché, l’engagement des investisseurs 
institutionnels et des gestionnaires d’actifs est essentiel. Cet engagement ne se mesure pas 
seulement à l’aune des montants investis mais aussi par le haut niveau de 
professionnalisme des parties prenantes. Alors que ces instruments sont par nature destinés 
à être détenus jusqu’à leur terme, les différents acteurs doivent agir avec prudence dans la 
mesure où le risque pesant sur ces entreprises est souvent complexe à analyser et où les 
émetteurs ne sont généralement pas notés par un tiers. Les investisseurs institutionnels 
doivent avoir un dispositif robuste de gestion des risques afin de prendre ces décisions 
d’investissement. Les banques ont également un rôle fondamental à jouer dans leurs 
différentes fonctions. Je salue, en particulier, leur action dans la fixation d’un cadre de 
référence et j’incite l’ensemble des intermédiaires à continuer d’agir en responsabilité dans la 
sélection et l’analyse des risques, de façon à assurer la robustesse du marché et la stabilité 
financière.  
 
6 
 
Au moment de conclure cette journée, il me paraît essentiel que l’initiative concernant les 
Euro PP soit promue, tant elle répond aux besoins des différents acteurs économiques 
(entreprises, investisseurs et intermédiaires). Je tiens encore à féliciter la Place qui a su se 
mobiliser et démontrer ainsi sa capacité à dégager un consensus face à ces enjeux cruciaux. 
C’est en encourageant, comme elle le fait, l’essor de nouveaux modes de financement 
qu’elle contribue à conforter l’investissement des entreprises et la reprise de la croissance, 
en France comme en Europe.  
Mesdames, Messieurs, je vous remercie pour votre attention.

Séminaire annuel GIC/BDF 
 
De nouvelles politiques pour l’après-crise 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
Session I : Remettre la politique monétaire dans son contexte, de part et d’autre de l’Atlantique 
 
Taille du bilan des banques centrales : quelle pertinence, quelle importance ? 
 
 
1. Un accroissement généralisé du bilan des banques centrales 
 
Le bilan des banques centrales a fortement augmenté, en taille comme en pourcentage du PIB, dans 
l’ensemble des grandes puissances économiques. Dans la zone euro, cette évolution a connu une inversion 
temporaire, mais le bilan des banques centrales de l’Eurosystème est appelé à s’accroître de nouveau, à la 
suite de la mise en œuvre des programmes d’achats d’actifs récemment décidés, plus particulièrement 
s’agissant du programme étendu d’achats de titres du secteur public (Public Sector Purchase Programme 
– PSPP).  
 
Depuis 2007, la taille des bilans des banques centrales a triplé, en données agrégées, dans le monde entier, 
pour atteindre un montant de 22 000 milliards de dollars fin 2014. Fait intéressant, cette hausse a concerné 
aussi bien  les économies avancées que les économies émergentes. Dans les pays avancés, les banques 
centrales ont procédé à des achats d’actifs nationaux. Leurs bilans sont passés, en moyenne, de 10 à 20 % 
du PIB au cours des sept dernières années. Dans les économies émergentes, l’accumulation de réserves de 
change représente l’essentiel de la progression constatée. Les économies avancées connaissent néanmoins 
2 
des situations diverses : tandis que le bilan de la Banque du Canada représente 5 % du PIB canadien, le 
montant des actifs détenus par la Banque nationale suisse représente 80 % du PIB helvétique. 
 
Des facteurs discrétionnaires et des facteurs techniques expliquent ces différences et ces évolutions. Les 
premiers concernent les pays qui optent pour l’accumulation de réserves de change. Les seconds, 
discrétionnaires, sont actuellement à l’œuvre dans la zone euro, dans la mesure où le bilan de la BCE 
exerce une fonction d’intermédiation entre les banques centrales nationales, par le biais du système 
Target 2. Ainsi, les soldes affichés au sein du système en question tendent, de façon mécanique, à 
augmenter en période de segmentation du marché, c’est-à-dire lorsque le marché interbancaire est perturbé 
et que les flux de capitaux au sein de la zone euro sont considérables. De même, lorsque les opérations de 
politique monétaire sont réalisées sous la forme d’opérations dites d’open market ou de prise en pension, 
la taille du bilan devient plus ou moins tributaire de la taille du marché interbancaire. 
 
Toutefois, le récent accroissement de la taille des bilans des banques centrales résulte d’un changement de 
nature de politique monétaire. Les banques centrales ont en effet adopté une approche proactive, plutôt 
que simplement passive, de la gestion de leurs bilans. En langage imagé, elles ont « mis ces bilans au 
travail ». Par conséquent, les « volumes », c’est à-dire les montants d’actif et de passif définis, jouent 
désormais un rôle de plus en plus important, du point de vue de l’élaboration de la politique monétaire, par 
rapport aux « prix », à savoir le niveau des taux d’intérêt.   
 
Il s’agit là, bien sûr, d’une composante et d’une conséquence des politiques monétaires non 
conventionnelles mises en œuvre. Les canaux traditionnels de transmission de la politique monétaire – en 
premier lieu le canal des taux d’intérêt – sont devenus inefficaces : tout d’abord, parce que les économies 
ont atteint la borne zéro des taux d’intérêt ; et, dans certains cas, comme dans celui de la zone euro, parce 
que le canal du crédit s’est obstrué. L’expansion des bilans résulte des tentatives effectuées pour dépasser 
ces limites et permettre ainsi aux politiques monétaires de remplir leurs missions, grâce à la mise en œuvre 
d’un programme d’achats d’actifs de grande ampleur.  
 
 
2. Est-ce la taille du bilan ou sa composition  qui importe davantage ? 
 
Les causes et les conséquences des évolutions de la taille des bilans sont assez variées. D’un point de vue 
général, l’actif et le passif des banques centrales ont tous deux de l’importance. Le passif augmente 
lorsque la banque centrale accroît l’apport de liquidités au secteur bancaire, avec pour objectif explicite 
3 
l’atténuation des tensions en matière de financement de l’économie, par la réduction de son coût. Il s’agit 
en définitive d’influer sur le comportement des banques en matière de prêt, ce que l’Eurosystème a fait à 
plusieurs reprises. L’augmentation du passif est sans doute moins volontariste lorsqu’elle résulte de la 
fixation d’un taux de change plancher, comme c’est le cas pour la Banque nationale suisse. S’agissant de 
l’actif, les achats d’actifs réduisent la prime de risque, entraînent un rééquilibrage des portefeuilles, 
aplatissent la courbe des rendements, accentuent la prise de risque dans le secteur privé et modifient les 
anticipations à la hausse. Comme vous le savez, l’Eurosystème s’est engagé dans un programme étendu 
d’achats d’actifs, le PSPP, qui fait suite à d’autres programmes de moindre ampleur d’achats de titres 
adossés à des actifs (ABSPP) et d’obligations sécurisées (CBPP3). 
Les débats techniques sont réels. Certains affirment que les stocks d’actifs détenus par les banques 
centrales importent plus que les flux d’achats qu’elles engagent. Pour d’autres, ce sont la composition et le 
volume des achats qui constituent les véritables leviers. La question qui se pose réellement est de savoir si 
l’accroissement de la base monétaire est suffisant pour favoriser l’augmentation du crédit ou si cette 
dernière est liée à la volonté des banques d’accroître ou non l’offre de crédit et, de façon plus significative 
encore, à l’appétence des agents économiques en matière d’emprunt. Si l’on observe la conduite des 
politiques monétaires au cours des dernières décennies, les banques ont toujours eu la possibilité, à un 
niveau donné de taux d’intérêt, d’accroître l’offre de crédit indépendamment de la taille du bilan de la 
banque centrale. Le fait d’avoir atteint la borne zéro ne change rien à cette réalité. J’aurais donc tendance 
à dire que, compte tenu des canaux de transmission d’un programme d’achats d’actifs, la composition et la 
durée sont probablement aussi importants que la taille. 
Quoi qu’il en soit, l’accroissement de la taille du bilan de la banque centrale, par des achats d’actifs à 
grande échelle, envoie des signaux très importants qui agissent à plusieurs niveaux. Ils peuvent contribuer 
à renforcer la forward guidance sur la politique du taux directeur. Surtout, ils peuvent exercer une 
incidence directe sur les anticipations d’inflation, permettant ainsi la diminution des taux d’intérêt réels. 
Lorsque la taille du bilan est explicitement liée à l’atteinte d’un objectif d’inflation, comme c’est le cas au 
Japon, elle peut constituer un outil efficace pour prouver aux agents la détermination de l’autorité 
monétaire, ce que les économistes appellent un « mécanisme d’engagement » (commitment device).  
Les signaux concernant le bilan de l’Eurosystème ont joué récemment un  rôle important. En 
novembre 2014, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a déclaré que le bilan devrait retrouver la taille 
qu’il affichait début 2012 et les marchés ont alors commencé à anticiper un programme d’achats d’actifs. 
Plus récemment, le programme d’achats d’actifs qui se poursuivra jusqu’à fin septembre 2016 a constitué 
un signal clair et important du maintien de l’orientation expansionniste de la politique monétaire sur une 
4 
période longue. 
Ces effets de signal ont été très efficaces et, à la suite de l’annonce le 22 janvier dernier du programme 
étendu d’achats d’actifs, des mouvements de grande ampleur se sont produits sur les marchés financiers, 
caractérisés notamment par une baisse des taux d’intérêt anticipés sur l’ensemble des échéances, par un 
recul des rendements des obligations d’État et d’entreprises et par une hausse des cours boursiers. 
3. Faut-il craindre certains inconvénients liés à la progression des bilans des banques centrales ? 
L’utilisation active de leur bilan par les principales banques centrales a soulevé un certain nombre 
d’inquiétudes. À cet égard, j’aborderai trois questions.  
 
En premier lieu, lorsque les politiques monétaires non conventionnelles ont commencé à être mises en 
œuvre, de nombreux analystes ont craint que l’expansion de la base monétaire ne déclenche des pressions 
inflationnistes et que les banques centrales ne perdent le contrôle sur la stabilité des prix. Comme nous le 
savons tous, c’est l’inverse qui s’est produit. Les agrégats monétaires larges ont globalement peu évolué 
dans la zone euro au cours des dix-huit derniers mois, le multiplicateur monétaire s’est effondré et 
l’inflation a diminué, revenant à un niveau bien inférieur à notre définition de la stabilité des prix.  
 
En deuxième lieu, d’autres questions, plus insistantes, se posent quant aux implications « quasi-
budgétaires » des bilans des banques centrales. Certains ont le sentiment que l’expansion des bilans crée 
un nouvel environnement dans lequel la relation entre les banques centrales et les États se complique. 
Selon eux, cette expansion exposerait les banques centrales à de nouveaux risques : elle accroîtrait leur 
vulnérabilité et compromettrait leur indépendance. 
 
En troisième lieu, une abondante littérature théorique étudie la solvabilité des banques centrales. 
J’interprète ainsi les conclusions de cette littérature : presque tous les analystes s’accordent sur le fait 
qu’une banque centrale ne peut faire faillite, puisqu’elle peut émettre autant de numéraire et de réserves 
que nécessaire pour honorer ses engagements. Il est déjà arrivé que quelques banques centrales jouissant 
d’une excellente réputation aient fonctionné avec une situation nette négative sur de longues périodes. 
Cependant, la plupart des économistes soulignent alors que l’émission monétaire illimitée mettrait 
certainement en danger la stabilité des prix. Par conséquent, même si l’existence d’une banque centrale 
n’est pas mise en péril par son insolvabilité, sa capacité à accomplir ses missions pourrait certainement 
s’en trouver compromise, de même que son indépendance, puisqu’elle dépendrait alors des pouvoirs 
publics pour reconstituer ses fonds propres.  
5 
 
Il est très important de comprendre que l’Eurosystème est totalement protégé contre une telle éventualité. 
Lors de sa création, il a été doté de fonds propres élevés, qu’il a continué de renforcer par des bénéfices 
non distribués et des recapitalisations occasionnelles. L’Eurosystème est unique, à cet égard, parmi les 
économies avancées. Tant son indépendance que sa capacité à remplir son mandat sont garanties, et ce 
même dans des circonstances économiques très défavorables. Même si cela ne doit pas conduire à 
l’autosatisfaction et à la négligence, l’existence de ces coussins de sécurité doit atténuer les inquiétudes 
quant aux éventuels risques susceptibles de résulter de l’expansion du bilan des banques centrales. 
 
Enfin, le gonflement des bilans des banques centrales peut être perçu comme un facteur à même 
d’influencer l’allocation des ressources ou de provoquer des transferts budgétaires implicites. C’est une 
question particulièrement sensible au sein de la zone euro. Pour l’étudier, il est utile de se référer à la 
fameuse classification de Musgrave qui distingue trois objectifs des politiques économiques : l’allocation 
des ressources, la redistribution des revenus et la stabilisation de l’activité. De toute évidence, la politique 
monétaire est concernée uniquement et exclusivement par l’objectif de stabilisation, et par une 
composante très restreinte de celle-ci : la stabilité des prix. Aucune mesure de politique monétaire ne doit 
être mise en œuvre en vue de l’atteinte d’un autre objectif, quel qu’il soit. Ainsi, dans la mesure où des 
outils « non conventionnels » sont mobilisés, aucune ambiguïté ne doit exister quant à leur lien étroit avec 
la mission d’une banque centrale, qui est de maintenir la stabilité des prix. Je pense que cela s’est vérifié 
dans l’ensemble des principaux États et, assurément, dans la zone euro. 
 
4. Comment limiter les effets indésirables des politiques monétaires conduites ? 
 
À la vérité, toutefois, le monde réel ne coïncide pas toujours parfaitement avec la pureté de la 
classification de Musgrave. Certaines politiques publiques peuvent viser l’atteinte de plusieurs objectifs. 
D’autres peuvent avoir, sans le vouloir, des effets secondaires indésirables. Toutes les politiques publiques 
sans aucune exception, en matière de santé, d’énergie ou d’infrastructures, affectent involontairement 
certains citoyens plus que d’autres.  
 
Ces effets secondaires doivent être réduits autant que possible, mais ils ne peuvent pas être entièrement 
évités. La politique monétaire n’est pas épargnée par la complexité du monde réel. Par exemple, plusieurs 
mesures non conventionnelles pourraient avoir eu des effets redistributifs imprévus, en poussant les prix 
des actifs à la hausse, au bénéfice de certains ménages disposant d’un patrimoine financier important. Par 
ailleurs, favoriser la reprise économique et réduire le chômage va dans le sens d’un soutien aux groupes 
6 
les plus vulnérables de la population. Dans d’autres cas, une intervention forte peut susciter de légitimes 
inquiétudes relatives à ce qu’on nomme l’aléa moral. Les banques centrales auraient-elles dû se retenir 
d’agir, au risque de ne pas accomplir leur mission ?  
 
Ces questions simples nous rappellent que la prise de décision comporte toujours des arbitrages. Il est 
d’autant plus important que les responsables de la politique économique restent clairement concentrés sur 
leur objectif ultime. Les banques centrales doivent faire le maximum pour éviter tout effet indésirable 
d’allocation ou de redistribution de leurs politiques. Ces politiques doivent être conçues pour être les plus 
neutres possible. Cela étant, l’éventualité d’effets secondaires indésirables ne doit pas paralyser la prise de 
décision lorsqu’elle est nécessaire pour l’accomplissement de leurs mandats.  
 
L’Eurosystème a été confronté à une telle situation au moment de décider de son programme d’achats 
d’actifs de grande ampleur. Je crois que les décisions prises alors reflètent un bon équilibre entre la 
nécessité de remplir les missions imparties et le souhait d’éviter les effets secondaires indésirables. Les 
grands principes qui sous-tendent la mise en œuvre du PSPP ont été la réduction, autant que possible, de 
l’ampleur des éventuelles conséquences imprévues, et le maintien d’une complète neutralité, comme 
l’illustre par exemple le choix de la clé de répartition du capital de la BCE pour déterminer les achats à 
effectuer parmi les différentes dettes publiques nationales. 
Il est également important de souligner le fait que les effets secondaires indésirables peuvent être réduits si 
les différentes autorités publiques agissent dans un cadre bien défini et respecté. Un tel cadre existe bel et 
bien au sein de la zone euro. Il repose sur une discipline budgétaire orientée vers la réduction de la dette. 
Si cette discipline n’est pas respectée ou si elle est mise en œuvre avec une vigilance insuffisante, la 
politique monétaire menée par le biais d’achats de titres du secteur public peut être perçue comme créant 
un aléa moral important, affaiblissant ainsi le nécessaire consensus et compromettant son efficacité.  
 
Lorsque des transferts budgétaires interviennent entre pays de la zone euro, ils sont mis en œuvre au 
moyen de programmes conditionnels décidés d’un commun accord. Il existe une tentation permanente 
d’effacer la distinction entre ces programmes budgétaires et les opérations de politique monétaire et de 
liquidité de la banque centrale. Il faut résister à cette tentation. C’est la raison pour laquelle l’Eurosystème 
s’est montré extrêmement rigoureux dans l’application, transparente et neutre, de ses règles relatives aux 
garanties.  
 
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure.  
7 
 
Les politiques monétaires non conventionnelles sont nécessaires, mais complexes. Elles créent davantage 
d’interférences avec les marchés que les politiques conduites en temps normal. En conséquence, il devient 
plus difficile d’éviter les retombées involontaires des politiques de stabilisation sur l’allocation et la 
redistribution des ressources. Cette réalité ne doit pas empêcher les banques centrales d’agir de manière 
décisive en présence de risques pesant sur la stabilité des prix. Mais de telles actions exigent rigueur et 
précision dans leur mise en œuvre. Pour les banques centrales, le bilan est devenu le principal outil de 
politique monétaire, du moins pour l’avenir proche. Il a démontré son efficacité. Il peut être – et sera – 
utilisé d’autant plus efficacement que l’environnement de la politique économique demeurera sain.

Paris Europlace Forum financier international – 20 avril 2015 
« FAVORISER LA CROISSANCE ÉCONOMIQUE EN EUROPE » 
 
Table ronde 3 : Revue de la stabilité financière de la Banque de France   
« Financement de l’économie : de nouveaux canaux pour la croissance » 
Introduction de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
L’objectif de cette troisième table ronde est de lancer le dernier numéro de la Revue de la stabilité 
financière de la Banque de France intitulé « Financement de l’économie : de nouveaux canaux pour la 
croissance » et qui traite essentiellement du besoin accru de financement de marché. Je suis très 
heureux de débattre de ce sujet tout à fait d’actualité dans un pays qui a adopté depuis longtemps le 
financement de marché et qui a beaucoup à nous apprendre à ce sujet. Aux États–Unis, 80 % du 
financement par endettement est effectué sur les marchés de capitaux tandis que cette proportion n’est 
que de 20 % dans la zone euro. Cette nouvelle publication de notre RSF, tout comme les précédentes, 
rassemble les contributions d’éminents universitaires, professionnels et décideurs venus du monde 
entier. Je remercie chaleureusement l’ensemble des auteurs. Je ne peux pas les citer tous, mais Sheila 
Bair et Barbara Novick, entre autres, sont parmi nous aujourd’hui. Ces contributions sont très diverses, 
voire divergentes, en termes d’analyses et de propositions. C’est précisément ce que nous voulons. Il 
est clair que nous ne partageons pas nécessairement les opinions exprimées dans les articles, mais nous 
croyons au débat d’idées. 
 
 
2/4 
 
Globalement, cette nouvelle RSF met l’accent sur trois grands aspects du financement de l’économie :  
 
- Les exigences réglementaires ont et continueront d’exercer une influence importante sur le 
comportement et les stratégies des intervenants de marché.  
- La transition vers un profil de financement plus équilibré doit être soutenue par une intervention des 
pouvoirs publics. 
- Beaucoup reste à faire pour drainer plus efficacement les ressources et assurer un flux de 
financement à long terme suffisant, ce qui est un préalable à la reprise et à la croissance.   
 
Avant que nous n’entamions la discussion, je souhaiterais partager avec vous quelques réflexions 
personnelles sur ce sujet. 
 
À mon avis, les problèmes de financement de l’économie sont essentiellement de deux ordres : 
 
- D’une part, certains compartiments de l’économie, à savoir les PME et les infrastructures, 
dépendent fortement du financement bancaire, en raison de l’existence de coûts fixes élevés et 
d’asymétries d’information importantes. En effet, les banques sont mieux armées pour évaluer 
la solvabilité de ces contreparties ou de ces projets. Face à cette situation, il est nécessaire de 
débloquer le crédit bancaire. 
- D’autre part, et cela concerne l’ensemble de l’économie, il est essentiel de favoriser le 
développement d’un financement de marché en complément du financement bancaire. Bien 
que cette évolution soit déjà commencée, sa vitesse et son ampleur sont variables selon les 
pays et les secteurs.  
 
L’élaboration d’une structure de financement plus équilibrée est un processus nécessairement long, qui 
exige un engagement fort et une intervention des pouvoirs publics. En Europe, une série d’initiatives, 
conduites par les autorités, sont en cours pour relancer le marché moribond de la titrisation, mais 
également pour développer les marchés de placement privé. À propos de la titrisation, permettez-moi 
de souligner qu’elle a indûment souffert en Europe de l’expérience des États–Unis, bien qu’elle ait été 
beaucoup moins susceptible de faire défaut. Plus généralement, le projet d’Union des marchés de 
capitaux de la Commission européenne soutiendra l’augmentation des flux de financement, la 
diversification des risques et une meilleure allocation des ressources. 
 
Cette évolution vers davantage de financement de marché comporte deux conséquences principales, 
du point de vue de la stabilité financière : 
 
- Premièrement, la prolifération de la réglementation crée de l’incertitude pour les intervenants 
de marché. L’analyse de l’incidence cumulée des réglementations et de leurs interactions n’a 
commencé que depuis peu mais elle doit être poursuivie. La vigilance est effectivement 
3/4 
 
indispensable pour s’assurer que la mise en œuvre des réformes n’entraîne pas une réduction 
des activités essentielles pour le financement des investissements et des entreprises. Je pense 
notamment à l’activité de tenue de marché qui montre des signes de recul, en partie en raison 
des coûts liés à la réglementation. Cette baisse doit être surveillée dans un système financier 
où nous encourageons le financement de marché et où la tenue de marché est cruciale pour les 
émetteurs et les investisseurs. 
- Deuxièmement, le développement de sources de financement alternatives, extérieures au 
système bancaire, apporte une nécessaire diversification. Cependant, les risques associés à la 
désintermédiation sont clairs, notamment une évaluation limitée des risques ou une moindre 
capacité à gérer les situations difficiles par les investisseurs et certaines lacunes dans la 
supervision. En parallèle, la réintermédiation non bancaire soulève des questions d’égalité de 
traitement liées à l’irrégularité de la réglementation et de la surveillance d’un secteur ou d’un 
pays à l’autre. 
 
Pour discuter de ces importantes questions, nous avons le grand privilège de réunir aujourd’hui un 
panel exceptionnel composé de :  
 
<U+F0B7> Mme Sheila Bair, présidente du Conseil du risque systémique, ancienne présidente du Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), qui est sans conteste un régulateur éminent. Chère 
Sheila, votre contribution à la construction d’un système financier plus robuste, au service de 
l’économie, est particulièrement impressionnante et vos idées sur la façon de le rendre encore 
plus résistant sont très pertinentes ;  
<U+F0B7> Nous accueillons également Mme Barbara Novick, vice-présidente de Blackrock et auteur 
d’articles marquants traitant de gestion d’actifs et de politiques publiques ; ainsi que M. Alain 
Papiasse, Directeur général adjoint de BNP Paribas, représentant le groupe en Amérique du 
Nord. Barbara et Alain sont deux professionnels des marchés de haut niveau ayant une 
expérience approfondie de la gestion d’actifs et des activités de banque d’investissement. 
Donc, chère Barbara, cher Alain, j’espère que vous allez nous apporter vos avis « d’initiés » et 
des visions complémentaires de ce que signifie réellement le financement de l’économie.  
<U+F0B7> Et enfin, permettez-moi de vous présenter M. Thomas Philippon, un universitaire distingué de 
NYU, spécialisé notamment dans l’évolution du secteur financier. Cher Thomas, votre 
recherche sur la financiarisation de l’économie offrira un point de vue original en mettant en 
perspective les relations qui existent entre le secteur financier et l'économie. 
 
Je vous remercie tous d'être parmi nous aujourd'hui. 
 
Je donne à présent la parole à nos panélistes. Je propose que chaque intervenant fasse une présentation 
de 10 minutes avant d’entamer le véritable débat entre les membres du panel, à l’issue duquel nous 
4/4 
 
nous tournerons vers le public. Mme Bair interviendra en premier, suivie de Mme Novick, puis du 
Professeur Philippon et pour finir M. Papiasse. Sheila, je vous laisse la parole.

PRÉSENTATION DU RAPPORT D’ACTIVITÉ DE L’AUTORITÉ DE CONTRÔLE 
PRUDENTIEL ET DE RÉSOLUTION POUR 2014 
Conférence de presse du mardi 26 mai 2015 
Discours de Christian Noyer 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour cette conférence de presse de 
présentation du 5e rapport d’activité de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, 
l’ACPR. 
Je tiens à cette occasion à saluer l’action de Jean-Marie Levaux qui a récemment quitté ses 
fonctions à l’issue de son mandat de vice-président.  
Au cours de ses cinq années d’existence, l’ACPR, autorité administrative indépendante 
adossée à la Banque de France, a fédéré les cultures issues des autorités d’agrément et de 
contrôle des secteurs de la banque et de l’assurance et développé ses nouvelles missions 
tant dans le domaine de la protection de la clientèle que de la résolution. Elle a su évoluer 
pour s’intégrer dans le nouveau paysage européen de la supervision. 
En s’appuyant sur les  agents de son secrétariat général – un peu plus de mille -, la 
complémentarité de ses cinq collèges et sur sa Commission des sanctions, l’ACPR a 
progressé sur l’ensemble des grandes missions que lui a confié le législateur. 
Pour contribuer à la stabilité du système financier, l’ACPR mène trois types d’actions. 
Elle délivre les agréments et autorisations nécessaires à l’exercice de l’activité bancaire ou 
d’assurance. Elle assure la surveillance permanente des institutions soumises à son contrôle 
et elle veille à l’élaboration et à la mise en œuvre des mesures nécessaires pour prévenir et 
résoudre les crises financières. L’année 2014 a été une année-clef. Dans le domaine 
bancaire, elle a vu l’entrée en vigueur des textes européens et nationaux transposant les 
accords de Bâle III,  la mise en place concrète du mécanisme de supervision unique, le 
MSU, sous l’égide de la BCE et l’adoption du nouveau cadre européen de résolution. Dans 
le domaine des assurances, elle a constitué une nouvelle étape dans les transformations qui 
précèdent l’entrée en vigueur de Solvabilité II. 
Pour protéger la clientèle, le Secrétariat général de l’ACPR a continué de mobiliser au 
cours de l’année 2014 des équipes de contrôle pluridisciplinaires. La protection de la 
clientèle a été au cœur de plusieurs décisions très commentées de la Commission des 
sanctions, notamment à propos des contrats d’assurance vie en déshérence, point que 
développera Rémi Bouchez, le Président de cette commission, dans quelques instants. 
Pour représenter la supervision française et son expertise sur les scènes 
internationale et européenne, l’ACPR a continué de participer à plus de 250 groupes de 
 1/9 
   
travail européens et internationaux qui discutent des évolutions juridiques, des pratiques de 
supervision et de la prise en compte des risques qui pèsent sur les institutions soumises à 
son contrôle. 
Afin de présenter ce rapport d’activité, je commenterai les progrès de l’intégration 
européenne de la supervision bancaire et l’évolution de l’ACPR dans ce cadre. Puis je 
soulignerai, dans le secteur de l’assurance, le renforcement des actions de supervision et 
l’aboutissement des efforts de préparation à Solvabilité II. Enfin, je reviendrai sur les 
résultats des deux secteurs avant de dresser quelques perspectives pour l’action de l’ACPR 
en 2015. Ensuite, Rémi Bouchez présentera l’activité de la Commission des sanctions. 
I – La dimension européenne de la supervision s’est fortement renforcée en 2014 
L’année 2014 s’est avérée une étape-clef dans le renforcement du caractère européen 
de la supervision bancaire. 
Sur le plan de la réglementation nous avons eu la mise en place d’un nouveau cadre  
commun pour la supervision bancaire issu des accords internationaux dits de « Bale III » et 
l’adoption d’un régime commun de résolution. 
Sur le plan des institutions, l’Union Bancaire est devenue une réalité avec le démarrage 
effectif du Mécanisme de supervision unique et le lancement du Mécanisme de résolution 
unique. 
Ce sont des sujets que vous connaissez bien mais il me faut y revenir tant ils vont structurer 
nos activités dans l’avenir. 
Le nouveau cadre commun de supervision bancaire c’est d’abord, comme je l’évoquais en 
introduction, le « paquet CRD IV », incluant la directive dite « CRD4 » et le règlement dit 
« CRR »,  entré en vigueur au 1er janvier 2014. Au-delà de ces textes dits de niveau 1, la 
Commission Européenne a également adopté, sur proposition de l’Autorité Bancaire 
Européenne, les actes délégués précisant les modalités de mise en œuvre effective du ratio 
de levier et du ratio de liquidité à court terme (LCR). Nous disposons donc d’un référentiel de 
supervision bancaire presque complet, beaucoup plus exigeant que le précédent. Il a  
suscité un certain nombre de réserves qui doivent, je crois, être relativisées. Je voudrais 
aujourd’hui en évoquer deux : d’abord le fait qu’il ait été jugé significativement non conforme 
aux prescriptions de Bale III et ensuite le fait qu’il laisse une part non négligeable aux options 
nationales. 
Le jugement négatif porté par le Comité de Bâle sur la déclinaison européenne de Bale III ne 
doit pas être surestimé ; il découle en effet du traitement plus favorable que nous avons 
accordé au financement des PME ainsi que d’exemptions accordées au bénéfice 
d’exposition sur certaines contreparties non-financières dans les opérations sur instruments 
dérivés et sur opérations de financement sur titres non compensées avec une contrepartie 
centrale (CVA). Le premier traduit un choix économique de favoriser le financement des 
PME et le second verra son importance se réduire avec le développement des opérations 
compensées avec une contrepartie centrale. 
Le débat sur la pertinence des options nationales a resurgi l’an passé à l’occasion du stress 
test de l’ABE et du « Comprehensive Assessement » de la BCE. Il est d’abord nourri par les 
choix différents faits par les pays membres concernant le rythme de mise en œuvre de 
certains traitements de la CRR et qui ne permet pas de comparer directement les données 
de 2014 des différentes banques. Ces mesures transitoires vont s’éteindre d’elles-mêmes, la 
plupart en 2018, et la comparabilité des données est assurée par la publication, en plus des 
 2/9 
   
données réglementaires de données calculées en fonction du régime cible (full CRD4/CRR). 
Plus complexe est le sujet des options nationales dites permanentes, qui ont vocation à 
prendre en compte des différences structurelles dans les circuits de l’épargne. La France est 
de ce point de vue concernée par son circuit de l’épargne réglementée autour du livret A et 
par l’importance de la banque-assurance qui correspond au continuum des produits 
d’épargne des ménages français. Il est clair que des situations équivalentes doivent être 
traitées de façon identique en Europe et tout particulièrement au sein de l’Union bancaire, 
mais il est également clair que la réglementation bancaire n’a pas pour vocation à se 
déployer au détriment direct de circuits d’épargne éprouvés ou de la bonne capitalisation des 
autres intermédiaires financiers. Je vous rappelle d’ailleurs qu’au-delà de la surveillance en 
silo des intermédiaires, nous appelons de nos vœux un renforcement de l’approche des 
conglomérats financiers. 
La seconde avancée réglementaire majeure consiste en la finalisation du cadre commun 
européen de résolution des banques avec la directive BRRD. La France avait largement 
anticipé cette réglementation avec sa loi de juillet 2013 et l’ajout d’une responsabilité de 
Résolution à l’ACP, mais il reste un important exercice de transposition en droit français à 
faire notamment pour mettre en œuvre l’utilisation de dettes non subordonnées pour couvrir 
des pertes (« bail-in »). D’une manière plus générale, il faut pouvoir coordonner au mieux le 
dispositif européen avec les futurs standards internationaux en matière d’absorption des 
pertes (TLAC).   
Au-delà des avancées réglementaires, l’autre évènement majeur, c‘est bien évidemment le 4 
novembre 2014, date à laquelle le MSU est devenu pleinement opérationnel au sein de la 
zone euro. Dans les faits, la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) s’est dotée de quatre 
nouvelles directions générales dédiées à la supervision bancaire, et d’un Conseil de 
surveillance prudentiel où siègent les représentants des autorités nationales, comme 
l’ACPR. La mise en place de cet ensemble, regroupant les autorités nationales et la BCE en 
un système unifié de supervision, vient désormais garantir l’homogénéité des pratiques 
de supervision dans la zone euro, ce qui constitue une avancée majeure, tant pour 
accompagner l’intégration financière de la zone monétaire, que pour assurer la solidité du 
système bancaire européen.  
Depuis cette date, la BCE assure la supervision directe des 123 groupes bancaires 
jugés « importants » (parfois désignés par l’adjectif anglais « significant »), ainsi que des 
4 900 entités qui composent ces groupes. Cette désignation des banques importantes se 
fonde notamment sur leur taille, leur poids dans l’économie de l’Union ou d’un État membre, 
ou encore sur l’intensité de leurs activités transfrontalières. Cette supervision directe de la 
BCE, appuyée par les équipes locales des autorités nationales, s’opère au sein « d’équipes 
conjointes de contrôle » (ou « joint supervisory teams » – JST) sur lesquelles je reviendrai 
dans un instant. Par opposition à ces banques « importantes », les quelques 3 500 banques 
dites « moins importantes » demeurent quant à elles sous la supervision directe des 
autorités de contrôle nationales, la BCE exerçant un contrôle indirect sur ces entités, 
toujours dans une optique d’harmonisation des pratiques de supervision. 
Le lancement du MSU a été précédé d’un exercice inédit et ambitieux d’évaluation 
complète des bilans de 130 groupes européens dont les 13 principaux groupes 
bancaires français, incluant une phase de revue de la qualité des actifs détenus par ces 
établissements (Asset Quality Review – AQR), suivie d’une phase de tests de résistance de 
ces établissements à des scénarios de chocs (stress-tests). Cet exercice a très largement 
mobilisé les équipes de l’ACPR en 2014 et a requis le soutien de cabinets externes. Je tiens 
à nouveau à adresser mes remerciements pour l’implication exceptionnelle dont ont 
su faire preuve toutes les parties prenantes à cet exercice. Jusqu’à 800 personnes ont 
 3/9 
   
été mobilisées à certaines périodes pour la réalisation de ce projet hors normes qui a 
nécessité un total de plus de 50 000 jours/homme. Ces moyens considérables ont permis de 
réaliser un audit approfondi des 120 portefeuilles de crédit les plus significatifs, couvrant 
ainsi plus de la moitié des risques de crédit des groupes bancaires inspectés. 
Sur la base de ces bilans « passés au peigne fin », des scénarios de stress ont pu être 
testés afin de s’assurer de la résistance du système bancaire européen à des chocs 
macroéconomiques défavorables. Ces stress-tests ont été conduits selon une 
méthodologie commune élaborée par les autorités de supervision nationales et l’Autorité 
bancaire européenne (ABE) en s’appuyant sur des scénarios établis par le Conseil Européen 
du Risque Systémique (CERS). Deux scénarios ont été appliqués : un « scénario de 
référence », et un « scénario défavorable » particulièrement sévère. Partant d’un niveau 
agrégé de ratio de fonds propres de base de catégorie 1 (CET1), après prise en compte 
de l’AQR, de 11,3% à fin 2013, le ratio des banques françaises revenait à 9% à l’horizon 
2016 dans le scénario défavorable pour le référentiel CRD4 avec mesures transitoires, 
et à 8,6% en référentiel CRD4 complet, soit bien au-dessus des moyennes européennes. 
Lors de la publication des résultats de ces stress-tests par la BCE, le 26 octobre dernier, 
aucune banque française n’a dû fournir un plan de recapitalisation. Ces bons résultats 
confortent le modèle universel des banques françaises et montrent que la diversification de 
leurs activités, associée à une gestion rigoureuse des risques, est un atout précieux 
permettant d’afficher des bilans solides et des capacités prouvées de résistance à des chocs 
sévères.  
II – L’activité de l’ACPR a su évoluer au sein de cet environnement en mutation 
Afin de prendre place au sein du mécanisme de supervision unique européen et d’y jouer 
pleinement son rôle, l’ACPR a dû revoir en partie son organisation. La séparation entre le 
contrôle sur pièces et le contrôle sur place a été adoptée par le MSU sur un modèle proche 
de la pratique en vigueur à l’ACPR. En revanche, la mise en place des « équipes 
conjointes de contrôle » (les « JST ») que j’évoquais précédemment a conduit l’ACPR à 
adapter les portefeuilles de ses services de contrôle sur pièces. 
En effet, jusqu’à récemment, certaines filiales de grands groupes bancaires étaient 
regroupées et suivies par des services de contrôle spécialisés sur certaines activités. A 
l’inverse, la logique retenue par le MSU consiste à privilégier l’appartenance des entités à un 
même groupe. Ainsi, une JST est donc formée pour chacun des 123 groupes bancaires 
désormais directement sous la supervision de la BCE. Cette nouvelle logique a entraîné 
une réallocation de portefeuilles entre les services de contrôle sur pièces de l’ACPR, afin de 
permettre la mise en place de ces JST et de faire en sorte que l’Autorité soit pleinement 
opérationnelle dans le mécanisme européen.  
Comme je l’indiquais, la conduite de l’évaluation complète des bilans a largement mobilisé 
les équipes de contrôle bancaire, sur place comme sur pièces, jusqu’au mois de septembre 
2014, date à laquelle le programme de contrôle défini par le Collège de supervision de 
l’ACPR a pu reprendre. Les priorités de celui-ci ont notamment porté sur les activités de 
marché et la préparation des établissements à la mise en œuvre de la loi de séparation des 
activités bancaires. Au sein des établissements, les structures responsables du suivi des 
risques et les dispositifs de contrôle interne ont été examinés. Enfin, le pilotage du risque 
global de taux d’intérêt a fait l’objet d’un suivi attentif par les équipes de contrôle.  
L’année 2014 a également connu divers changements relatifs au statut des entités du 
secteur bancaire. À ce titre, la directive CRD IV a notamment restreint la définition des 
établissements de crédit, conduisant l’ACPR à mettre en place un nouveau statut de 
 4/9 
   
« société de financement » dès fin 2013. Au cours de l’année écoulée, pas moins de 134 
entités ont opté pour ce nouveau type d’agrément. Par ailleurs, deux nouveaux statuts 
de « conseiller en investissement participatif » et « d’intermédiaire en financement 
participatif » ont été créés afin de favoriser l’essor du financement participatif (ou 
« crowdfunding »), tout en apportant davantage de sécurité juridique pour les particuliers en 
précisant les obligations de ces nouveaux acteurs. 
Le contrôle exercé par l’ACPR en 2014 en matière de protection de la clientèle a de nouveau 
porté sur le respect du droit au compte et s’est également focalisé sur les problématiques 
relatives au crédit renouvelable, au crédit affecté ainsi qu’au regroupement de crédits. Mais 
l’accent a aussi été mis sur la formation des professionnels, identifiée comme l’un des 
principaux leviers d’amélioration de la protection du consommateur. Dans ce cadre, l’ACPR 
a pris part, à la demande de l’Éducation nationale, à la refonte du BTS banque 
« conseiller clientèle » afin que les thématiques liées à l’inclusion bancaire, au traitement 
des clientèles sensibles et à l’absence de pratiques commerciales déloyales, soient 
naturellement intégrées dans le programme de formation. 
Enfin, l’ACPR a maintenu son action de lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le 
financement du terrorisme. Dans un contexte où les attentes en la matière vis-à-vis du 
système financier ne peuvent que se renforcer, l’ACPR insiste auprès de tous les acteurs du 
secteur bancaire, comme auprès des organismes d’assurance vie, sur la nécessité de mettre 
en place ou de conforter des dispositifs internes de contrôle efficaces pour contrer ces 
risques. 
III – Dans le secteur des assurances, l’ACPR a renforcé ses efforts de supervision et a 
accompagné les changements réglementaires 
122 décisions d’agrément ou d’autorisation ont été prises par l’ACPR dans le secteur des 
assurances. Ce chiffre important s’explique notamment par la préparation de Solvabilité II 
dont l’approche a contribué à la poursuite de la concentration des organismes soumis au 
Code de la mutualité et, plus largement, à une rationalisation des groupes autour de 
structures reconnues comme groupes prudentiels. Cette évolution devrait se poursuivre en 
2015. 
Le contrôle permanent a poursuivi ses efforts qui permettent d’assurer un suivi régulier et 
approfondi des organismes assujettis au contrôle de l’ACPR. 97,1 % des organismes dont 
le chiffre d’affaires est supérieur à 5 millions d’euros ont fait l’objet d’une évaluation 
complète de leur profil de risques. La surveillance complémentaire des groupes s’est 
aussi renforcée en prévision de Solvabilité II, s’appuyant, pour les groupes internationaux, 
sur les 15 collèges de superviseurs qu’anime l’ACPR. Plus de 90 missions sur place ont 
permis d’aller vérifier, dans les organismes, le respect de la réglementation mais aussi, et 
c’était l’un des tous premiers objectifs de l’année, suivre leur préparation à Solvabilité II, 
qu’ils aient entrepris le développement d’un modèle interne de mesure du risque, ou qu’ils 
utilisent la formule de base dite « standard ». 
Enfin le contrôle des pratiques commerciales a mené des actions diversifiées. Tout en 
poursuivant sa veille sur les contrats et les publicités, la Direction du contrôle des pratiques 
commerciales a mené des contrôles sur pièce et sur place, auprès des organismes et des 
intermédiaires sur certaines thématiques prioritaires. Il s’agit notamment du devoir de 
conseil, des modalités de gestion des assurances de protection juridique et du 
fonctionnement de l’assurance emprunteur dans le cadre du respect de la convention dite 
AERAS. 
 5/9 
   
Ces actions de supervision classiques ont été complétées par d’autres outils comme les 
tests de résistances, ou stress-tests, réalisés sous l’égide de l’EIOPA. À l’occasion de ces 
tests, nous souhaitions éprouver la solidité et identifier les faiblesses éventuelles des 
assureurs français et européens, mais aussi, encore une fois, vérifier la compatibilité de 
leurs profils avec une mesure des risques prudentiels proche du cadre de Solvabilité II. Les 
résultats publiés le 30 novembre 2014 sont très encourageants. Les onze groupes français 
participant respectent le capital de solvabilité requis (SCR) en situation de base, alors 
que 14 % des groupes européens n’y parviennent pas. Parmi les conclusions, nous retenons 
que le scénario d’une chute des marchés actions aurait sur les groupes français un impact 
comparable à celui observé sur leurs homologues européens. Enfin, comme je l’évoquais à 
l’instant, un exercice complémentaire dit « satellite » a permis de tester de manière 
exploratoire l’impact qu’aurait une persistance de l’environnement de taux bas. 
Les mesures visant les groupes d’assurance d’importance systémique mondiale ont 
constitué un autre axe innovant d’action de l’ACPR au cours de l’année 2014. Comme 
superviseur du groupe (pour AXA) ou comme superviseur de filiales notables (pour Allianz, 
Aviva et Generali), l’ACPR a participé aux réunions régulières des « groupes de gestion de 
crise » (CMG en anglais) chargés de coordonner la supervision de ces groupes et de valider 
leurs plans de redressement et de résolution. 
Les principales évolutions réglementaires de l’année ont porté sur l’assurance vie. 
La loi relative aux comptes bancaires inactifs et aux contrats d’assurance vie en déshérence, 
dite loi Eckert, du 13 juin 2014, a fixé de nouvelles obligations aux organismes et a renforcé 
les pouvoirs de l’ACPR afin de mettre un terme à la question des contrats d’assurance vie 
non réclamés qui a donné lieu cette année à trois décisions de la Commission des sanctions. 
En 2015, l’ACPR s’assurera que les assureurs mettent effectivement en application les plans 
d’action conduisant au versement des capitaux aux bénéficiaires. 
À la suite du rapport de la mission parlementaire Berger-Lefebvre, et afin d’améliorer le 
financement de l’économie, de nouveaux supports et contrats d’assurance vie ont été mis 
sur le marché en 2014. Ces nouveaux produits, dits « euro-croissance » et « vie-
génération » ont été conçus afin que se développent des produits d’assurance vie 
contribuant davantage aux fonds propres des entreprises non financières. Les supports 
euro-croissance comportent une garantie en euros à l’échéance et des parts de provision de 
diversification. Ils nécessitent donc une attention particulière tant d’un point de vue prudentiel 
que d’un point de vue de contrôle des pratiques commerciales. L’ACPR suivra donc de près 
le développement de ces nouveaux produits qui reste en tout état de cause modéré dans la 
période de très bas taux actuels qui ne permet pas de dégager des marges importantes de 
diversification tout en assurant une garantie en capital à un horizon raisonnable. 
Mais, bien entendu, le principal enjeu réglementaire est resté la préparation de Solvabilité II. 
IV - Au cours de l’année 2014, les organismes d’assurance et l’ACPR ont réalisé des 
progrès décisifs dans la préparation de l’entrée en vigueur des dispositions de 
Solvabilité II 
Ces progrès ont été rendus possibles par l’adoption de la directive Omnibus II par le 
Parlement européen et le Conseil en mars 2014. Ce texte a amendé la directive originale 
et a introduit de nombreuses dispositions qui, notamment, facilitent la mise en œuvre de 
Solvabilité II : le principe d’une application le 1er janvier 2016 et la mise en place de règles 
spécifiques, notamment celles s’appliquant aux activités dites « branches longues ». Tout au 
long de l’année 2014, l’EIOPA puis la Commission ont travaillé sur les actes délégués (les 
« textes de niveau 2 ») qui ont été publiés en janvier 2015. Dans cette dernière ligne droite, 
 6/9 
   
des voix s’élèvent pour remettre en cause tel ou tel aspect de cette réglementation : 
pondérations accordées à tel ou tel type d’actifs, horizon annuel de calcul des risques, règles 
de gouvernance … aucune réglementation n’est parfaite, et  toute réglementation a vocation 
à être régulièrement revue et amendée, mais il est désormais temps de mettre en œuvre ce 
qui a été décidé. 
Tout au long de l’année 2014, l’ACPR a multiplié les actions pour accompagner les 
organismes dans leurs efforts de préparation à Solvabilité II. 
Deux conférences ont été organisées avec la profession, une en juin et l’autre en 
décembre, et de nombreuses réunions techniques ont eu lieu tout au long de l’année entre 
les services de l’ACPR et les représentants de la profession. En outre, la préparation à 
Solvabilité II était en 2014, et reste en 2015, l’une des priorités majeures dans le cadre 
du contrôle des organismes concernés. 
L’ACPR a également fait le choix de tirer parti de l’ensemble des occasions offertes par 
le calendrier pour inscrire dans le concret cette préparation. 
À côté de leurs obligations au titre de Solvabilité I, les organismes concernés par Solvabilité 
II ont ainsi, en 2014, calculé des provisions et remis des états prudentiels selon les 
règles de Solvabilité II. Environ la moitié des 400 organismes participants ont été en mesure 
d’utiliser dès à présent le format électronique de remise qui sera la norme des remises 
prudentielles sous Solvabilité II.  
Les organismes ont enfin rédigé et remis une version pilote des rapports d’évaluation interne 
des risques et de la solvabilité, les rapports « ORSA » pour les désigner par leur acronyme 
anglais. 
Le bilan de la préparation à Solvabilité II, dressé par l’ACPR à la suite d’une enquête, a 
confirmé cette nette progression mais a toutefois permis de souligner la nécessité de 
poursuivre les efforts entrepris, notamment pour progresser sur les travaux de 
communication d’informations au public et au superviseur, questions dites du « pilier 
3 ». Les évolutions de la gouvernance, dites « pilier 2 » doivent aussi faire l’objet d’une 
attention renforcée et poursuivie de la part des organismes. 
L’analyse au niveau agrégé des données Solvabilité II remises par les organismes et les 
résultats de cette enquête sont disponibles dans la série d’« analyses et synthèses » dans 
laquelle sont publiés les travaux de l’ACPR. 
V – Le secteur bancaire français et le secteur de l’assurance ont démontré leur solidité 
en 2014 
En 2014, les six principaux groupes bancaires français ont dégagé un résultat net part du 
groupe (RNPG) de 14,3 milliards d’euros, en baisse de 20 % par rapport à 2013. Toutefois, 
celui-ci s’est vu affecté par divers éléments exceptionnels d’ampleur assez conséquente, 
notamment le règlement de l’amende de BNP Paribas imposée par les autorités 
américaines.  
Hors prise en compte de ces éléments exceptionnels, on constate une légère hausse de la 
rentabilité qui provient à la fois d’une progression du produit net bancaire (PNB) de 1,8 % qui 
a dépassé celle des charges d’exploitation (+1 %), et d’une contraction du coût du risque de 
près de 18 %. 
Ces résultats viennent conforter davantage la situation de solvabilité des banques 
françaises, déjà satisfaisante comme l’ont démontré les résultats de l’AQR et des stress-
 7/9 
   
tests que je vous rappelais à l’instant. La situation en termes de levier est également 
correcte dans la mesure où tous les grands établissements de la place ont publié des 
ratios de levier supérieurs au seuil de 3% préconisé par le Comité de Bâle. Il en va de 
même pour la situation en matière de liquidité puisque tous les établissements ont publié des 
ratios de court terme (LCR) supérieurs à la norme de 100 %.  
Ces améliorations interviennent dans un contexte où divers risques ont pesé en 2014, et 
pèsent encore à ce jour, sur le système financier, nécessitant une vigilance 
particulière. Je pense en particulier à la volatilité observée sur les marchés dans un 
contexte où leur liquidité est dans bien des cas limitée, ainsi qu’au contexte de très bas taux 
d’intérêt de marché en euros sur l’ensemble de la courbe. Cette configuration de taux réduit 
mécaniquement les marges bancaires mais a un effet d’autant plus sensible en France que 
la baisse du coût des ressources ne touche pas l’épargne réglementée et que les 
renégociations de crédits à l’habitat à taux fixe se multiplient. Ceci affecte particulièrement 
les marges de l’activité bancaire de détail et incite à réduire les coûts de collecte.  
La vigilance reste donc de mise pour cette année 2015 et l’ACPR saura faire preuve d’une 
attention particulière vis-à-vis de ces risques, ainsi que sur ceux qui émergent, comme le 
développement de la cybercriminalité. 
S’agissant du marché français de l’assurance, en 2014, il a connu, d’une part, une 
confirmation du redressement des primes et cotisations, tant en assurance de 
personnes qu’en assurance de biens et responsabilités, et d’autre part une assez grande 
stabilité des prestations.  
Cette évolution est surtout sensible pour l’assurance vie. Ainsi, d’après les chiffres de 
l’ACPR, sur les seuls supports rachetables, la collecte nette s’est élevée à plus de 19,5 
milliards d’euros après 12 milliards en 2013. Au sein de celle-ci, la collecte nette en unités de 
compte (UC) s’est élevée à près de 6 milliards d’euros en 2014. Elle se poursuit d’ailleurs à 
un rythme plus important encore depuis le début de l’année et a atteint près de 4 milliards 
d’euros au premier trimestre 2015. 
Les principaux groupes d’assurance actifs en France ont publié des résultats en 
progression : les bonnes performances du compte technique sont confortées par des 
résultats financiers en hausse, et le stock de plus-values latentes des assureurs s’est 
encore accru en 2014. 
Concernant les résultats financiers, il faut noter que la baisse des taux d’intérêt a 
mécaniquement accru les plus-values latentes sur leurs placements antérieurs. En revanche, 
à moyen terme, le contexte de taux bas que nous traversons induit des risques pour le 
secteur de l’assurance. L’aplatissement de la courbe des taux entraine en effet une baisse 
progressive et durable du rendement des actifs, ce qui pénalise tout particulièrement les 
assureurs vie. Ces derniers seraient également négativement impactés par une remontée 
brutale des taux, si elle devait avoir lieu, car une telle situation les exposerait à la fois à une 
dépréciation de la valeur de marché de leurs actifs à taux fixe et à un risque de décollecte 
importante, conduisant alors les établissements à céder des actifs en moins-values latentes. 
De tels scénarios ont fait l’objet d’analyses de la part de l’ACPR et de l’Autorité Européenne 
des Assurances et des Pensions Professionnelles (en anglais, EIOPA). Celles-ci ont montré 
que, même si la situation actuelle ne constitue pas une menace immédiate pour les 
organismes d’assurance, une vigilance s’impose quant à la qualité des placements 
réalisés et les taux offerts aux épargnants en assurance vie, comme je l’ai souligné à de 
nombreuses reprises ces derniers mois. 
 8/9 
   
Comme vous avez pu le constater, l’actualité de l’ACPR a été particulièrement chargée en 
2014 et de nombreux chantiers l’attendent encore pour cette année 2015. 
L’année 2015 sera sous de multiples aspects marquée par cette thématique de la résolution. 
Quelques ajustements du droit français sont nécessaires pour finaliser la transposition de la 
directive BRRD. Par ailleurs, l’Union européenne a adopté en même temps que la directive 
un règlement  qui instaure un Conseil de résolution unique (CRU), lequel exerce ses 
compétences dans le cadre du mécanisme de résolution unique, deuxième pilier de l’Union 
bancaire. Siégeant à Bruxelles et opérationnel depuis cette année, il est notamment chargé 
d’établir et adopter les plans de résolution des groupes qui relèvent du MRU, dont font partie 
tous ceux considérés comme importants dans le cadre du MSU.  
En outre, au-delà du cadre européen, des discussions internationales se poursuivent, 
notamment afin de renforcer encore davantage la capacité d’absorption des pertes des 
établissements systémiques (en anglais « total loss absorbency capacity » - TLAC). 
Dans le secteur des assurances, la préparation à Solvabilité II s’achève. 
Tous les états prudentiels au format Solvabilité II seront remis sous forme électronique via le 
portail unique et sécurisé qui a été testé en 2014. Au 15 juillet, seront collectées les 
premières remises annuelles consolidées selon le périmètre des groupes prudentiels. À 
partir de l’échéance du 30 septembre 2015, des états trimestriels viendront s’ajouter aux 
remises annuelles. Ils seront remis avant le 25 novembre pour les données individuelles. 
Enfin, les rapports « ORSA » individuels et groupes devront être transmis à l’ACPR pour le 
18 septembre au plus tard. 
L’ACPR devra en outre se prononcer sur de nombreuses procédures d’autorisation au 
cours de l’année en cours. Il s’agit de permettre l’usage d’un modèle interne, de 
paramètres propres à l’organisme ou de régimes transitoires. L’autorité pourra s’appuyer sur 
le dialogue et les échanges réalisés en 2014 afin de traiter dans les meilleures conditions 
ces demandes avant l’entrée en vigueur effective de la directive. 
Face à ces multiples échéances qui s’annoncent, je ne doute pas que les organismes et les 
agents de l’ACPR sauront travailler de concert pour atteindre ces objectifs. 
Enfin, dans la ligne des années précédentes, l’ACPR restera fortement mobilisée en 2015 
dans les très nombreux groupes de travail européens et internationaux auxquels elle prend 
une part active. Présents dans 255 groupes et sous-groupes, et présidant 24 d’entre eux, 
les représentants de l’ACPR sont reconnus pour leur expertise et pour leur implication dans 
la préparation des futures réglementations, que ce soit dans le domaine de la banque, de 
l’assurance, ou encore de la protection de la clientèle.  
Je cède maintenant la parole à Rémi Bouchez, président de la Commission des sanctions de 
l’ACPR, qui va vous présenter l’activité disciplinaire récente de l’Autorité. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence Paris Europlace - 7 juillet 2015  
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
  
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un grand  plaisir pour moi que d’être ici aujourd’hui dans le cadre du Forum international  Paris 
Europlace et je suis particulièrement heureux de pouvoir échanger des points de vue sur le projet 
d’Union des marchés de capitaux (UMC) avec l’un de ses principaux architectes, Olivier Guersent. 
Ce projet fait effectivement écho à de nombreuses préoccupations traitées au niveau des banques 
centrales,  relatives en particulier aux moyens de parvenir à un meilleur équilibre de la structure de 
financement de l’économie et d’améliorer l’accès au financement des entreprises, notamment en ce qui 
concerne les PME et les infrastructures, tout en garantissant la stabilité financière. Cette initiative, 
annoncée il y a seulement un an,  est rapidement devenue un sujet d’actualité avec le lancement de la 
consultation publique par la Commission européenne en février dernier. 
La Banque de France s’est engagée à répondre à cette consultation publique, qui constitue une étape 
importante de la construction d'une Union des marchés de capitaux. Permettez-moi de vous présenter 
brièvement notre point de vue. 
Je salue et je soutiens l’initiative pour la mise en place d’une Union des marchés de capitaux (UMC) et 
la considère comme une voie prometteuse vers la croissance. Toutefois, je crois que trois conditions 
préalables majeures doivent être réunies pour assurer son succès : un cadre clairement défini axé sur 
un nombre limité de résultats opérationnels, (b) un dosage approprié entre financement de marché et 
financement bancaire ; (c) la nécessité d'assurer la stabilité financière à long terme. 
a) Premièrement, l’Union des marchés de capitaux doit être structurée à l’aide d’un cadre 
clairement défini et énoncé, et être axée sur un nombre limité de résultats opérationnels.  
Nous estimons qu’en matière de financement à long terme, il faut, en toute priorité, chercher à 
promouvoir le financement par émission d’actions plutôt que le financement par endettement. Le 
financement par émission d’actions est essentiel pour permettre aux entreprises de se développer et de 
 
2 
 
fonctionner à long terme, d’autant plus que nous devons tenir compte du niveau élevé d’endettement 
en Europe, aussi bien s’agissant du secteur public que du secteur privé, y compris  pour les PME 
emprunteuses.  Il faut en effet que les ratios d’endettement actuels soient ajustés pour s’inscrire sur 
une trajectoire plus soutenable.  
En dépit de cet objectif prioritaire, les instruments de dette demeurent un outil de financement 
indispensable. S’agissant des résultats opérationnels, nous partageons l’opinion de la Commission 
européenne selon laquelle le développement de placements privés et d’une titrisation simple, 
transparente et standardisée (STS)  est possible à court ou moyen terme.  
La titrisation peut en effet constituer un outil pertinent au service du financement de l'économie 
puisqu'elle permet de libérer du capital réglementaire et de créer des actifs liquides, en particulier dans 
le contexte d’un durcissement des exigences de fonds propres imposées aux banques. L’UMC pourrait 
par exemple  promouvoir des initiatives comme celles qui ont été menées en France, où les banques, 
avec le soutien de la Banque de France, ont pris des mesures pour monétiser leurs gisements de 
créances privées. Les banques ont désormais la possibilité de structurer ces prêts sous la forme de 
titres négociables (ESN), émis par un véhicule de titrisation, l’Euro Secured Note Issuer (ESNI), pour 
lever des fonds à moyen terme. 
S’agissant des placements privés, les initiatives de place ont déjà permis le développement effectif de 
normes européennes communes. Le secteur financier français a été particulièrement actif dans ce 
domaine, avec l’élaboration de la Charte Euro PP (Placements privés) pour la France en 2014. Cette 
Charte a été réutilisée par l’Association des marchés de capitaux internationaux (ou International 
Capital Market Association, ICMA) pour rédiger un guide sur les normes  de marché  et les meilleures 
pratiques communes. Ces initiatives ont pu s’appuyer sur une définition et une classification 
européenne communes des PME pour développer un marché paneuropéen des placements privés. 
b) Deuxièmement, le financement de marché doit être considéré en complément et non en 
remplacement du financement bancaire.  
Il est essentiel de favoriser le développement du financement de marché en complément du 
financement bancaire. Bien que cette évolution soit déjà commencée, sa vitesse et son ampleur sont 
variables selon les pays et les secteurs considérés. Même si un rééquilibrage du dosage de financement 
de l’économie européenne est souhaitable, dans la mesure où il favorise la diversification des sources 
de financement disponibles, les banques continueront cependant de jouer un rôle majeur.  
 
Certains compartiments de l’économie, à savoir les PME et les infrastructures, dépendent fortement du 
financement bancaire, en raison de l’existence de coûts fixes élevés et d’asymétries d’information 
 
3 
 
importantes. Les banques sont en effet mieux armées pour évaluer la solvabilité de ces contreparties 
ou de ces projets. 
 
Cela dit, la fourniture d’informations claires et transparentes sur le risque de crédit est une condition 
préalable au recours à toute source de financement, qu’elle soit intermédiée ou non. Le plan d’action 
pour l’UMC doit prévoir des initiatives favorisant des solutions impliquant le secteur privé, telles que 
l’utilisation plus large des outils de notation existants. 
 
Les investisseurs doivent également avoir accès à des informations comptables claires, comparables et 
complètes, dont la plupart des PME en Europe sont actuellement dépourvues. Les règles comptables 
constituant le fondement de l’information financière, une Union des marchés de capitaux ne peut être 
efficace avec 28 systèmes comptables différents. Cela est d’autant plus important dans l’Union 
bancaire européenne, où les banques supervisées par l’Autorité bancaire européenne dans le cadre du 
Mécanisme de surveillance unique (MSU) demeurent soumises à des systèmes comptables différents. 
Des progrès sont hautement souhaitables dans ce domaine et, à titre de première étape, je serais 
favorable à une initiative visant à évaluer la qualité et le degré de comparabilité des normes 
comptables nationales et à promouvoir la poursuite de la convergence. 
 
c) Troisièmement, il demeure nécessaire de garantir la stabilité financière à long terme.  
L’évolution vers davantage de financement de marché entraînerait plusieurs conséquences du point de 
vue de la stabilité financière. 
 
Le développement de sources de financement alternatives, extérieures au système bancaire, apporte 
une nécessaire diversification. Cependant, les risques associés à la désintermédiation sont clairs, 
notamment une évaluation limitée des risques par les investisseurs ou une moindre capacité à gérer les 
situations difficiles et certaines lacunes dans la supervision. En parallèle, la réintermédiation non 
bancaire soulève des questions d’égalité de traitement liées au manque d’uniformité de la 
réglementation et de la surveillance d’un secteur ou d’un pays à l’autre. 
 
Les objectifs de l’Union des marchés de capitaux doivent servir de base aux efforts réglementaires 
réalisés au niveau européen. Avant d’adopter de nouveaux textes législatifs, il est primordial 
d’examiner leur incidence de manière approfondie. Même si l’analyse de l’incidence cumulée des 
réglementations et de leurs interactions n’a commencé que depuis peu, il convient d’être vigilant afin 
de garantir que la mise en œuvre des réformes n’aboutisse pas à une réduction des activités 
financières, telles que la tenue de marché, qui sont indispensables pour préserver la liquidité de 
marché, financer les investissements et les entreprises et, au final, l’économie réelle.   
 
 
4 
 
La réforme prévue des structures bancaires et la future taxe sur les transactions financières dans 
l’Union européenne (European Financial Transactions Tax – EFTT) sont deux bons exemples à cet 
égard. Dans ces deux projets, une démarche appropriée doit permettre d’atteindre un juste équilibre 
entre la limitation des risques associés aux activités de marché et la nécessité de préserver les activités 
financières utiles, voire même essentielles, au développement de l’économie réelle. Cette approche 
serait pleinement compatible avec les objectifs fondamentaux de l’Union des marchés de capitaux. 
Une meilleure intégration des marchés au sein de l’Union européenne (UE) signifierait également 
l’apparition de nouveaux enjeux de réciprocité en matière de politiques macro-prudentielles. Au 
niveau macroéconomique, les autorités doivent procéder à un examen approfondi des vulnérabilités et 
des risques supplémentaires que l’UMC est susceptible de faire apparaître aussi bien à l’échelle 
nationale qu’au plan transfrontière. Les autorités devront renforcer leur cadre analytique et 
éventuellement compléter leurs instruments macro-prudentiels, principalement issus du secteur 
bancaire au stade actuel. 
Je conclurai par quelques remarques relatives aux travaux à plus long terme, portant sur la 
manière d’harmoniser davantage les régimes juridiques nationaux et l’architecture 
institutionnelle.  
Le Livre vert de la Commission européenne recense les domaines pouvant faire l’objet de travaux à 
plus long terme, comme l’harmonisation des régimes d’insolvabilité, de la législation applicable aux 
titres et des régimes fiscaux. La réalisation de ces objectifs nécessiterait un processus très complexe et 
politiquement sensible. C’est pourquoi nous proposons de commencer par une première étape plus 
réaliste, à savoir un exercice d’évaluation des résultats qui permettra aux investisseurs d’avoir une 
vision plus claire des divergences et des éventuelles incohérences entre les différentes législations des 
États de l’UE.  Il convient également de noter que, dans le domaine des infrastructures de marchés 
financiers, les initiatives de l’Eurosystème se sont avérées de puissants catalyseurs de l’harmonisation. 
Par exemple, des progrès significatifs ont été réalisés en matière de normalisation des décisions des 
entreprises dans le cadre du projet Target2-Titres, sans besoin d’ajuster les différents cadres 
juridiques.  
Enfin, et je sais que c’est un sujet qu’Olivier reprendra avec plaisir, une plus grande convergence 
réglementaire est possible sans modification de l’architecture institutionnelle actuelle, mais grâce à 
une coopération renforcée entre autorités européennes de surveillance (AES) et autorités nationales. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conference for the 20th anniversary of the Banque de France Foundation  
14 September 2015 
 
Opening Speech by Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I will now switch to English, given the international audience and speakers that we are quite 
lucky to have today. I would first of all like to express the great pleasure I have to open this 
conference for the twentieth anniversary of the Banque de France Foundation for Monetary, 
banking and financial economic research.  
I welcome the prominent speakers who made us the honor of joining us today – Yann Algan 
from Sciences Po in Paris and Luigi Zingales from the University of Chicago Booth School of 
Business – and all our chairs and discussants who also are renowned economists in their 
respective fields. 
A few words about the topic of this conference now. The idea of this conference is to take a 
step back and some time to reflect on monetary and financial research in general, and its 
impact on policies and society. We will thus evoke the role of economics and economists 
within our society.  
The two provocative papers discussed today provide a very nice opportunity for such a 
discussion. They both point out several concerns about economic research and finance. 
They highlight the tendencies of economists to be self-referential and analyze how the social 
perception of the finance industry is largely negative nowadays, and the more so since the 
financial crisis. In that respect, the paper focuses on the United States, but there is little 
doubt that France probably is no exception to that rule either.  
 
2 
 
After the 2007-2008 crisis, some first steps have been taken to change incentives in the 
financial industry. And even more should be done in that direction in the coming years. At the 
same time, economists should also adopt a more critical view on the financial industry 
practices and judge them as impartially as possible.  
But what can we say about economists themselves? Are they really too self-referential and 
do they tend to overestimate their role in society? On a personal note – as a policymaker and 
central banker – I do believe it is possible that central bank governors may pay the cost of 
the so-called “superiority” of economists (for instance when they are too sure of their 
econometric models). 
How will we proceed in this conference today? In-depth discussion of papers will be left to 
participants. However, I would like to mention the potential role that the Foundation can play 
to help address some important issues.  
First, economic analysis is definitely needed in order to sharpen policy makers’ 
understanding of the world. At the same time, policy makers should continuously challenge 
the alleged “superiority” of economists with the complexity of the real world.  
Second, actions need to be taken to get academia more involved in policymaking, to bring 
the discipline of theory-based analyses to the policy debates. That implies a better access to 
governmental data for academic researchers, to enable them to conduct independent and 
rigorous research and expose their results to policymakers and the general public, who 
should listen to them in return.  
Well, I hope this is no wishful thinking and I will now leave the floor to our distinguished 
speakers. Thank you. 
***** 
Closing Speech by Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France 
To close today’s conference, I would like to come back to the Foundation and its role. I will 
focus on a brief historical overview of the Foundation for Monetary, banking and financial 
economic research. A lot has been achieved since 1995, as you know. What was our goal? 
To promote excellence in academic research in the field of monetary policy and finance.  
And did we achieve it so far? 
 
3 
 
Well, over three hundred conferences and seminars have been sponsored. The research 
grant program has also awarded 81 grants for about 2.4 million euros in total. While it is 
difficult to identify the potential outcome of projects at an early stage, the program has been 
rewarded by excellent outcomes. Most papers were published in the best international 
research journals. 
Yet not just academic successes were achieved. Some papers were also financed by the 
Foundation and later became hot policy topics, sometimes with very good insight. For 
instance, I think of a paper by Freixas, Parigi and Rochet on “Systemic Risk, Interbank 
Relationships and Liquidity Provision by the Central Bank” published in 2000 in the Journal of 
Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB). In 2000, that is eight years before the crisis. And yet the 
paper already underlined the importance of interbank relationships in the spread of risk. 
Some trends and evolutions in research in economics and in the work of central banks over 
the last twenty years were also identified and discussed. Obviously globalization and 
international links have played an ever more important role in monetary and financial 
economics (including with the creation of the euro for instance). There were also changes in 
economic research, as more attention was progressively given to actual policy-making. One 
of the leading examples is perhaps the so-called Taylor rule, which was created to describe 
the actual behavior of central bankers. This allowed a much richer interaction between 
academia and policy makers.  
Changes also affected policy-making, with more attention paid to academic debates. These 
even influenced the very structure of central banks. Research units were put into place and 
developed in most major central banks, including the Banque de France, which also 
implemented an External Evaluation of Research (EER). Central bankers indeed realized the 
importance of conducting their own research activities to support policy making. Heavier use 
of theoretical findings and data-based analysis was made, in order for central banks to better 
articulate their policy actions.  
Also, economic research outside central banks – which is not driven by direct “daily” topics – 
proved ultimately valuable for policy too. For example, some ideas developed in Krugman 
(1998) and Eggertson & Woodford (2003) on policy at the Zero Lower Bound, inspired by the 
economic stagnation in Japan, entered the United States and Euro Area policy debates 
years after their publication. 
The Banque de France Foundation has accompanied all these significant trends. By 
fostering research conducted by international teams. By sponsoring research unrelated to 
 
4 
 
immediate Banque de France needs, but which would ultimately prove beneficial for our 
policies. In that respect, I do expect that the Foundation will still play an important role in the 
next decade in promoting excellence in research in the field of monetary and financial 
economics. I also hope – and this will be my conclusion – that this is no wishful thinking 
either.  
Once again, let me thank all the participants, speakers, discussants and chairs that have 
joined us today for such fruitful talks and congratulate the young researchers who received a 
well-deserved prize for their work. A special thanks also to all the actors of the Foundation, 
whose constant help and dedication to their missions are precious and appreciated. Now is 
time to have lunch and I believe a buffet has been prepared. Thank you.

Lancement de « Citéco » 
 
22 septembre 2015 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
« De l’éducation dépend le destin d’un pays » affirmait Disraeli. Or, la France est 
perçue comme en retard en matière d’éducation économique. On l’a mesuré à diverses 
reprises, que ce soit dans les tests PISA menés par l’OCDE et l’Éducation nationale, pour 
les élèves de 15 ans, ou à travers les sondages successifs TNS SOFRES / Banque de 
France, pour ce qui est des adultes. 
Ces sondages montrent que le besoin et la demande d’un meilleur accès à la culture 
économique sont forts de la part du citoyen : celui-ci est un acteur économique au 
quotidien et il veut déchiffrer les débats d’experts dans les médias, décrypter les propositions 
de politique économique de tel ou tel parti politique et, finalement, disposer des moyens de 
faire des choix éclairés, pour lui-même ou son pays. 
La Banque de France en a pleinement conscience ; en outre, la compréhension des 
mécanismes économiques, financiers et monétaires est l’une des clefs de l’efficacité des 
politiques qu’elle mobilise.  
Par exemple, pour parler en économiste, les canaux de transmission de la politique 
monétaire à la sphère réelle n’atteignent une efficacité maximale que s’ils sont compris par 
tout un chacun. Prenons le cas du canal du taux d’intérêt. Courroie de transmission de la 
politique monétaire, il sera d’autant plus efficace que les emprunteurs comprendront bien les 
implications d’une variation des taux directeurs sur leurs futures mensualités d’emprunts – 
nouveaux ou renégociés – ou sur l’évolution du prix des actifs, immobiliers ou financiers. Il 
en va de même des canaux du crédit et du taux de change ou des mesures dites non 
conventionnelles auxquelles les banques centrales ont recours lorsque  la limite du taux  
zéro est atteinte par les  taux d’intérêt. C’est parce qu’ils seront mieux compris que de tels 
mécanismes agiront efficacement sur la demande.  
 
2 
 
De ce point de vue, participer à l’éducation économique et financière du public est une 
mission naturelle pour une banque centrale, actrice de la politique économique en 
général et garante de la stabilité monétaire et financière en particulier. C’est d’ailleurs une 
mission assumée par de nombreuses autres banques centrales. 
Vous savez certes que la Banque de France est déjà présente dans ce domaine. La Banque 
conçoit et diffuse des supports pédagogiques variés (brochures, notes d’information, vidéos). 
Elle répond aux questions du public sur sa plateforme téléphonique et sur internet. Elle 
accueille des groupes scolaires, organise des visites éducatives, des formations et des 
conférences. Son engagement est ancien auprès des académies de Paris et de Créteil et il 
s’élargit de plus en plus à d’autres académies en régions.  
À côté de ses activités traditionnelles de banque centrale, elle remplit aussi des missions 
complémentaires à l’éducation. Par exemple, elle instruit les dossiers de surendettement, 
s’assure du respect du droit au compte et tient les grands fichiers du consommateur de 
services financiers. Enfin, l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) exerce 
quant à elle un rôle spécifique dans la protection de la clientèle des banques et des 
assurances.  
La réponse de la Banque de France à ce besoin et cette demande de culture 
économique est  déjà forte. Mais elle a pris une nouvelle ampleur avec la  Cité de 
l’économie et de la monnaie.  
En attendant l’ouverture d’un lieu d’implantation physique, l’hôtel Gaillard, qui ouvrira ses 
portes à Paris en 2018, la Cité est déjà présente à travers toute la France notamment via 
son site internet, ses réseaux sociaux, son exposition itinérante et ses conférences. Avant de 
résumer le contenu de son programme 2015-2016, j’ai le plaisir de vous annoncer 
aujourd’hui la naissance de son identité visuelle et de son logo par un clip qui, je l’espère,  
vous plaira et vous donnera l’envie d’en savoir plus.  [Clip d’une minute].  
Pourquoi ce nom CITECO ? CITECO c’est d’abord un nom court, lisible, mémorisable, 
mettant en valeur le caractère citoyen et éducatif du projet. Le logo, avec son « é-globe », 
réunit la Cité à l’Économie.  
À la fois lettre et symbole pictographique, le « é-globe » illustre par son aspect de 
mappemonde les échanges économiques réalisés à l’échelle de la planète, tout en évoquant 
un visage de profil, soulignant le caractère humain de l’économie. Les visuels de la première 
campagne d’information de Citéco, que vous verrez dans le hall ou dans votre dossier, 
soulignent de leur côté qu’avec des moyens pédagogiques appropriés, notamment ceux mis 
à disposition par Citéco, tout le monde peut s’intéresser à l’économie et y prendre goût.

En résumé, cette nouvelle identité véhicule les valeurs de Citéco : modernité, proximité, 
accessibilité, simplicité, pédagogie, citoyenneté. 
 
Citéco, c’est surtout une Cité d’ores et déjà en action, dont je voudrais maintenant 
rappeler le contenu et les principaux vecteurs, visant à offrir aux enseignants, pour illustrer 
leurs cours, aux jeunes et au grand public un ensemble de ressources pédagogiques 
toujours plus important.  
1/ Un nouveau site web www.citeco.fr vient de se substituer à l’ancien, dès 
aujourd’hui. 
Au-delà de son adaptation graphique, qui renforce encore la clarté, reconnue, de l’ancien 
site, sa principale nouveauté est d’être maintenant accessible de manière plus adaptée pour 
tous ceux, en particulier les jeunes, qui utilisent des supports nomades (tablette, mobile). La 
page d’accueil du site se met aussi davantage à l’heure des réseaux sociaux, avec une 
application intégrée permettant de voir les plus récents tweets de Citéco et de s’abonner à 
son fil Twitter. 
Citeco.fr est un site qui offre une grande variété de contenus et rassemble dès cette année 
plus de 200 000 visiteurs. Y sont notamment proposés : 
- 1 200 articles,  
- une trentaine de vidéos, autant de présentations statistiques dynamiques et de 
bibliographies,  
- des jeux sur le développement durable et d’autres sur l’économie et la gestion,  
- des dossiers et débats, ainsi que des dossiers enseignants, chacun pour une 
vingtaine, 
- mais aussi une filmographie et une chronologie historique interactive –« 10 000 ans 
d’économie » - de 200 dates commentées, qui a été primée par un jury international. 
Parmi les nouveaux contenus pour 2015/2016, citons une filmographie sur la finance après 
celle sur l’entreprise, un jeu de marché avec offreurs et demandeurs qui a connu un grand 
succès en atelier avec des jeunes, des vidéos animées sur la création monétaire, les 
politiques monétaires conventionnelles et non-conventionnelles, un quiz sur les innovations 
développé avec l’Institut national audiovisuel (INA), des interviews d’experts pour un débat, 
ou encore une fresque interactive sur l’histoire de la pensée économique. 
2/ « Citéco », c’est aussi une exposition itinérante. L’exposition « L’économie : krach, 
boom, mue ? », présentée avec Universcience à Paris en 2013-14, a attiré plus de 150 000  
visiteurs. C’eut été dommage de ne pas la présenter ailleurs. Après Marseille en 2015, elle 
sera à Bordeaux, à Cap Sciences, au printemps 2016. Des conférences pédagogiques 
 
4 
 
accompagnent cette Cité en action lors des expositions itinérantes et lors d’événements 
locaux ou nationaux (Rencontres des Sciences Économiques et sociales – SES – à Paris, 
Rendez-vous de l’Histoire de Blois, Journées de l’économie – Jéco – de Lyon). Vous 
trouverez le détail de la programmation 2015 – 2016 des activités de Citéco dans la brochure 
qui vous a été remise. 
3/ Citéco, c’est enfin un réseau de partenaires pour toucher des publics, co-produire 
des contenus, co-organiser des événements. 
Ces partenaires sont mobilisés et fidèles. Parmi eux, l’Éducation nationale a une place à 
part. Nos premières opérations ont été organisées grâce aux inspections générales, à la 
Direction générale de l’enseignement scolaire, aux rectorats, aux enseignants de Paris, 
Lyon, Marseille et Bordeaux, à Canopé. Dans le cadre de ce partenariat, les enseignants 
nous aident notamment dans l’élaboration de nouveaux outils pédagogiques et lors des tests 
avec leurs classes.  
Je voudrais mentionner, bien sûr, Universcience (pour la coproduction de l’exposition 
« Économie : krach, boom, mue ? ») et la Bibliothèque Nationale de France (pour ses prêts 
de pièces d’or exceptionnelles). Ils sont représentés ici par les Présidents Bruno Maquart et 
Bruno Racine. Je tiens aussi à souligner notre sympathie vis-à-vis des équipes de la Cité 
des sciences confrontées aux conséquences du récent incendie.   
Les autres partenaires majeurs contribuant aux contenus actuels et futurs de de Citéco sont 
la Monnaie de Paris, le Musée des Arts et Métiers, l’INA, l’INSEE, l’OCDE, Bercy, l’IEFP, 
également représentés ici. A Paris, et au-delà de Paris, je tiens à citer la Mairie du 17
ème
 
arrondissement, la Région Ile de France et, lors d’événements clés pour Citéco, les 
Journées de l’économie  de Lyon, la Mairie de Marseille, Cap Sciences à Bordeaux et les 
Rendez-vous de l’Histoire à Blois ; enfin à l’étranger, le réseau des musées de banques 
centrales de l’Union européenne et le Museo interactivo de economia de la Banque centrale 
du Mexique.  
En fait, c’est toute une communauté de scientifiques, de muséographes, de pédagogues, de 
professionnels des médias, qui contribuent à Citéco, qu’il s’agisse de spécialistes de 
l’économie ou d’autres sciences sociales. Certains ont accepté de s’investir dans notre 
gouvernance, participant au Conseil scientifique. Je les remercie et j’apprécie la variété des 
horizons dont ils sont issus.  
Toutes ces actions préfigurent donc l’ouverture au public de l’hôtel Gaillard, dans le 17
ème
 
arrondissement de Paris, prévue en 2018 pour accueillir les éléments muséographiques de 
Citéco.  
 
5 
 
Merci à tous d’avoir marqué, aujourd’hui, cette étape importante de Citéco et 
l’avènement d’un acteur majeur de la pédagogie économique pour un public que nous 
attendons toujours plus nombreux.  
Nous espérons ainsi parvenir à faire mentir Oscar Wilde, selon qui « l’éducation est 
une chose admirable, mais rien de ce qui est digne d’être connu ne peut 
s’enseigner ». Eh bien, pour nous, non seulement l’économie est digne d’être connue, 
mais elle peut – et doit – s’enseigner, dans les salles de classe et ensuite tout au long 
de la vie. C’est précisément le credo de Citéco. Je vous remercie de votre présence et 
de votre attention.

Financial Regulation - Stability versus Uniformity 
A focus on non-bank actors 
 
Conférence ACPR - Banque de France 
 Lundi 28 septembre 2015	  
 
Discours de Christian Noyer 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution	  
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
It is a great pleasure for me to introduce this Conference on a particularly topical issue: 
“Financial regulation-stability versus uniformity, a focus on non-banks actors”. The title of the 
conference invites all the participants to reflect on the puzzle policy makers are facing these 
days:  
 
- on the one hand preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring a consistent approach 
to financial regulation between sectors  
- and on the other hand taking into account the idiosyncratic business models and risks 
of each actor or sector of the financial system.  
 
To explore further this question, I would like first to thank Professor Jean Tirole, the 2014 
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences  who will deliver the keynote address today. I 
am also honored to welcome the distinguished speakers, academics, policy makers, industry 
representatives who agreed to share with us their views on how best to regulate non-banks 
actors. 
 
Other the past few years, the Banque de France has developed a close cooperation with 
Jean and his colleagues from the Toulouse School of economics This partnership is taking 
various forms, among which, for instance, the organization of several joint conferences on 
liquidity or on the future of regulation or on public debt and which materialized as special 
issues of our Financial Stability Review. Jean has also developed his thinking about 
macroprudential policy and strategic interactions. This is at the heart of today’s conference. 
 
Non-banks actors are frequently referred to in the media as “shadow banks”. However, this 
does not mean that they are unregulated. Insurance companies, sometimes included in the 
definition of “shadow banking”, are tightly regulated in France and supervised by the ACPR 
while the AMF supervises asset managers.  
 
Regulating the shadow banking system has been and still is , as you know, a major objective 
for the G20 and the FSB since the 2008 financial crisis. The underlying objective was to 
prevent regulatory arbitrage and risk transfers outside the banking sector at a time where 
banking supervision has been considerably strengthened.  
 
Even though this objective is a very legitimate one as far financial stability is 
concerned, I would like to emphasize two ideas: 
 
(1) The first idea is that a number of pitfalls have emerged along the way. Indeed, 
consistency should not be mistaken with uniformity of the rules  
 
(2) And the second idea is that a “one size fits all” approach of shadow banking 
regulation could lead to unintended adverse consequences. 
 
1. Let me develop the first point: The 2008 crisis illustrated that the so called 
« shadow banking sector » played an important role in propagating and 
amplifying financial instability throughout the financial system. Shedding some 
light on these entities and regulating them to prevent contagion and regulatory 
arbitrage has been therefore a key milestone of the G20 Financial regulation 
agenda ever since. The Banque de France has been involved in this policy work 
from the outset. 
 
A first part of the work consisted in defining what the “shadow banking sector” is about. It 
does embody a wide variety of institutions worldwide which accomplish credit intermediation 
along with maturity transformation outside of the “traditional” banking sector. As an output, it 
transforms illiquid assets into liquid ones.  
The approach of shadow banking has progressively expanded to a variety of actors and 
activities: Money Markets Funds; Securitization, Repos and Securities Financing 
Transactions. The work dedicated to preventing the financial risks arising from the shadow 
banking system became intertwined with the work aiming at ending “too big to fail”. In the 
wake of the Globally Systemically Important Banks, the Financial Stability Board started 
working on identifying and defining a regulatory regime applicable to Globally Systemically 
Important Insurers (GSIIs), Non-Bank-Non Insurance SIFIs (NBNIs), Critical Market 
Infrastructures/CCPs.  
The focus of the work also shifted from monitoring/statistical reporting to rule making. 
Beyond the yearly shadow banking monitoring exercises, policy makers intended to make 
sure that no part of the financial system would be left unregulated and that a similar set of 
rules should apply to a similar set of risks. For the sake of a better regulation of globally 
systemically important institutions, some progress remains possible in the monitoring, and 
the need for relevant data in particular as regards the better understanding of inter-linkages 
among G-SII. Cross-sectorial consistency was seen as a key factor to prevent any 
opportunity for regulatory arbitrage and preserve appropriate level playing field.  
The Financial Stability Board following the G20 recommendation has launched an ambitious 
regulatory program which aims at better controlling risks which are related the shadow 
banking sector. Indeed, the US have recently adopted a regulatory framework for Money 
Market Funds (July 2014). Other reviews are still ongoing, I am thinking of the assessment of 
risks and systemicity of asset managers whose assets under management have experienced 
a major growth these last few years, or the rapid development of ETFs providing real time 
liquidity on their liability while their matching assets have a lower liquidity. 
In Europe, this global initiative translated into a number of regulatory initiatives such as the 
Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (repos and SFTRs) or the Regulation of Money 
Market Funds. The final objective was to turn the shadow banking sector into a safer and 
regulated “market-based financing”.  
 
2. Coming now to my second point: even though regulatory arbitrage is a risk, 
consistency between sectors should not be mistaken with uniformity and a 
“one size fits all” approach could lead to unintended adverse consequences.  
 
From a financial stability perspective, one can easily draw the conclusion that risks of bank’s 
runs and shadow banking entity’s runs are very similar and therefore should have a similar 
regulatory treatment. Yet, the timing and consequences of higher lapses in insurance are 
hardly comparable to the banks’ one. Moreover, the shadow banking sector is much more 
complex, not harmonized and hard to fully capture, even after the massive reduction of 
activities related to this sector which followed the financial crisis. Indeed, entities such as 
insurance companies, CCPs, asset managers and any other non-bank actors have their own 
business models and specificities.  
Therefore mirroring by duplicating the GSIBs approach to these non-bank actors may either 
lead to inadequate policy options (TLAC for CCPs, ill calibrated Higher Loss Absorbency 
(HLA) for GSIIS) or to fostering pro-cyclicality. In this latter case, all market players would 
take the same positions, on the same financial instruments at the same time fostering a “one 
way” market. This herd behavior can lead to detrimental consequences in terms of financial 
stability by amplifying an irrational market decision based upon no fundamentals, which could 
rapidly spread to the whole financial sphere. 
In addition, none of these sectors is unregulated today in Europe (AIFM directive for 
alternative funds, UCITS directives for funds, Solvency 2 for insurance, EMIR for CCPs) and 
replicating some rules stemming from banking supervision to these entities would simply be 
irrelevant. 
More generally, it is up to the policy makers to act consistently and try to anticipate and 
mitigate any possible unintended effects of their policy decisions. For instance it might seem 
contradictory to encourage central clearing of derivatives or trading on organized trading 
platform as a means to reduce systemic risks on the one hand, while on the other hand 
levying a Financial Transaction Tax on these operations if they are deemed safer.  
 
Policy makers should make sure their actions will not be a factor of market instability which 
could spread to the market and create another crisis. 
 
Conclusion 
As we can see, policy makers have still a lot of work on their plate as regards the design of 
an adequate regulatory framework for the “shadow banking sector” and for it to be sufficiently 
sound to be providing a sustainable  “market based financing”. The Capital Market Union’s 
project launched by the European Commission is aiming at achieving to achieve a sound 
regulatory framework. To this end, for instance, the European Commission with the help of 
the European Banking Association (EBA) has recently defined criteria for Simple, 
Transparent and Standardized (STS) securitization. The idea is both to regain investors’ 
confidence in securitization assets, which we must admit still suffers from the US subprime 
crisis, and to encourage banks to deleverage loans portfolio from their balance sheet to 
refinance the real economy. By encouraging this new type of securitization, the European 
Commission is mindful to avoid another subprime crisis.  
Indeed, rebalancing the financing mix of the EU economy as promoted in the CMU initiative 
is a valuable objective provided a rightly calibrated regulatory and risk framework is in place. 
These are some of the challenges to tackle in the years to come. And let me wish you a 
fruitful conference. I now leave the floor to Jean Tirole.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
« Changement climatique : le secteur financier et le chemin vers les 2 degrés » 
30 novembre 2015 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Cette conférence organisée grâce à la 2° Investing Initiative, la Oxford Martin School 
et France Stratégie, pour l’ouverture de la COP 21, est un événement majeur, et je 
suis heureux d’y participer. Je voudrais aujourd’hui avancer quelques remarques sur 
un sujet qui a pris de l’importance dans l’agenda du changement climatique, à savoir 
la façon dont les banques centrales et les superviseurs financiers peuvent prendre en 
compte les défis liés à ce changement.  
C’est une question assez nouvelle, de fait. Chacun de nous était déjà engagé, comme 
citoyen et comme responsable public. Mais les autorités monétaires et prudentielles 
sont aujourd’hui concernées par trois grandes catégories de risques : 
- Les risques physiques directs, liés à l’augmentation de la fréquence et de 
l’ampleur des événements climatiques extrêmes, qui posent des questions de 
coûts d’assurance. 
- Les risques induits de responsabilité, liés aux impacts financiers des 
demandes de compensation de la part de ceux qui subissent des dommages 
dus au changement climatique. 
- Les risques macroéconomiques liés à la transition entre deux modèles 
productifs, qui peut entraîner des ajustements chaotiques dans les secteurs 
trop exposés au réchauffement ou non-rentables dans le contexte de sa 
limitation. 
 
2 
 
En pratique, on peut déjà observer des déséquilibres financiers au sein des secteurs 
fortement émetteurs de carbone, qui font face à des coûts en hausse, à l’apparition de 
technologies perturbatrices, et à des incertitudes réglementaires1. La valeur de 
marché de la plupart des secteurs fortement émetteurs est déjà touchée. Et une 
modification des prix pourrait survenir rapidement et de façon abrupte. 
Ce qui est moins clair actuellement, c’est la façon dont nous devons agir face à ce 
contexte, parce que l’horizon de réalisation des risques liés au changement climatique 
dépasse le temps traditionnel des agents économiques, et notamment des acteurs 
financiers. C’est la désormais fameuse « tragédie de l’horizon » décrite par mon 
collègue Mark Carney2.  
Nous sommes tous d’accord sur l’idée qu’un prix du carbone plus élevé serait le bon 
signal économique. Mais nous connaissons la difficulté de la prise de décisions 
internationales en la matière. En attendant de telles décisions, la question est d’ores 
et déjà la suivante, vue de la responsabilité qui est la mienne : comment éviter un 
défaut de conscience des investisseurs et des intermédiaires financiers sur leur 
exposition aux risques ? Et comment éviter une mauvaise allocation du capital, qui 
serait trop favorable aux secteurs intensifs en carbone ou aux actifs inexploitables ? 
Face à ces interrogations, il faut d’abord souligner que le secteur financier et la 
société civile sont heureusement déjà en mouvement (I). Ensuite, j’aborderai la 
nécessité d’une intervention publique pour garantir l’alignement des intérêts (II).    
I/ Le secteur financier et la société civile se sont déjà mis en mouvement. 
Cette mobilisation a été source de progrès ; et pour la résumer, elle me semble s’être 
faite en trois temps. 
D’abord, les grandes institutions financières publiques ont été à l’avant-garde de 
ce mouvement. C’est le cas de la Banque européenne de reconstruction et de 
développement (BERD) ou de la Caisse des Dépôts, avec CDC-Climat. La Banque 
européenne d’investissement (BEI) estime octroyer aujourd’hui 25% de ses prêts – 
près de 20 milliards d’euros par an – à des projets « verts ». 
Puis, sous l’égide des Nations Unies, sont nés des projets comme l’UNEP finance 
initiative, partenariat entre le Programme des Nations Unies pour l’environnement 
                                                          
1 Cf. Moody’s Investors Service, « Impact of Carbon Reduction Policies is Rising Globally », mars 2015. 
2 M. Carney, « Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon – Climate change and financial stability », discours prononcé le 29/09/2015. 
3 
 
(PNUE) et 200 institutions du secteur financier, qui font de la soutenabilité 
environnementale un impératif collectif, échangent les meilleures pratiques et se fixent 
des principes en matière de financements verts. Avec l’engagement de Montréal sur 
le changement climatique, ou la Coalition pour la décarbonisation des portefeuilles, 
les investisseurs signataires s’astreignent à mesurer et à publier l’empreinte carbone 
de leurs portefeuilles. L’objectif est ambitieux : réduire les investissements dans les 
projets fortement émetteurs de carbone de plusieurs centaines de milliards de dollars. 
Enfin, les institutions financières s’engagent aujourd’hui plus directement. Des 
banques et des assureurs français ont annoncé récemment le retrait de leur soutien 
au charbon et l’augmentation de leur financement des énergies renouvelables. Paris 
Europlace a appelé à la création d’un fonds d’investissement dans la transition 
énergétique, qui serait alimenté par les contributions des entreprises bancaires, 
d’assurance et de gestion d’actifs françaises, et qui pourrait investir 10 milliards 
d’euros à l’horizon 2020, pour financer des projets d’amélioration de l’efficacité 
énergétique ou de promotion des énergies renouvelables. Cette initiative mérite d’être 
saluée. 
II/ Pour aligner au mieux ces initiatives privées dans le sens du « bien public » 
qu’est la lutte contre le réchauffement, une intervention publique est cependant 
nécessaire.  
Trois questions se posent aujourd’hui pour un banquier central ou une autorité 
prudentielle : celle du financement –et de l’interaction avec la politique monétaire–, 
celle de l’information –et de la publication ou disclosure–, et enfin celle de l’horizon 
temporel –et par là des stress tests–. 
 
1- La question du financement : quelle interaction avec la politique 
monétaire ? 
 
Le changement climatique est susceptible d’affecter les prix des biens et services. Il a 
un impact direct sur celui des denrées alimentaires. Mais il affectera plus largement la 
croissance, de même que l’allocation des ressources. Dans ce contexte, il est certain 
que les banquiers centraux devront garder un œil sur –et même veiller sur– les 
conséquences économiques du changement climatique. Et la politique monétaire 
devra jouer son rôle d’accompagnement du rééquilibrage progressif des structures de 
prix, en ligne avec son mandat de maintien de la stabilité des prix.  
4 
 
En vertu du statut du Système européen de banques centrales (SEBC), à l’article 2, 
« sans préjudice de l’objectif de stabilité des prix, le SEBC apporte son soutien aux 
politiques économiques, en vue de contribuer à la réalisation des objectifs [de l’Union, 
notamment une croissance soutenable et non-inflationniste, respectueuse de 
l’environnement, et l’élévation de la qualité de vie].  
Certains envisagent d’aller plus loin en utilisant l’outil de l’assouplissement quantitatif 
pour contribuer à financer la transition énergétique. Acheter des actifs verts, accorder 
un traitement favorable aux actifs verts éligibles au collatéral, ou bien mettre en place 
des facilités dédiées à long terme… Longue est la liste des possibilités éventuelles. 
Mais ne nous trompons pas sur la nature de la politique monétaire. Elle doit permettre 
d’atteindre des objectifs macroéconomiques, plutôt que des objectifs spécifiques liés à 
tel ou tel secteur. L’hypothèse sous-jacente aux interventions directes de politique 
monétaire est qu’une banque centrale serait mieux équipée que des agents privés 
pour garantir une allocation efficace des ressources. Mais cet avantage des banques 
centrales en matière d’information est loin d’être certain. L’assouplissement quantitatif 
ne vise donc pas à promouvoir certains types d’actifs plutôt que d’autres, mais 
simplement à libérer les capacités de financement de l’économie. Ainsi, l’actuelle 
politique monétaire favorise le report des investisseurs vers des projets plus longs, et 
à meilleur rendement que les obligations souveraines, comme les infrastructures et la 
transition énergétique. À une condition essentielle : il faut que la réglementation 
prudentielle soit cohérente en ce sens, ce qui peut nécessiter des adaptations du 
cadre fixé par la directive Solvabilité II pour les assurances. Je salue certaines 
propositions récentes de la Commission européenne en faveur des infrastructures, qui 
vont dans la bonne direction. 
 
2- Le défi de l’information : quel rôle pour la publication (le disclosure) ? 
 
Les risques potentiels que pose le changement climatique au secteur financier sont 
complexes, et leur compréhension n’en est qu’à ses débuts. Le besoin le plus urgent 
est probablement celui d’une meilleure information. 
Beaucoup de travail – et un travail de qualité – a été fait ces dernières années, en 
faveur de la publication d’informations. La loi française sur la transition énergétique, 
promulguée en août, renforce les exigences en matière de publication des risques 
environnementaux. Son article 173 exige des investisseurs institutionnels qu’ils 
5 
 
incluent, dans leurs rapports annuels, des objectifs environnementaux, notamment 
l’exposition aux risques climatiques, en mesurant l’empreinte carbone des actifs qu’ils 
financent et la part « verte » de ces actifs, comparée à des cibles. Le décret 
d’application de la loi, en cours d’élaboration, précisera les informations concernées et 
leur présentation.  
Il devra prendre plus largement la mesure du défi de la clarification : il y a environ 
400 dispositifs de publication d’informations liées au climat. Imposer des exigences ou 
formuler des recommandations en termes de publication d'informations peut être un 
instrument puissant de discipline de marché, dès lors que les informations concernées 
sont ciblées et pertinentes, comme en témoignent quelques exemples réussis. Au 
plan international, sous l'égide du Conseil de stabilité financière, une première task 
force dite ""Enhanced Disclosure Task Force"" et composée de représentants du 
secteur avait déjà émis en 2012 des recommandations pour améliorer, simplifier et 
cibler la communication des banques d'importance systémique sur la nature de leurs 
risques. Au plan national, le guide sur la pertinence, la cohérence et la lisibilité des 
états financiers publié par l’Autorité des marchés financiers en juillet dernier est un 
autre exemple positif. 
La clarification est un défi à prendre au sérieux. Nous avons donc décidé, au sein du 
Conseil de stabilité financière avec le soutien du récent G20 à Antalya, la mise en 
place très prochaine – d’ici le début de l’année 2016 – d’une autre task force (EDTF) 
dédiée. Ses travaux devront aboutir en un an afin de permettre rapidement une 
publication effective des risques liés au changement climatique. Elle développera des 
recommandations de publication volontaire, selon des modalités harmonisées et 
donc comparables. Cela permettra aux parties intéressées et au public de mieux 
connaître la part d’actifs liés aux émissions de carbone que comprend le secteur 
financier et son degré d’exposition aux risques climatiques. 
 
3- Le défi de l’horizon temporel : quels stress-tests mettre en œuvre 
progressivement ? 
 
Conduire des stress tests fait partie intégrante de la gestion des risques par les 
institutions financières. C’est dans les secteurs de l’assurance et de la réassurance 
que cette gestion par des stress tests est actuellement la plus développée. La 
modélisation des risques de catastrophes et des niveaux de fonds propres – prévue 
6 
 
dans Solvabilité II – y prend en compte une partie des risques climatiques. Mais le 
cadre réglementaire actuel pour les banques néglige en quelque sorte le changement 
climatique en tant que source de risques. Ce serait pourtant la façon de traiter la 
question de l’horizon temporel. À cet égard, la loi sur la transition énergétique prévoit 
la remise d’ici fin 2016 d’un rapport sur la mise en œuvre d’un scénario de stress tests 
représentatifs des risques associés au changement climatique pour les banques.  
Pour autant, la réalisation de cette avancée pose des questions sérieuses. Deux 
approches sont envisageables. Celle d’un stress global, couvrant l’intégralité des 
risques et les classes d’actifs associées pour les établissements financiers, ce qui 
permettrait au superviseur de surveiller l’exposition totale aux risques climatiques. Ou 
bien celle d’un stress granulaire concentré sur les actifs plus spécifiquement 
exposés au risque climatique, ce qui serait plus approprié pour analyser des secteurs 
et besoins de financement spécifiques, comme par exemple le financement du 
secteur pétrolier. 
Quelle que soit l’approche retenue, le défi principal serait d’inclure les risques liés au 
changement climatique, soit par des estimations économiques que nous maîtrisons 
comme le PIB observé en situation de stress, soit directement à travers des variables 
climatiques – comme l’élévation de la température – qui nécessiteraient de nouvelles 
méthodes et la collecte d’informations. Cela impliquerait évidemment de se fier au 
jugement des experts sur ces questions, dans un contexte où les institutions 
financières n’ont pas suffisamment de recul pour appréhender les risques futurs. Nous 
y travaillerons avec l’ACPR et les autorités publiques concernées. 
*   *   * 
La compréhension et l’analyse des risques liés aux changements climatiques sont 
essentielles. Les projets de  réglementation en cours – loi sur la transition énergétique 
ou travaux du Conseil de stabilité financière – sur la publication d’informations 
constituent des outils utiles pour que la transition vers une économie plus verte soit 
active et donc maîtrisée. Ces initiatives pourront aussi favoriser une prise de 
conscience des acteurs de marché quant au taux d’actualisation qu’ils utilisent, qui 
soit davantage compatible avec le passage à une économie plus verte. Le rapport 
Canfin-Grandjean de juin 2015 comporte aussi nombre de pistes stimulantes.  
Mais nous devons en même temps rester modestes. Nous, acteurs publics, ne savons 
pas tout. Et nous ne pouvons pas nous substituer aux acteurs privés, financiers ou 
7 
 
non. Il nous faudra nous assurer que toute nouvelle exigence offre les bonnes 
incitations aux institutions financières, permet un certain degré de flexibilité pour les 
autorités, et ne crée pas de désincitation à la poursuite du processus de transition 
énergétique. 
  
8 
 
Modestes, adaptables, mais déterminés. Parce qu’il y a une bataille à gagner et parce 
que les signaux qui sont aujourd’hui ceux du marché – ses prix du carbone trop bas, 
son horizon de temps trop court – sont insuffisants pour garantir pleinement la 
mobilisation. Il y a de nombreuses initiatives privées. Mais il y a aussi besoin d’un 
cadre public qui sécurise l’alignement général et durable des intérêts. Nous sommes 
déterminés à y prendre toute notre part, de Bâle à Paris et ailleurs. Je vous remercie.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
« La compétitivité française : nouveaux enjeux, nouvelles mesures » 
 
Mercredi 16 décembre 2015 
 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir à cette conférence co-organisée par la Banque de France 
et France Stratégie, et je vous remercie de votre présence.  La question de la compétitivité est l’un 
des grands enjeux actuels de la zone euro. 
 
Mais bien sûr, cette question n’est pas sans lien avec ce qui constitue le cœur de métier d’un 
banquier central : la définition et la conduite de la politique monétaire. Politique monétaire et 
politique de compétitivité se complètent mais ne sauraient se substituer l’une à l’autre. 
 
La politique monétaire peut beaucoup, et nous avons fait beaucoup. Quelques mots sur 
l’actualité récente. Le 3 décembre dernier, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a encore 
accentué cette politique, en abaissant le taux d’intérêt de la facilité de dépôt à -0,30%, et en 
annonçant un renforcement de son programme étendu d’achats de titres (APP), sous la forme 
d’une extension de sa durée de six mois – soit 360 milliards d’euros d’achats supplémentaires – et 
du réinvestissement des remboursements au titre du principal sur les titres APP à leur échéance – 
soit 320 milliards d’euros supplémentaires jusqu’en 2019. L’importance même de ces montants 
additionnels montre combien la réaction immédiate des marchés a été excessive. La Federal 
Reserve américaine, symétriquement, prendra les décisions adaptées au vu de la situation 
économique américaine : son mandat comme le nôtre est d’abord domestique. Il ne s’agit donc 
pas de « grande divergence », et le taux de change n’est pas un objectif de la politique monétaire ; 
2 
mais il est certain que la parité euro-dollar actuelle a des effets favorables sur notre compétitivité-
prix. 
 
L’efficacité de la politique monétaire se juge dans la durée, et pas dans la volatilité de l’instant 
ou la nervosité de ces jours-ci. Nous avons maintenant, avec le recul depuis juin 2014 et l’annonce 
de ces politiques non-conventionnelles, des mesures fiables et convergentes de leur efficacité. En 
dix-huit mois, le taux des crédits bancaires aux entreprises a baissé d’environ 80 pb en zone euro, 
et leur encours est passé d’un recul de -3,1% à une croissance à +0,6%. Un tel retournement de 
tendance est rare. La politique non conventionnelle augmente la perspective de croissance de la 
zone euro de 1% sur 2015-2017, et celle d’inflation de 0,5% en 2016 et 0,3% en 2017.  
 
La politique monétaire fait beaucoup. Pour autant, gardons-nous de tout attendre de la 
politique monétaire. La mise en place d’une monnaie unique en Europe a rendu toute 
dévaluation nominale impossible. Dès lors, la compétitivité est « the rule of the game ». C’est le 
cas aujourd’hui comme lors de l’introduction de l’euro. Nous, Français, ainsi que nos partenaires 
du Sud de l’Europe, l’avons oublié pendant dix ans. Les succès allemands, puis la crise de la zone 
euro à partir de 2010, nous l’ont rappelé très fortement.  
 
En 2015, la France figure parmi les trois États de la zone euro présentant des déséquilibres 
macroéconomiques excessifs au sens de la Commission européenne (avec l’Italie et le Portugal). 
Dans le cas français, ces déséquilibres concernent la détérioration de la balance commerciale et 
de la compétitivité, ainsi que le fort endettement du secteur public. Une telle situation française 
renforce encore l’intérêt de cette conférence sur la compétitivité, qui s’articule autour de trois 
impératifs : 
 
- D’abord, mesurer : nous parlerons des nouvelles mesures de la compétitivité ; 
 
- Ensuite, diagnostiquer le retard de compétitivité français ; 
 
- Et donc renforcer : la table ronde de cet après-midi évoquera les pistes susceptibles de  
renforcer la compétitivité française ; 
 
- Je terminerai par un quatrième impératif : élargir notre débat sur la compétitivité aux 
dimensions de l’Europe. 
 
I. Mieux mesurer la compétitivité. 
La première session de cette conférence sera consacrée aux nouvelles mesures de la 
compétitivité. « Une mesure exacte vaut l’avis d’un millier d’experts » disait l’informaticienne Grace 
3 
Hopper
1
. Le déploiement actuel de nouvelles méthodes et de nouveaux indicateurs témoigne de la 
richesse et de l’actualité de la recherche. Une présentation des bases de données disponibles en 
ligne sera de plus proposée pendant les pauses. 
Ces nouvelles mesures éclairent le constat du retard de compétitivité français. Par exemple, une 
étude de la Banque de France
2
, présentée ce matin, propose une nouvelle mesure de la 
compétitivité, nettoyée des effets de composition sectoriels et géographiques, pour expliquer les 
variations de parts de marché des exportateurs. Elle montre que, depuis 2006, la France perd 
3,2% de parts de marché en valeur, en moyenne chaque année. Ce chiffre était seulement de 
1,2% pour la zone euro sur la même période. Cette perte ne résulte pas d’une mauvaise 
spécialisation sectorielle ou géographique française. Les pays européens souffrent tous d’un effet 
de composition géographique négatif puisqu’ils échangent entre eux et que l’Europe croît moins 
vite que le reste du monde. En outre, contrairement à une idée répandue, la spécialisation par 
produits a peu d’impact sur les variations de parts de marché et elle ne constitue pas un 
désavantage pour la France. 
 
II. Diagnostiquer : Quels sont les déterminants de la perte de compétitivité 
française ? 
 
Les évolutions du taux de change de l’euro, communes à la France et à l’Allemagne et en 
dépréciation tendancielle depuis l’été 2008, ne permettent pas d’expliquer la dégradation de la 
compétitivité française par rapport à nos partenaires européens. Le premier élément de réponse 
se trouve bien sûr dans l’évolution des coûts unitaires du travail (CUT) dans les années 2000. 
Entre 1999 et 2007, ces coûts ont en effet progressé plus rapidement en France qu’en Allemagne, 
avec 17% de hausse relative cumulée. Cela a été pire encore pour l’Espagne et l’Italie, avec +30% 
de hausse relative par rapport à l’Allemagne.  
 
À cela s’ajoute le fait, souligné par le rapport Gallois
3
, que « confrontée à la concurrence, 
l’industrie française a été conduite à préserver sa compétitivité-prix au détriment de sa 
compétitivité hors-prix ». Les marges réduites dans le secteur industriel auraient donc limité les 
moyens disponibles pour l’amélioration de la compétitivité hors-prix. Ce cercle vicieux prix/hors 
prix explique-t-il le décrochage français par rapport au voisin allemand pour ce qui est des parts de 
marché ? Vous en discuterez dans la deuxième session.

Une autre interrogation, moins fréquemment évoquée, porte sur la démographie des entreprises 
exportatrices. La France compte une moyenne d’environ 100 000 firmes et PME exportatrices 
ces dernières années. C’est beaucoup moins qu’en Allemagne où on en compte plus de 300 000. 
Une étude de la Banque de France
4
 montre en outre que ces firmes sont hétérogènes. Moins de 
30% des entreprises entrant sur un marché étranger y survivent plus d’un an. Certaines participent 
au commerce international de manière occasionnelle. Enfin, la contribution des firmes à la 
croissance des exportations diffère selon leur âge et leur taille.   
 
III. Comment en conséquence renforcer la compétitivité française ? 
 
Les réformes introduites récemment par le Gouvernement ont cherché à soutenir la compétitivité-
coût et ont principalement ciblé le marché du travail, à travers le CICE et le Pacte de 
responsabilité et de solidarité. Elles permettent une baisse visible des prix relatifs – les coûts 
unitaires du travail devraient être stables sur 2014-2017, contre +1% par an en zone euro et +2% 
en Allemagne – et une amélioration effective du taux de marge des entreprises qui passerait de 
29,5% en 2014 à 32,3% en 2017. Ceci favorise l’offre des entreprises exportatrices. Elles sont, en 
outre, susceptibles d’avoir un impact à un horizon plus long au travers d’un renforcement de la 
R&D, soutenue notamment par le Crédit d’impôt recherche
5
.  
 
Toutefois, ces réformes ont un coût et ne sont que partielles. En témoigne l’exemple de la difficile 
réforme des règles de revalorisation du SMIC, qui sont pour partie à l’origine de l’augmentation 
relative des coûts salariaux unitaires en France et de la faiblesse de l’emploi. Mais il n’est pas de 
réforme plus importante pour notre compétitivité que celle de notre système d’éducation et de 
formation, à commencer par l’apprentissage. Selon une enquête conduite par l’Eurosystème6, sur 
la période 2010-2013, en pleine crise donc, plus de 70% des entreprises françaises disent ne 
pouvoir recruter par manque de travail qualifié : c’est le taux le plus élevé d’Europe, et cette 
exception française est la plus choquante de toutes alors que, parallèlement, le chômage frappe 
des millions d’adultes et de jeunes. 
 
Il faudrait en outre élargir le débat pour concevoir la compétitivité-prix dans un cadre plus large, 
plus structurel, et rechercher une meilleure efficacité des secteurs abrités de la concurrence 
internationale. La valeur ajoutée provenant des services domestiques représente une part 
importante des exportations manufacturières des pays riches, notamment en France, où elle 
dépasse les 30%

protectrices accroît le pouvoir de négociation des entreprises des secteurs réglementés non-
exposés à la concurrence internationale. Ces entreprises abritées peuvent alors accaparer une 
partie de la valeur ajoutée de leurs clients et dégrader leur compétitivité-prix. 
 
La loi dite « Macron » notamment, a allégé les régulations pour certaines professions. Beaucoup 
reste cependant à faire. Globalement, les réformes d’ouverture des marchés, des biens et services 
comme du travail, sont potentiellement très bénéfiques pour les échanges extérieurs comme pour 
les perspectives de croissance de l’économie. Une étude de la Banque de France, fondée sur les 
réformes des pays étrangers, montre que des gains pouvant aller jusqu’à 6% de productivité 
supplémentaire pourraient être obtenus à long terme pour notre pays
8
 par ces réformes 
d’ouverture. 
 
 
IV. Élargir enfin notre débat sur la compétitivité aux dimensions de l’Europe 
 
Le redressement de nos économies est d’autant plus délicat qu’il est mené dans une période de 
bas de cycle. C’est pourquoi il doit être coordonné au niveau européen. C’est ce que prévoit la 
procédure concernant les déséquilibres macroéconomiques (MIP : Macroeconomic Imbalances 
Procedure), mise en œuvre dans le cadre du semestre européen. Elle doit constituer un 
instrument beaucoup plus efficace pour surveiller et limiter les écarts de compétitivité entre pays 
membres.  
 
Dans son ensemble, la zone euro affiche un excédent courant de 2,5% de son PIB sur un an, 
en avril 2015
9
. Ce chiffre n’est bon qu’en apparence. Il est trop haut pour une économie en retard 
de croissance et d’investissement, et il recouvre des disparités importantes. En effet, cet excédent 
est largement influencé par les chiffres élevés en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas et par une 
dégradation de la demande lors de la crise, notamment dans les pays du Sud de l’Europe. Mais ce 
chiffre dit aussi, notamment pour l’Espagne, la réussite de réformes structurelles mises en œuvre 
durant la crise, avec un retour des excédents commerciaux en 2013, après plus de quarante ans 
de déficits. Au-delà des questions de compétitivité, ces disparités intra-zone euro témoignent d’un 
défaut de coordination des politiques de demande des différents pays. La mise en œuvre d’un 
salaire minimum légal en Allemagne et la prise en charge courageuse d’un grand nombre de 
réfugiés dans ce pays contribueront, en partie seulement, à atténuer les effets de ce défaut de 
coordination. 
 
                                                 
8 Une étude menée à la Banque de France indique que des réformes sur les marchés des biens et du travail pourraient amener environ 
6  % de gains de productivité à long terme en France, dont 2,5% pour les réformes du marché du travail et 1,5% pour celles du marché 
des biens (Cette G., J. Lopez et J. Mairesse, « Product and labor market regulations, production prices, wages and productivity », 
NBER working paper 20563, 2014).

Le 21 octobre dernier, la Commission européenne a adopté une recommandation – trop peu 
remarquée – dans laquelle elle appelle à la création de conseils nationaux de la compétitivité, 
constitués potentiellement en réseau européen. Ces conseils devraient être chargés de surveiller 
l'évolution des salaires, des prix, de l'emploi et de la croissance, ainsi que des comptes extérieurs, 
puis de fournir des recommandations aux autorités nationales et aux partenaires sociaux. Selon 
les termes du rapport des cinq présidents
10
, ces conseils, avec d’autres éléments, contribueront à 
l’émergence d’une Union économique de la convergence, de la croissance et de l'emploi. Je crois 
celle-ci très souhaitable. Mais soyons clairs : contrairement à ce qu’on veut parfois croire en 
France, la nécessaire coordination européenne ne remplace en rien les indispensables 
réformes domestiques. Les réformes domestiques sont la condition de notre compétitivité, et de 
notre crédibilité dans le débat européen qui est impérativement devant nous. 
 
Je laisse maintenant la parole aux participants de la première session et vous souhaite une très 
bonne conférence. Merci de votre attention.

François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Discours de bienvenue au Symposium 
 
 
TAUX D’INTÉRÊT ULTRA-BAS ET DÉFIS POUR LES BANQUES CENTRALES 
 
12 janvier 2016 
 
 
 
Bienvenue à Paris et à la Banque de France ... Je m’exprimerai maintenant en anglais pour vous 
accueillir tous dans ce nouveau centre de conférences créé par vous, mon cher Christian. Quel meilleur 
moyen de vous dire au revoir après douze années  passées comme gouverneur de la Banque de France 
(BDF) et six années à la présidence de la Banque des règlements internationaux (BRI) ? Et quel meilleur 
moyen pour moi d’accueillir, en tant que nouvel arrivé, cette communauté unique d’acteurs, 
d’universitaires et d’observateurs qui contribuent sincèrement ensemble à une meilleure compréhension 
de la politique monétaire et de la stabilité financière ? 
Pour citer quelques chiffres, quelque 200 personnalités importantes sont réunies ici, représentant plus 
de 80 banques centrales, gouvernements et organisations internationales, ainsi qu’une cinquantaine 
d’universités, de think tanks et d’institutions financières. Ce n'est pas une surprise, puisque Christian 
aimait tous vous rencontrer lors de rencontres internationales et de conférences de recherche.  
Le titre de ce symposium, choisi conjointement par la BDF et la BRI, a trait à la persistance de taux 
d'intérêt très bas au cours des sept dernières années dans les économies avancées et, par contagion, dans 
le reste du monde. Même aux États-Unis après la récente remontée des taux engagée par la FED, les 
taux d'intérêt demeurent encore historiquement faibles et le cycle de resserrement monétaire a été 
annoncé comme devant être « progressif ». 
Pourquoi les taux ultra-bas doivent-ils être une source de préoccupation pour les banquiers centraux ? 
Pour de nombreuses raisons, et notamment parce que ces taux ultra-bas peuvent engendrer une mauvaise 
allocation des ressources ou des bulles et parce qu'ils vont actuellement de pair avec une inflation 
2 
 
durablement trop basse : on parle de « basse-flation », devrait-on même dire « zéro-flation » ? Cette 
« basse-flation » est particulièrement préoccupante au regard des coûts associés aux rigidités  et 
distorsions des prix ou des salaires ainsi qu’au risque d’entrée en déflation. 
Mon rôle de « premier orateur » consiste modestement à mettre l’accent sur les quelques énigmes et défis 
auxquels nous sommes confrontés. Vous disposerez de la journée entière pour y apporter les meilleures 
réponses. Pour commencer, je m'attacherai à présenter la situation actuelle en proposant deux 
énigmes, et j'évoquerai ensuite ce que la politique monétaire doit ou peut faire, en évoquant quatre 
défis.  
 
I.  Quelle est la situation actuelle? Et tout d’abord, qu’entend-on par « ultra-bas »? 
Beaucoup de variables importantes pour les banques centrales se situent à des niveaux historiquement bas 
ou ultra-bas, notamment dans les économies avancées : premièrement, l'inflation, qu'elle soit globale ou 
sous-jacente, réalisée ou attendue; deuxièmement, les taux d'intérêt sur les actifs sûrs, qu'ils soient à court 
ou à long terme, nominaux ou réels, ex post ou ex ante; troisièmement, les primes de terme malgré les 
incertitudes liées aux mesures. La nouveauté est que simultanément toutes ces variables ont diminué et se 
situent désormais à un niveau bas.  
 
Les spreads et la volatilité ont également été plus faibles sur de plus longues périodes, malgré une 
certaine discrimination pratiquée par les marchés entre les agents et entre les économies émergentes 
(EME) et malgré des pics périodiques de volatilité, plus fréquemment observés ces derniers temps. 
 
Ensuite, pourquoi l'inflation ou les taux d'intérêt sont-ils si faibles et les politiques en sont-elles 
impactées ? 
Première énigme : l'inflation reste faible dans des pays où le chômage est proche du taux de chômage 
naturel (ou « NAIRU »), comme aux États-Unis, ou dans des pays où l'écart de production a été 
considérablement réduit, comme en Allemagne ; cela peut refléter une pente moins prononcée de la 
courbe de Phillips. Cependant, différentes études du FMI ou de la BDF montrent que, même si les pentes 
ont eu tendance à s’aplatir depuis le début des années quatre-vingt-dix, il n'y a pas eu de modification 
sensible au cours des dernières années. 
Il existe deux explications possibles. L'explication la plus favorable suppose que des chocs 
désinflationnistes transitoires, liés par exemple aux prix des matières premières, déplacent 
temporairement la courbe de Phillips vers le bas. Selon la seconde explication, plus inquiétante, il 
pourrait s'agir d'une perte d’ancrage des anticipations d'inflation à long terme, qui menacerait l'objectif de 
stabilité des prix ; cette perte d’ancrage est suggérée par la surprenante corrélation actuelle entre les prix 
du pétrole au comptant et les anticipations du marché fondées sur les swaps indexés sur l'inflation à 
cinq ans dans cinq ans. Les interprétations peuvent différer et nourrir de sains débats sur les politiques à 
mener. 
3 
 
En ce qui concerne le bas niveau des taux directeurs ou des taux de marché, il est essentiellement perçu 
comme reflétant des taux d'intérêt d'équilibre, ou dits « neutres », plus bas. Cela nous amène à la seconde 
énigme : ce taux d’intérêt neutre plus faible résulte-t-il de facteurs conjoncturels ou structurels ? 
D'une part, ces facteurs peuvent être conjoncturels (ou essentiellement induits par la demande) ; en 
effet, nous constatons actuellement une faible croissance de la demande mondiale et du commerce 
international. Après une crise financière, les facteurs conjoncturels peuvent persister pendant une longue 
période, avec le désendettement d'agents et la réduction des dépenses qu’elle entraîne, par exemple. Dans 
ce cas, les politiques de demande agrégée, y compris la politique monétaire, ont un rôle important à jouer.  
D'autre part, ces facteurs peuvent être structurels (ou essentiellement induits par l'offre) : par exemple, 
liés à des gains de productivité plus faible, à des inégalités plus grandes ou au vieillissement des 
populations, qui entraîne une hausse du taux d'épargne. Parmi les autres suspects habituels qui seraient à 
l'origine d’une stagnation séculaire, on trouve la mondialisation, qui accroît la concurrence prix/salaires, 
ou l'excès d'épargne (savings glut). Et ce dernier peut être involontairement aggravé par les 
réglementations sur la liquidité susceptibles d’augmenter en permanence la demande d'actifs liquides 
sûrs, entraînant ainsi à la baisse les taux sans risque. Dans ce cas, le taux neutre est  
peut-être devenu si négatif que la politique monétaire à elle seule risque de ne pas suffire pour augmenter 
l'inflation. 
Il n’est pas encore possible de trancher mais dans un tel contexte d’incertitude, les mandats des banques 
centrales les poussent à éviter les risques dits du « premier type », liés à l’inaction, plutôt que ceux dits du 
« second type », liés à une proactivité ; en d’autres termes, mieux vaut être prêt à en faire trop plutôt que 
trop peu. En outre, il est possible que la baisse de l'offre découle d'une baisse persistante de la demande, 
avec par exemple une certaine hystérèse entraînant une déqualification des chômeurs et donc une hausse 
du chômage structurel.  
 
II.  Examinons maintenant ce que la politique monétaire doit ou peut faire 
Je souhaite ici évoquer quatre défis : 
Premier défi : si les facteurs en jeu sont mondiaux, que peuvent faire les politiques domestiques? 
Les banques centrales ont des mandats domestiques, alors que la persistance de la « basse-flation » et des 
taux bas suggère que certains facteurs communs ou extérieurs peuvent être à l’œuvre. Cette situation est 
particulièrement problématique pour les plus petites économies ouvertes. Et l'existence d'un « cycle 
financier mondial » à la Rey souligne les limites de la flexibilité des changes pour protéger ces 
économies. 
Les politiques ultra-accommodantes mises en œuvre dans les économies avancées ont incontestablement 
eu des effets de contagion sur les EME, y compris la réduction souvent oubliée (mais bienvenue) des 
spreads dans ces dernières, comme montré par le FMI. Néanmoins, la formulation et l'orientation des 
politiques dans un pays peuvent tenir compte des effets de rétroaction venant d'autres pays. Et il va sans 
4 
 
dire que la situation mondiale aurait été encore pire si les économies avancées étaient entrées en 
déflation. 
Outre la constitution et l'utilisation de réserves de change, les politiques nationales doivent donc 
contribuer à rendre l'économie domestique réelle et son système financier plus résistants aux chocs 
extérieurs. À cet égard, la politique prudentielle visant à mettre en place des coussins ou à protéger les 
institutions financières peut compléter la politique monétaire, à condition que ces mesures ne masquent 
pas une forme de protectionnisme ou une tentative de déglobalisation. 
 
Deuxième défi : que doivent être la cible d’inflation et son horizon? 
Certains économistes ont appelé à ajuster la cible d'inflation, mais dans des directions opposées : 
certains ont plaidé pour une cible plus élevée afin d'éviter de tester souvent la limite à zéro des taux 
d’intérêt ; d'autres ont plaidé pour une cible plus basse, estimant que la « basse-flation » constitue la 
nouvelle situation normale. Dans les deux cas, des changements hâtifs risquent seulement d'affecter la 
crédibilité des banques centrales et le canal des anticipations de la politique monétaire.  
L’horizon de la cible nous laisse plus de flexibilité. Cet horizon est de moyen terme et ne doit pas être 
confondu avec l'horizon à trois ans des prévisions publiées par la BCE par exemple, lequel peut être plus 
court que celui permettant d’atteindre la cible. En fait, ce qui importe est de s’inscrire sur une trajectoire 
cohérente avec ce mandat de moyen terme. La politique consistant à fournir des indications sur la 
trajectoire future des taux directeurs (forward guidance) et l'annonce que les taux seront « plus bas sur 
une période plus longue » devraient rassurer quant à la détermination de la banque centrale de faire « tout 
ce qui est nécessaire » pour remplir sa mission dans le cadre de ce mandat. 
Il est vrai que l'incertitude quant aux causes de la « basse-flation » et des taux d'intérêt bas entraîne celle 
du niveau du taux neutre et donc du besoin de politique accommodante ; plus notre environnement est 
incertain, plus il est important et utile que nous soyons clairs et prévisibles afin de réduire cette 
incertitude.  Selon les simulations effectuées au sein de l'Eurosystème et de la BDF, annoncer clairement 
que l'orientation future restera accommodante pendant de nombreuses années améliore l'efficacité de 
l'assouplissement quantitatif (QE). 
Troisième défi : quelle peut être l’efficacité des mesures monétaires non conventionnelles?  
Nous observons que zéro n’est pas le plancher effectif des taux d’intérêt. Le passage à des taux négatifs a 
nettement abaissé et aplati la courbe des rendements en zone euro, où le financement à long terme est 
particulièrement important. Et jusqu'à présent les arbitrages en faveur des billets sont également restés 
négligeables. Cependant, il existe des limites à ne pas dépasser. La baisse des taux directeurs doit donc 
être combinée à d'autres mesures non conventionnelles. 
En résumé, les BC ont beaucoup innové, à la fois en termes de taux et de quantités. Nous savions que les 
BC pouvaient faire beaucoup et elles ont effectivement fait beaucoup, même si elles ne peuvent pas tout 
faire. 
5 
 
 
Dans les grandes économies avancées, l’évaluation précise de l’effet macroéconomique des achats 
massifs d’actifs fait encore débat ; mais, pour résumer l’analyse partagée au sein de l’Eurosystème et une 
déclaration récente de Mario Draghi, nos achats augmenteront l’inflation d’au moins un demi-point en 
2016 et contribueront à la croissance dans des proportions presque semblables. En ce qui concerne les 
États-Unis, le programme dit QE2, lancé fin 2010, est le plus proche de notre programme 
d’assouplissement quantitatif. Compte tenu de son montant, inférieur d’environ la moitié au montant du 
notre, il a exercé un impact plus ou moins comparable, même si les estimations publiées présentent 
quelques différences. 
 
Quatrième défi : comment traiter le risque d'une sortie mal gérée de la limite à zéro des taux et 
l’instabilité financière ? 
Rester à des niveaux trop bas pendant trop longtemps serait contreproductif: les marges ultra-faibles 
peuvent décourager l'intermédiation financière et les crédits à l'économie réelle, tandis que l'addiction à la 
forward guidance peut réduire au silence les avis contraires et entraver l'information des marchés sur les 
fondamentaux. Néanmoins, la sortie peut être semée d'embûches et, donc, être reportée ou même avortée. 
Pire encore, comme le souligne régulièrement la BRI, garder des niveaux trop bas pendant trop 
longtemps risque d’alimenter la prochaine crise financière puisque l'addiction à la liquidité et la prise de 
risque excessive finissent par entraîner des bulles et l'instabilité financière, alors que la politique 
macroprudentielle risque d’être trop lente pour être utile.  
Même si les politiques monétaire et macroprudentielle sont deux instruments distincts servant deux 
objectifs eux aussi distincts, elles s’influencent mutuellement ; mais il est difficile d'intégrer l'une tout en 
formulant l'autre (par exemple, d'intégrer un « écart de production  soutenable à la Borio » (BRI) dans 
une règle monétaire), dans la mesure où les cycles d'activité et les cycles financiers ne coïncident pas 
souvent. 
Par ailleurs, une sortie intervenant à un mauvais moment ou son anticipation prématurée peuvent 
également mettre en danger certaines institutions financières, en fonction de leur risque de 
transformation. Toutefois, comme les grandes banques centrales ne sortiront pas toutes simultanément,  
cet effet devrait être atténué. Et donc ce qui est parfois décrit comme la « grande divergence » entre les 
politiques monétaires est sans doute au contraire, à mes yeux, une « grande sagesse » : nos cycles 
domestiques sont différents et nos stratégies de sorties seront étalées dans le temps. Ce temps est à 
l’évidence plus lointain pour la zone euro. Mais, nous devrons tous, le moment venu, être aussi 
innovants, aussi prêts à apprendre les uns des autres, aussi décisifs dans l’action quand nous sortirons que 
nous l’avons été en entrant en territoire non conventionnel. 
Pour des raisons de temps, je ne m’étendrai pas sur la question de savoir si des taux ultra-bas altèrent les 
canaux de transmission monétaire ni sur leurs interactions avec la stabilité financière. Comme je l’ai déjà 
6 
 
dit, nous avons toute la journée pour débattre de ces questions complexes grâce à nos intervenants qui 
sont non seulement éminents, mais également ouverts et humbles ; j’ai noté et apprécié ces qualités dans 
leurs récentes interventions explorant les nouveaux territoires où nous sommes. 
Permettez-moi de conclure plutôt sur les limites du champ d’action des banques centrales. De fait, je 
préfère souligner que les banques centrales ne peuvent pas être considérées comme le seul acteur possible 
et, plus précisément, que les politiques monétaire et macroprudentielle ne sont pas conduites dans le vide. 
Les problèmes structurels exigent des réponses structurelles. En particulier, seules des réformes 
structurelles peuvent augmenter la croissance potentielle ; les politiques de la demande agrégée ne 
peuvent pas en fournir de substitut. Ce qu’elles peuvent faire (et c’est précieux) est de permettre de mieux 
gérer le temps. 
À cet égard, je pense que mon temps de parole touche à sa fin et je demande à Christian de nous faire

Discours introductif de François Villeroy de Galhau  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
Colloque sur le financement des TPE   
15 janvier 2016 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je vous souhaite la bienvenue à la Banque de France, pour la tenue de ce Colloque sur le 
financement des très petites entreprises (TPE). Il a été conçu et organisé avec la Fédération 
des centres de gestion agréés, que je tiens à remercier chaleureusement, en particulier son 
président Yves Marmont. Je me félicite de la relation durable et de grande qualité que nous 
avons nouée avec votre organisme dont le rôle est extrêmement précieux pour les PME et 
les TPE y compris pour notre direction générale des statistiques qui a beaucoup contribué à 
ce colloque. Cette manifestation n’aurait pu également avoir lieu sans le concours actif de 
nombreuses personnalités et organismes, qui ont bien voulu constituer les trois tables 
rondes du Colloque. Je les en remercie vivement.  
 
Je dois ajouter qu’il m’est particulièrement agréable d’ouvrir ce Colloque. Comme vous le 
savez, j’ai eu l’honneur il y a quelques mois de remettre un rapport au Premier Ministre sur le 
financement de l’investissement des entreprises, dont la toute première orientation, et elle 
était sincère, était intitulée « Améliorer l’accès des TPE au crédit, et faciliter les crédits de 
trésorerie ». C’est notre sujet d’aujourd’hui. 
 
2 
 
En changeant de fonction, je n’ai pas changé de conviction sur l’importance de ce sujet. Ce 
d’autant plus que la Banque de France est résolument engagée aux côtés des TPE, au 
niveau central mais aussi sur le « terrain », grâce à sa présence en région. L’un des 
bénéfices de ce maillage territorial est précisément de pouvoir être à l’écoute et au service 
des entreprises locales, au premier rang desquelles figurent à l’évidence les TPE.    
 
La Banque de France assure ainsi, dans son réseau de succursales, l’instruction des 
dossiers de la médiation du crédit. Elle éclaire l’ensemble des acteurs économiques et 
sociaux en publiant des statistiques dédiées aux TPE, ce qu’aucune autre Banque centrale 
de l’Eurosystème ne fait à cette échelle. La Banque de France mène aussi des études sur la 
situation financière des TPE et leur positionnement dans l’ensemble du paysage 
économique français. 
  
Ce Colloque n’est donc pas un évènement isolé, qui témoignerait d’un intérêt ponctuel sur un 
sujet médiatique. Il se situe dans la continuité d’une action permanente. Et il donnera 
assurément une impulsion supplémentaire à l’action de la Banque de France. J’y reviendrai 
dans quelques instants.     
*** 
 
Je souhaite auparavant rappeler l’enjeu majeur que le développement des TPE représente 
pour la croissance, l’emploi et la vitalité de notre tissu économique régional. 
 
Les TPE sont, comme vous le savez, usuellement et juridiquement définies comme les 
entreprises de moins de 10 salariés, ayant un chiffre d’affaires annuel ou un total de bilan 
n’excédant pas 2 millions d’euros, tout en n’appartenant pas à un groupe dirigé par une 
entreprise de dimension plus importante.   
 
Les quelque 2,1 millions de TPE représentent 20 % environ des salariés du secteur 
concurrentiel et  créent ensemble près de 20 % de la valeur ajoutée par l’ensemble des 
entreprises. Avec les micro-entrepreneurs, qui disposent d’un régime fiscal et social 
particulier sous la condition que leur chiffre d’affaires soit très limité, on compte plus de 3 
millions d’entreprises.     
 
C’est nettement plus important qu’on ne le pense souvent. C’est donc un poids très 
significatif et au surplus des entreprises présentes sur tout le territoire national, et pas 
seulement dans quelques bassins industriels particulièrement actifs. Les TPE représentent 
aussi un défi -et donc un gisement- pour l’investissement en France : actuellement, on 
3 
 
estime qu’au moins une TPE sur deux n’a investi ni en 2013, ni en 2014. Au total, le 
développement des TPE est essentiel pour la croissance et l’emploi. Mais pour ce faire, il 
faut une volonté d’investir, et un financement suffisamment large. 
 
*** 
Quelles sont les grandes orientations de la Banque de France pour favoriser le 
financement des TPE ?  
 
Elles sont guidées autant par la connaissance des chiffres que par notre perception plus 
qualitative de la réalité « de terrain ». 
 
Globalement, il n’y pas de problème d’accès au crédit pour les entreprises françaises. Au 
contraire, dans leur ensemble, les concours bancaires pour les entreprises progressent plus 
rapidement en France que partout ailleurs en Europe : + 4,5 % en rythme annuel à fin 
novembre 2015, contre + 2,1 % au Royaume-Uni, + 1 % en Allemagne et + 0,9 % en 
moyenne dans la zone euro. 
 
De fait, sur le fondement des réponses des chefs d’entreprises eux-mêmes à nos enquêtes, 
il apparaît que les demandes de crédits à l’investissement sont globalement aisément 
satisfaites, et que la situation est à peu près aussi bonne pour les crédits de trésorerie. 
L’auto-censure, certes particulièrement difficile à mesurer, semble faible. Les enquêtes de la 
BCE aboutissent à des résultats similaires, et placent la France au même niveau que 
l’Allemagne pour ce qui concerne l’accès au crédit et la faiblesse de l’auto-censure, 
nettement devant les autres grands pays de la zone euro. Enfin, les taux des prêts sont en 
France plus bas que partout ailleurs dans la zone euro, avec un différentiel, favorable, 
d’environ 1 point d’intérêt pour les crédits, du montant le plus faible, d’un montant unitaire 
inférieur à 250 000 euros.     
 
Sur notre sujet de ce jour, plusieurs réserves importantes doivent cependant être formulées.  
 
L’accès aux crédits de trésorerie, en particulier, est sensiblement moins bon pour les TPE 
que pour les autres PME :  
- moins de 60 % des demandes de crédits de trésorerie étaient satisfaites (à 75 % ou 
plus) au troisième trimestre 2015, contre 74 % pour les PME par exemple. Il convient 
naturellement de tenir compte de situations financières potentiellement plus fragiles 
mais il s’agit à l’évidence d’un point de vigilance ;  
4 
 
- les crédits aux TPE progressent de 2,8 % par an, en glissement annuel à la fin du 
troisième trimestre 2015, mais les crédits de trésorerie aux TPE n’augmentent que de 
1,1 % en rythme annuel. Par ailleurs, les crédits à l’équipement aux TPE ne 
présentent également qu’une faible croissance, 1,3 %, car les encours sont tirés par 
les crédits immobiliers, qui sont à l’évidence moins porteurs de gains de productivité 
ou de compétitivité.  
 
Tout ne va donc pas bien pour les TPE, et le ressenti « de terrain » ne dit pas autre chose. Il 
est de l’intérêt de tous, banques comme entreprises, de combler ce malentendu sur le 
crédit : du côté des banques, une ambition commerciale affichée ; de l’autre, la persistance 
d’une demande insatisfaite de la part des TPE.  
 
Il importe donc de continuer à améliorer le financement des TPE. Je vous propose d’évoquer 
trois axes de progrès : le premier relève des banques, le second de la Banque de 
France, le troisième des entreprises clientes des TPE. 
 
1) Il est tout d’abord indispensable -a minima- que les cinq engagements, très pertinents, 
pris par les banques pour améliorer le dialogue avec les TPE/PME, en conclusion de 
l’excellent rapport établi par l’Observatoire du financement des entreprises à l’été 2014, 
soient pleinement mis en œuvre.  
 
Je voudrais les rappeler brièvement : 
- répondre à toute demande de financement, sous 15 jours ouvrés à partir du moment 
où le dossier est complet. Cet engagement semble atteint à 90 %
1
, c’est bien ; mais 
les 10 % restants représentent quand même environ 100 000 réponses tardives par 
an, encore ; 
- expliquer le refus de crédit au client TPE ; 
- indiquer les recours existants en cas de dénonciation ou refus de financement ; 
- développer une meilleure information sur le financement du court terme ; 
- favoriser une plus grande stabilité des conseillers TPE dans leurs fonctions. 
 
Je veux en outre saluer en particulier l’établissement par la FBF d’un guide didactique sur le 
financement court terme des TPE. Beaucoup d’entrepreneurs ont besoin en effet de 
connaître et de comprendre les fondements des termes financiers qui sont trop techniques. 
Le malentendu commence souvent par le fait qu’on ne parle pas la même langue : ceci 
                                                          
1
 « Évaluation de la mise en œuvre des 5 mesures prises par la FBF pour améliorer les relations banques-
TPE/PME », rapport remis le 25 novembre 2015. 
5 
 
pénalise le dialogue de proximité des patrons de TPE avec les conseillers bancaires et 
financiers. Par ailleurs, le « guide du routard du crédit », fruit notamment de la collaboration 
entre la Banque de France et le Conseil supérieur de l’ordre des experts comptables, 
participe également de l’information financière des TPE. De même, je salue les efforts 
déployés au sein de l’Observatoire du financement des entreprises, qui vont très 
prochainement aboutir à un glossaire sur la tarification des crédits. Tout cela est hautement 
utile, mais il importe aussi que ces documents soient connus et largement diffusés, tout 
d’abord par les banques elles-mêmes. Et ceci doit permettre d’améliorer la transparence et 
la précision de leurs plaquettes tarifaires.  
 
2) Pour la Banque de France maintenant, il semble nécessaire d’aider davantage les TPE 
avant que les difficultés ne surviennent. La médiation du crédit joue un rôle très efficace, en 
aval, d’aide à la résolution des problèmes financiers des TPE, qui de fait constituent la 
majorité de ses dossiers. Mais il importe aussi et je dirais même surtout, en amont, de 
chercher à prévenir les difficultés.  
 
Nous avons donc décidé que la Banque de France allait, indépendamment au plan juridique 
et opérationnel de l’action curative de la médiation du crédit, contribuer à l’action 
préventive, en nommant dans chaque succursale départementale un Correspondant 
TPE. Le rôle du Correspondant TPE sera d’être un premier point de contact, avec pour 
missions d’accueillir, d’écouter les responsables de TPE en qualité de tiers de confiance, de 
diffuser les outils d’information, dont ceux que je viens de mentionner, de comprendre dans 
leurs grandes lignes la nature des besoins. Il orientera ensuite, en tant que de besoin, et si 
les dirigeants de TPE le souhaitent bien entendu, vers les réseaux professionnels qui, eux, 
délivreront le support adapté : centres de gestion agréés, ordre des experts-comptables, 
associations d’accompagnement du micro-crédit, etc. Toutes les TPE seront les bienvenues, 
y compris bien sûr celles dont l’activité est en essor et qui ont besoin d’informations 
adaptées à leur croissance et à leur taille.   
 
La confidentialité, qui constitue d’ailleurs une valeur et un savoir-faire très forts de la Banque 
de France, sera scrupuleusement respectée : les dirigeants de TPE seront assurés que le 
dialogue qui se nouera restera totalement confidentiel s’ils souhaitent qu’il en soit ainsi.  
 
Sur le plan opérationnel, nous nommerons ces correspondants TPE au printemps 2016 et, 
après une formation adaptée, seront pleinement en fonction à l’automne prochain. 
 
6 
 
En outre, la Banque de France mettra, à l’automne 2016 également, à disposition des 
entreprises un outil d’analyse et de simulation en ligne, dénommé OPALE, permettant 
notamment, avec une portée pédagogique, à un dirigeant d’apprécier la situation financière 
de son entreprise. 
 
3) Je veux évoquer enfin un dernier axe de progrès, lui aussi très important : la réduction 
des délais de paiements des entreprises clientes. La mesure précise en est difficile, 
comme on le sait bien au sein de la Banque de France qui y a contribué depuis de 
nombreuses années, mais tout concorde à montrer que les délais de paiement supportés par 
les entreprises, et notamment par les TPE, représentent des enjeux considérables : 600 
milliards d’euros de créances à la fin 2014, dont environ 420 milliards résultent des délais 
interentreprises … et le solde pour le secteur public. Cette exigence doit bien sûr s’appliquer 
aussi au secteur public national et local. Les différentes enquêtes ou appréciations 
qualitatives montrent que la situation sur les délais de paiement a cessé de s’améliorer 
depuis plusieurs mois et que les délais ne baissent plus, voire ont tendance à augmenter à 
nouveau. Or les délais de paiement représentent pour les dirigeants de TPE non seulement 
un problème financier, mais plus globalement un frein au développement car les relances 
des débiteurs consomment trop de leur temps, qu’ils préfèreraient, à juste titre, employer à 
développer l’activité, à investir.  
 
Le gouvernement a une forte conscience de cet enjeu et mène une action déterminée dans 
ce domaine, avec l’Observatoire des délais de paiement. La Banque de France entend 
contribuer à réduire l’importance de ces difficultés, en promouvant toute la gamme de 
solutions financières adéquates. Elle participera activement, au sein de l’Observatoire du 
financement des entreprises, mais aussi dans le cadre de ses relations courantes avec les 
établissements de crédit et les sociétés de financement, à une réflexion sur les produits 
financiers les plus adaptés à une atténuation de cet obstacle important au développement 
des TPE que sont les délais de paiement. 
 
Toutes ces actions déterminées, que la Banque de France va engager ou auxquelles elle 
apportera son concours, bénéficieront grandement des travaux que vous allez conduire 
aujourd’hui, dans le cadre de ce Colloque. J’en suivrai avec une grande attention les 
résultats, et je vous souhaite un excellent Colloque.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence de la Banque de France  
« Les paiements par carte en Europe : dernières tendances et défis » 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Lundi 18 janvier 2016 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, cher Yves Mersch, cher Mario Nava, 
Tout d’abord, au nom de la Banque de France, je tiens à vous souhaiter chaleureusement la 
bienvenue à Paris. Je suis ravi d'inaugurer cette conférence consacrée aux paiements par carte en 
Europe. Un grand nombre d’acteurs européens impliqués sur le marché des paiements par carte 
sont représentés aujourd’hui, y compris les autorités en charge de la réglementation et les 
intervenants de marché, et je suis convaincu que les débats qui auront lieu nous donneront de 
précieuses informations sur les dernières tendances et sur les défis qu’elles entraînent. Avant de 
donner la parole à nos intervenants et à nos experts, je voudrais simplement partager avec vous 
quelques réflexions sur deux de ces défis, dont l’un s'adresse aux prestataires du marché des 
paiements par carte et l’autre à la communauté en charge de la réglementation. 
 
I. Premier défi: la position dominante des cartes comme instruments de paiement est-
elle durable ? L'instrument de paiement le plus utilisé en Europe continuera-t-il de 
progresser ou diminuera-t-il ? 
Au cours de la dernière décennie, les cartes de paiement ont régulièrement consolidé leur 
domination en tant qu’instruments de paiement scripturaux les plus utilisés en France et en 
Europe. En 2014, les cartes de paiement ont été utilisées pour plus de 47 milliards d’opérations au 
sein de l'Union européenne, soit un niveau presque identique au nombre cumulé de transactions 
impliquant des virements et des prélèvements, qui sont respectivement les deuxième et troisième 
instruments de paiement en termes d’utilisation. En France, les cartes de paiement ont été 
utilisées dans plus de 50 % des opérations de paiements scripturaux, pour un total de près de 
9,5 milliards d'opérations en 2014, contre seulement 3 milliards en 2001. Les paiements par carte 
présentent la spécificité d’être utilisés pour des montants relativement faibles (47 € en moyenne en 
France), ce qui en fait le meilleur substitut aux espèces pour les paiements de proximité.  
 
Cette situation est l’aboutissement d’années d'efforts réalisés par les acteurs du marché en vue 
d’élaborer un instrument de paiement sûr, efficient et pratique. La communauté française a été à 
 
 
2 
 
l’avant-garde de cette évolution avec l’adoption précoce en 1992 des puces électroniques pour les 
cartes de paiement, suivie par l’introduction puis l’adoption généralisée du standard EMV. Cette 
dernière évolution a été décisive pour l’utilisation des cartes de paiement en permettant des 
transactions rapides et sûres dans toute l’Europe. Cette prédominance des cartes de paiement 
peut cependant être remise en question à l’heure actuelle, en raison de la conjonction de trois 
tendances essentielles qui perturbent le marché : de nouvelles solutions, de nouveaux 
comportements et de nouveaux acteurs, de nouvelles réglementations. 
 
En premier lieu, l’émergence de solutions de paiement innovantes basées sur les protocoles 
SEPA est très probable. Un bon exemple à cet égard est la préparation, à l’initiative de l’Euro 
Retail Payments Board (ERPB), d’un système paneuropéen de paiements instantanés élaboré par 
le Conseil européen des paiements (European Payments Council - EPC), sur la base du dispositif 
existant de virements SEPA. Ce nouveau système, qui devrait être finalisé fin 2016 et opérationnel 
avant fin 2017, favorisera le développement de nouveaux produits innovants, notamment via des 
dispositifs intelligents, pour les paiements mobiles et de proximité. Il s’agit d’un exemple pertinent 
de la façon dont le travail d’harmonisation et de standardisation effectué dans le contexte de 
« SEPA 1.0 » pour les anciens instruments de paiement (prélèvement et virement) peut permettre 
aux acteurs du marché d’élaborer de nouvelles solutions de paiement innovantes en temps réel et 
dématérialisées, ce que j’appellerais « SEPA 2.0 ».  
 
En deuxième lieu, nous observons l’apparition de nouveaux comportements de paiement et de 
nouveaux acteurs de marché, en liaison avec de nouvelles innovations technologiques. Cette 
évolution résulte essentiellement de l’importance grandissante du commerce en ligne, qui a 
fondamentalement modifié les habitudes de paiement au cours de ces dernières années. La 
recherche d’un instrument de paiement adapté à ces évolutions a d’abord conduit à une utilisation 
accrue des cartes de paiement, au-delà des transactions de proximité. Ces paiements à distance 
par internet représentent actuellement en France près de 7,5 % du volume total des transactions 
par carte et 11,6 % de leur valeur totale. De nouvelles technologies gagnent néanmoins du 
terrain : elles tirent parti de dispositifs tels que les smartphones et les tablettes et permettent 
d’éliminer les cartes de paiement « plastiques » au profit de portefeuilles virtuels. Ces 
modifications d’ensemble, qui affectent déjà les acteurs traditionnels, sont renforcées par 
l’apparition de nouveaux intervenants, qu’il s'agisse des GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook et 
Amazon) dont on parle tant ou des acteurs plus petits se concentrant sur des services de 
paiement de niche, qui profitent de ces nouvelles technologies pour pénétrer le marché des cartes 
de paiement. À vrai dire, cette « sortie du plastique » est un peu plus lente que prévu il y a 
quelques années, mais il est probable qu’elle s’accélère. 
 
- 3 - 
 
Enfin, en Europe, la troisième tendance qui influence également en profondeur le marché des 
cartes de paiement est la rénovation réglementaire en cours, notamment par la mise en œuvre 
du nouveau règlement relatif aux commissions d’interchange pour les opérations de paiement 
liées à une carte, adopté en avril 2015. Ce nouveau règlement établit, notamment, des plafonds 
pour les commissions d’interchange, de 0,2 % et 0,3 %, respectivement, pour les opérations des 
cartes de débit et des cartes de crédit, ainsi que l’obligation de séparer les systèmes de cartes de 
paiement des entités assurant le traitement des paiements par carte. Ce faisant, ce règlement 
pourrait établir de nouvelles règles du jeu pour les acteurs traditionnels.  
 
Un tel contexte incitera sans aucun doute les fournisseurs traditionnels de solutions de cartes de 
paiement à trouver de nouvelles sources de revenu, en élaborant des services à valeur ajoutée qui 
s’ajouteraient aux seuls paiements, et peut-être en réexaminant la façon dont les paiements sont 
effectués et traités afin de conserver leur avance sur le marché des paiements de masse. 
 
 
II. Le second défi que j'aimerais brièvement commenter est le suivant : quel rôle les 
autorités publiques, et en particulier les banques centrales, doivent-elles jouer ?  
 
Les tendances que je viens de mentionner exigent des autorités publiques, des banques centrales 
en particulier, qu'elles mènent une réflexion sur le rôle qui leur incombe afin d’assurer que 
l'évolution en cours des paiements de détail soutienne la croissance économique et la confiance 
des consommateurs. 
 
1) Le premier moyen pour les banques centrales de contribuer à un tel résultat est de jouer 
leur rôle de catalyseur, en favorisant l’entière coopération et la pleine coordination entre les 
parties prenantes dans les domaines où cela est nécessaire. Ce rôle doit être joué au plan tant 
national qu'européen. 
 
Dans cette perspective, l’ERPB devrait jouer un rôle central en Europe en rassemblant, sous 
l'égide de la BCE et des BCN de l'Eurosystème, les acteurs du côté de l'offre et ceux du côté de la 
demande afin de faciliter le développement d'un marché intégré, innovant et compétitif des 
paiements de masse en euro. Des travaux relatifs aux cartes de paiement ont déjà été menés par 
l’ERPB, notamment sur les phases de normalisation à venir, afin d’ouvrir la voie à d'autres 
mesures que prendront les acteurs de marché au niveau européen. 
 
Pour être efficaces, ces initiatives doivent néanmoins être complétées au niveau national. C'est 
l'une des raisons pour lesquelles une stratégie nationale des systèmes de paiements de masse a 
 
 
4 
 
été élaborée par les parties prenantes en France en octobre dernier et approuvée par le ministre 
des Finances. L'un des axes principaux de cette stratégie vise à faciliter l'utilisation de cartes pour 
les paiements de proximité grâce à la modernisation des terminaux et des infrastructures de 
paiement par carte, ce qui stimulera le développement des paiements sans contact comme 
alternative sûre et efficace au règlement en espèces pour les transactions de tous les jours. Le 
Comité national des paiements, qui prendra le relais du Comité national SEPA dans peu de temps, 
associera, tout comme l’ERPB au niveau européen, l'ensemble des acteurs sous l'égide de la 
Banque de France en vue de favoriser le dialogue nécessaire à une mise en œuvre efficace de la 
stratégie au plan national et de nourrir l’ERPB des contributions de la communauté française. 
 
2) Outre leur rôle de catalyseur, les banques centrales doivent, à travers leur fonction de 
surveillance, viser à assurer que la concurrence entre les intervenants de marché n'entraîne pas 
un nivellement vers le bas mais plutôt une course vers l'excellence en termes de sécurité, en 
fixant des objectifs de haut niveau et en veillant à ce qu’ils soient atteints. De fait, si l'innovation 
constitue une promesse et un vecteur de croissance économique, elle laisse également la porte 
ouverte à de nouvelles menaces pour la sécurité des paiements elle-même et pour la confiance 
que le public place en elle. Les changements des habitudes des clients génèrent de nouveaux 
risques qui ne peuvent à l’heure actuelle être atténués pleinement. Je rappellerai seulement que 
les paiements à distance, qui correspondent « seulement » à un peu moins de 12 % de la valeur 
totale des opérations de paiement par carte en France, représentent plus des deux tiers de la 
valeur globale des paiements par carte de nature frauduleuse. Les chiffres européens sont 
similaires. Les solutions de nouvelle génération pour la protection des paiements pourraient 
commencer à émerger grâce aux travaux menés par le secteur lui-même, je pense au récent 
lancement des cryptogrammes dynamiques par exemple, ainsi qu'au recours à la biométrie, mais 
elles nécessitent également du temps et l’action des régulateurs. 
 
Dans ce contexte, l'adoption de la directive révisée sur les services de paiement en 
décembre 2015 représente une avancée majeure. Cette directive renforcera considérablement la 
sécurité des paiements et des services connexes par l'inscription dans la législation et au plan 
européen de l'obligation d'une authentification renforcée du client pour les opérations de paiement 
électronique ou les services d'accès aux comptes. Cette directive étend également le champ du 
cadre réglementaire européen à de nouvelles activités telles que les services d'initiation 
d’opérations de paiements ou d'information sur les comptes. À cet égard, il est du devoir des 
autorités publiques de garantir une égalité de traitement entre les différents intervenants de 
marché, qu'il s'agisse d'acteurs traditionnels ou de nouveaux venus, par l'intermédiaire 
 
- 5 - 
d'un principe fondamental : réguler selon le profil de risque du service et non selon la 
nature ou le statut du fournisseur de ce service. 
 
La Banque de France a fait figure de précurseur parmi les autorités publiques européennes sur 
ces questions de sécurité depuis la création de l'Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de 
paiement en 2001. Les travaux de cette institution, présidée par le gouverneur de la Banque de 
France depuis ses débuts, ont anticipé et relevé un grand nombre des défis posés par les 
nouvelles technologies, telles que la sécurité des paiements à distance ou sans contact, ou encore 
l'utilisation de la biométrie comme outil d'identification. Néanmoins, dans le contexte actuel de 
profonde transformation du marché des paiements de masse, il apparaît utile d'envisager un 
ajustement des missions de l'Observatoire. Par conséquent, les compétences de l'Observatoire 
devraient être étendues au cours des prochains mois afin de couvrir l'ensemble des instruments 
de paiement scriptural, outre les cartes, et de fournir des recommandations transversales mieux 
adaptées aux besoins du marché.  
 
Je conclurai en vous souhaitant des discussions fructueuses et animées sur l'ensemble de ces 
aspects, dans l'espoir que cette conférence nous donne une vision exhaustive des dernières 
tendances et des défis qui devront être relevés pour les moyens de paiement en Europe, mais 
aussi des différentes solutions pouvant être envisagées à l'heure actuelle. Je cède maintenant la 
place à nos orateurs principaux, M. Yves Mersch, membre du directoire de la Banque centrale 
européenne, et M. Mario Nava, directeur de la Régulation et supervision prudentielle des 
institutions financières à la Commission européenne, qui nous présenteront leur point de vue sur le 
marché des cartes de paiement au niveau européen. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Vœux à la Place 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau – 18 janvier 2016 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
Merci d’avoir répondu à notre invitation dans cette Galerie dorée magnifiquement 
restaurée. C’est une première pour moi dans cette fonction, mais c’est une heureuse tradition qui 
nous réunit. Je formule d’abord bien sûr, des vœux personnels chaleureux pour vous-mêmes, 
vos proches mais également pour l’ensemble des collaborateurs de vos institutions et de vos 
établissements.  
L’année 2016 a commencé comme celle de la volatilité : faiblesse des marchés financiers 
et des matières premières, depuis la Chine et le Moyen-Orient ; incertitudes politiques en Europe, 
au Sud, à l’Est, au Nord-Ouest avec le référendum britannique, et même au centre avec la crise 
des réfugiés. Nous avons un devoir de vigilance, mais nous avons deux autres impératifs : 
d’abord distinguer le fond du buzz, les vrais défis –et il n’en manque pas– des déclarations 
fracassantes et parfois excessives de ce début d’année ; ensuite tenir, face à la volatilité de 
l’instant, nos caps de moyen terme. Je ne parlerai pas ce soir de la politique monétaire de 
l’Eurosystème car nous sommes en « période de réserve » avant le Conseil des Gouverneurs de 
jeudi. Cette ambition de long terme doit valoir aussi pour les réformes en Europe et en France. 
Je voudrais dès lors élargir mes vœux personnels à trois vœux collectifs : pour notre pays 
et son économie d’abord ; pour son bon financement ensuite ; pour la stabilité financière et la 
solidité de vos établissements enfin. 
 
2 
 
1) Nous sommes aujourd’hui dans un mouvement de reprise confirmé, avec pour 2015 
plus de 1 % de croissance en France, et 1,5 % dans la zone euro. En 2016, malgré les 
incertitudes, tout indique que la croissance devrait être supérieure. La France doit désormais 
transformer cette reprise modeste mais réelle en une croissance forte, durable et créatrice 
d’emplois. Cela nécessite de remplir deux conditions en 2016 : poursuivre les réformes publiques, 
et amplifier l’investissement des entreprises.  
Sur les réformes, la France est aujourd’hui pénalisée par l’endettement excessif de son 
secteur public (25% du PIB d’écart avec l’Allemagne, alors que nous étions au même niveau en 
2010) et la détérioration de sa balance commerciale et de sa compétitivité. La bataille pour la 
croissance et contre le chômage se gagne dans la durée, avec cette grande vertu qu’est la 
continuité. Il ne faut donc rien lâcher sur la maîtrise des dépenses publiques et tenir bon sur ce 
qui commence à marcher : le Pacte de responsabilité et le CICE devraient nous permettre de 
rattraper, sur 2014-2017, un tiers de notre retard de compétitivité sur l’Allemagne accumulé sur 
les premières années de l’euro (1999-2007). La transformation du CICE en baisse définitive de 
charges serait très bienvenue. Mais il faut faire davantage ; les chômeurs et les jeunes n’ont pas 
le temps d’attendre. Au-delà des plans d’urgence, il est au moins quatre réformes d’évidence, 
parce qu’elles ont réussi chez nos voisins européens: l’apprentissage, massivement ; les 
simplifications, y compris en matière de droit du travail ; le développement de l’entrepreneuriat ; 
et enfin la décentralisation du dialogue social au niveau de l’entreprise, au plus près de la réalité 
économique et humaine. 
L’investissement des entreprises dépend d’abord de la volonté et de la confiance de 
milliers d’entrepreneurs, mais il doit bien sûr être favorisé par le financement… et donc par vous.  
 
2) Ceci me conduit aux vœux pour un bon financement, dans un contexte de taux 
bas persistants. La politique monétaire porte en effet ses fruits : en dix-huit mois, depuis juin 
2014 et l’annonce des politiques non conventionnelles, le taux des crédits bancaires aux 
entreprises a baissé d’environ 80 pb en ZE, et leur encours est passé d’un recul de -2,5 % en juin 
2014 à une croissance de +0,9 % en novembre 2015. Selon les estimations, incluant les 
décisions du 3 décembre dernier, la politique non conventionnelle augmente la perspective de 
croissance de la ZE de 1 % sur la période 2015-2017, et celle d’inflation de 0,5 pp en 2016 et 0,3 
pp en 2017.  
Le crédit bancaire dès lors doit rester accessible. Les banques françaises ont ici leur 
part de résultats appréciables. Les concours bancaires pour les entreprises progressent plus 
3 
 
rapidement en France que partout ailleurs en Europe : +4,5 % en rythme annuel à fin novembre 
2015, contre +1 % en Allemagne, +0 % en Italie. En outre, les taux d’intérêt en France sont parmi 
les plus bas d’Europe. Le taux des nouveaux crédits bancaires est aujourd’hui inférieur à 2 % en 
moyenne, contre 5 % en 2007. Toutefois, j’appelle votre attention sur l’accès plus difficile des 
TPE aux crédits de trésorerie. Leur situation financière fragile peut jouer ; mais ici persiste un 
malentendu avec les banques que celles-ci ont tout intérêt à traiter sérieusement. 
L’épargne des Français, elle aussi, doit s’adapter aux taux bas. C’est une opportunité 
d’encourager une épargne plus « à risque » et plus à long terme, dans l’intérêt tant des 
épargnants eux-mêmes que de notre économie. Aujourd’hui, seuls 31 % des placements 
financiers des ménages sont constitués d’actifs risqués, contre 45 % dans la Zone Euro. Il faut 
pour cela agir dans deux directions : répercuter progressivement la baisse des taux sur la 
rémunération de l’épargne sans risque – c’est pourquoi j’ai proposé la baisse des taux du PEL, et 
c’est pourquoi il faut poursuivre résolument  la baisse des rendements de l’assurance vie investie 
en fonds euro. La deuxième direction, c’est le développement de produits nouveaux : moins 
liquides sans doute, assortis ou non d’une protection en capital sur le long terme, et pouvant 
bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions sur la durée. Et il faut à tout le moins éviter des 
distorsions fiscales au détriment de ces produits par rapport à l’épargne liquide et sans risque. Il 
reste d’autant plus essentiel d’éclairer pleinement chaque investisseur sur les risques dans 
lesquels il investit son épargne ; je pense, pour ne citer que deux exemples aujourd’hui, aux 
contrats en unités de compte, ou aux gestionnaires qui proposent des financements 
désintermédiés. 
 
3) Mon troisième et dernier vœu collectif pour l’année 2016 est celui de la stabilité 
financière, et de la solidité de vos établissements.  
Depuis la crise financière, le cadre réglementaire, ainsi que l’architecture de supervision 
et de surveillance, ont été considérablement renforcés. Il le fallait, nul je crois n’en doute ici. Pour 
le secteur bancaire, ce sont en particulier la mise en œuvre de la réglementation Bâle 3 / 
CRD4-CRR, la finalisation du TLAC nouvelle arme antichoc, et l’union bancaire européenne, 
avec désormais deux mécanismes effectifs : la supervision, et –depuis le 1
er
 janvier- la résolution 
uniques. Aujourd’hui les banques françaises sont plus solides : leur ratio de solvabilité core Tier 1 
est en moyenne de 12 % en septembre 2015, contre 6 % fin 2007. Et contrairement aux craintes 
qui ont souvent été exprimées, y compris par certains d’entre vous, la situation actuelle montre 
que ces règles n’ont pas pesé sur le crédit et la croissance, notamment en raison des effets 
favorables de la politique monétaire. 2016 doit marquer le temps de l’achèvement des chantiers 
4 
 
encore ouverts. En particulier pour assurer une meilleure comparabilité des modèles internes –et 
donc leur meilleure crédibilité–, et non pour augmenter substantiellement les exigences globales 
de capital. Pour finaliser et stabiliser Bâle 3, et non pour ouvrir un nouveau Bâle 4.   
Le secteur des assurances n’est pas en reste. L’entrée en application de la réforme 
réglementaire européenne Solvabilité 2, au 1
er
 janvier aussi, marque une profonde rupture. 
« Solva 2 » est perfectible, nous le savons tous ; mais c’est un progrès sensible. À cet égard, il 
est important que tous les organismes poursuivent leurs efforts en matière de gouvernance et de 
qualité des estimations et de données remises au superviseur, pour permettre un suivi adéquat 
des risques, en particulier ceux associés à la persistance de taux d’intérêt très bas. Sur le plan 
international, d’autres défis devront être relevés, notamment la définition des groupes 
systémiques –elle doit être équitable en transatlantique, j’y suis sensible comme vous–, 
l’exigence harmonisée de capital et les stratégies de résolution. 
Mais la solidité du système financier ne passe pas uniquement par les règlementations 
prudentielles. Elle passe aussi par la confiance que les acteurs économiques et l’opinion 
publique, les ménages et les entreprises, ont dans leur système financier. Les efforts des 
établissements financiers pour la protection de leur clientèle sont ici indispensables. Il faut en 
2016, en particulier, une mise en œuvre résolue de la loi Eckert sur les comptes bancaires 
inactifs et les contrats d’assurance vie en déshérence, et une meilleure liberté de choix de 
l’assurance emprunteurs sur les crédits immobiliers. Et il faut bien sûr, plus que jamais, lutter 
contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement du terrorisme. De nouvelles dispositions 
ont déjà été prises, certaines sont en cours de renforcement. J’attends des établissements 
financiers –assureurs comme banquiers– une participation exemplaire à ce combat. Je la sais 
entièrement acquise dans son principe, mais elle doit se traduire sans attendre dans la gestion 
quotidienne ; c’est votre intérêt tant le risque de conformité est devenu aussi vital, aussi 
stratégique, que le risque de crédit. 
 
Que vos établissements soient solides sur ces deux fronts ; que notre pays soit aussi 
engagé dans la bataille économique que dans la lutte contre le terrorisme, avec notre 
contribution à tous ; et que chacun de vous vive ainsi une année 2016 vigilante et active, mais 
aussi sereine que possible. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence annuelle du marché boursier : Innovation et mutation 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
19 janvier 2016 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de répondre à l’invitation de Stéphane Boujnah, et de 
participer à cette conférence annuelle, dont le sujet est central pour l’économie française 
aujourd’hui. Notre économie, qui se situe à la frontière technologique, doit pouvoir innover 
toujours plus – et donc se transformer, muter - pour relever ses perspectives de croissance. 
En conséquence, l’investissement des entreprises, qui est l’une des clés de l’innovation, doit 
pouvoir trouver des financements nouveaux. Cela ne veut pas dire que le financement 
traditionnel par le crédit bancaire n’est plus nécessaire, loin de là. Mais cela signifie que 
l’offre doit pouvoir se diversifier pour répondre aux besoins de financement des entreprises, 
quels que soient leur taille, leur âge ou leur secteur. Et bien évidemment, dans ce domaine, 
Euronext et la communauté financière dans son ensemble ont un rôle essentiel à jouer. Mais 
avant d’aborder plus en détail ces leviers financiers de l’investissement des entreprises, je 
voudrais d’abord revenir sur les leviers économiques qui précèdent les besoins de 
financement.  
 
I. Dans le domaine économique, où en est-on en France et dans la zone euro et 
comment « transformer l’essai » ?  
L’année 2016 a commencé comme celle de la volatilité : faiblesse des marchés financiers et 
des matières premières, depuis la Chine et le Moyen-Orient ; incertitudes politiques en 
Europe, au Sud, à l’Est, au Nord-Ouest avec le référendum britannique, et même au centre 
avec la crise des réfugiés. Nous avons un devoir de vigilance, mais nous avons deux autres 
impératifs : d’abord distinguer le fond du buzz, les vrais défis –et il n’en manque pas– des 
déclarations fracassantes et parfois excessives de ce début d’année ; ensuite tenir, face à la 
volatilité de l’instant, nos caps de moyen terme. Je ne parlerai pas ce soir de la politique 
monétaire, puisque nous sommes dans la période de réserve avant le Conseil des 
2 
 
Gouverneurs de jeudi. Mais cette ambition de long terme doit valoir pour toute la politique 
économique, y compris la nécessité des réformes. 
 
a) Nous sommes aujourd’hui dans un mouvement de reprise confirmé, avec pour 2015 
plus de 1 % de croissance en France, et 1,5 % dans la zone euro. En 2016, malgré les 
incertitudes, tout indique que la croissance devrait être supérieure. En dépit de 
l’affaiblissement des grands pays émergents, l’économie française et européenne devrait 
continuer à bénéficier de la conjonction exceptionnelle de trois impulsions : (i) la baisse 
significative des prix du pétrole et des matières premières (de respectivement –45 % et  
–31 %, en dollars, entre le 1
er
 janvier 2015 et le 14 janvier 2016) ; (ii) l’évolution à la baisse 
du taux de change de l’euro par rapport au dollar (-10 % sur la même période) ; (iii) et des 
taux d’intérêt très bas (- 80 pb sur le taux des crédits bancaires, depuis juin 2014). 
 
La politique monétaire non conventionnelle que nous avons menée en Europe depuis juin 
2014 a fait beaucoup pour notre économie. Nous avons maintenant des estimations fiables 
et convergentes de son efficacité : elle augmente la perspective de croissance de la zone 
euro d’environ 1 % sur la période 2015-2017, et celle d’inflation de 0,5 pp en 2016 et 0,3 pp 
en 2017.  Tout cela est beaucoup… et à cette aune notre performance de croissance reste 
insuffisante : moins que ne devraient le permettre ces stimuli économiques exceptionnels, et 
moins que la moyenne européenne. 
 
b) Il faut désormais transformer la reprise économique trop modérée que nous 
connaissons en une croissance forte, durable et créatrice d’emplois. Cela passe 
notamment par une relance de l’investissement des entreprises.  
En France aujourd’hui, ce n’est pas la quantité de l’investissement qui pose problème, 
puisque le taux d’investissement des sociétés non financières, à 22,9 % en 2015, est plutôt 
bon par rapport à sa moyenne de long terme, à savoir 21,4 % depuis 1980. Mais c’est sa 
qualité et sa productivité qui font défaut pour pouvoir soutenir la croissance : beaucoup de 
construction, pas assez de machines et équipements ou de recherche et développement.  
 
La relance de l’investissement productif ne se décrète pas d’en haut : elle passe par les 
décisions de milliers d’entrepreneurs. Mais tous sont sensibles avant tout à trois leviers. 
Premièrement, les perspectives de croissance, puisque les carnets de commande,  
c’est-à-dire la demande ou le PIB attendus, sont la motivation principale de l’investissement. 
Pour augmenter la croissance à moyen terme en France, les réformes structurelles sont 
indispensables. Nous connaissons aujourd’hui les handicaps de la France : le fort 
endettement de son secteur public, la détérioration de sa compétitivité, la lourdeur de ses 
3 
 
procédures. Nous connaissons aussi les solutions : elles ont marché chez nos voisins 
européens, la Suède des années 1990, l’Allemagne des années 2000, l’Espagne des 
années 2010. Deuxième levier, la confiance. L’incertitude est l’ennemie de l’investissement. 
Pour la réduire, il faut viser la simplification, la stabilité et la visibilité des règles. Enfin, 
troisième levier, la rentabilité. Ce facteur joue le plus directement pour beaucoup de PME qui 
sont sensibles au volume de leur autofinancement. 
 
II. Cependant, si les leviers économiques sont premiers dans les décisions 
d’investissement des entreprises, les leviers financiers ont également un rôle 
important à jouer.  
 
a) Aujourd’hui, nos entreprises ont besoin de financements mieux adaptés : notre défi 
est le financement en fonds propres plus que la dette.  Pour que les investissements 
puissent être de plus en plus tournés vers l’innovation, et donc, de fait, de plus en plus 
risqués, il faut que les financements évoluent. À investissements innovants, 
financements nouveaux. Les entreprises européennes ont donc non seulement besoin de 
crédits moins garantis, mais également, pour les entreprises en création ou en croissance, 
de davantage de fonds propres. En effet, les fonds propres ont deux atouts : ils permettent 
d’une part au créateur de disposer de fonds durables et d’autre part à l’investisseur d’avoir 
un fort potentiel d’appréciation par rapport au risque qu’il prend. Une économie en rattrapage 
– comme l’Europe jusqu’aux années 1980, ou beaucoup de pays émergents aujourd’hui – 
peut se financer par dette. Une économie à la frontière technologique, qui suppose plus de 
risques, doit se financer davantage par fonds propres. Or, dans la zone euro la structure de 
financement des entreprises reste majoritairement centrée sur la dette plutôt que sur les 
fonds propres. À titre de comparaison, les fonds propres nets des sociétés non financières 
représentent 123 % du PIB aux États-Unis, contre 52 % en zone euro. Cet écart 
transatlantique, peu cité, est plus significatif encore que le taux de désintermédiation de la 
dette : les fameux 20 % de financements de marché européens face aux 75 % américains.  
 
b) Pour ce qui concerne la dette, la situation en France est aujourd’hui globalement 
satisfaisante. D’une part, les financements bancaires restent accessibles. D’abord en 
volume, puisque les concours bancaires pour les entreprises progressent plus rapidement en 
France que partout ailleurs en Europe : + 4,5 % en rythme annuel à fin novembre 2015, 
contre + 2,1 % au Royaume-Uni, + 1,0 % en Allemagne, + 0,0 % en Italie et + 0,9 % en 
moyenne dans la zone euro. En outre, les taux d’intérêt en France sont parmi les plus bas 
d’Europe. Le taux d’intérêt nominal des nouveaux crédits bancaires est aujourd’hui inférieur 
à 2 % en moyenne, contre environ 5 % en 2007. Enfin, l’accès des PME au crédit 
4 
 
d’investissement est bon : le taux de satisfaction des demandes en France (c’est-à-dire 
obtention du crédit en totalité ou à plus de 75 %) atteignait 92 % au troisième trimestre 2015 
selon l’enquête menée par la Banque de France, même s’il faut progresser sur les TPE.  
 
D’autre part, les financements obligataires se développent. Le mouvement de diversification 
des sources de financement par la dette est plus marqué en France que chez ses voisins 
européens, avec un recours accru à l’endettement de marché. Le taux de désintermédiation, 
c’est-à-dire la part des financements obligataires dans l’endettement financier des 
entreprises, est passé de 24,2 % en 2008 à 38,6 % en 2015, alors qu’il n’atteignait à la 
même date que 14,1 % en Allemagne et 13,5 % en Italie. Néanmoins, en France, 
l’endettement de marché concerne toujours essentiellement les grandes entreprises, pour 
qui le financement obligataire représente environ 70 % de leur endettement financier contre 
environ 25 % pour les entreprises de taille intermédiaire et moins de 5 % pour les PME. Pour 
autant, une désintermédiation forcée aurait peu de sens : il doit s’agir d’une diversification 
optionnelle des financements, déterminée par la demande des entreprises elles-mêmes et 
non pas imposée selon un calendrier et des objectifs prédéterminés.  
 
c) Le développement prioritaire du financement par les fonds propres passe par 
plusieurs canaux.  Du côté des fonds propres « internes », c’est-à-dire de 
l’autofinancement, les perspectives s’améliorent. Pour les PME en particulier, 
l’autofinancement est crucial car il reste le principal outil de financement de leurs 
investissements, même quand l’endettement est disponible. À cet égard, la baisse du taux 
de marge des entreprises françaises depuis 2008 a été un sujet d’alerte. Mais elle a été bien 
identifiée et traitée par le crédit d’impôt compétitivité emploi (CICE) et le pacte de 
responsabilité et de solidarité. Ces réformes permettent une amélioration effective du taux de 
marge des entreprises, qui passerait de 29,5 % en 2014 à plus de 32 % en 2017.  
 
Du côté des fonds propres « externes », vous êtes bien sûr au cœur de l’action. Euronext 
en tant que principale place boursière pan-européenne, a un rôle central à jouer dans le 
financement par les marchés des entreprises, par la dette bien sûr, mais surtout par les 
fonds propres. À cet égard, je salue la volonté d’Euronext –supervisé par l’AMF avec qui la 
Banque de France travaille en excellente coopération- de ramener les investisseurs en 
Bourse, mais également celle d’orienter les entreprises de toutes tailles et de tous secteurs 
sur les marchés. Sur les trois premiers trimestres de l’année 2015, Euronext a ainsi permis la 
cotation de 38 entreprises, pour un total de 82,9 Md€ de fonds propres et de dette levés sur 
les marchés primaire et secondaire. Sa filiale EnterNext, dédiée à la promotion et au 
développement des PME-ETI, a permis l’introduction en bourse de 26 PME-ETI et la levée 
5 
 
de 6 Md€ sur la même période. Vous contribuez ainsi à deux réconciliations essentielles : 
celle des entreprises et de la finance, et celle des Français et du risque. Vous le faites avec 
une dimension européenne, mais je le dis clairement : avoir une place forte dans les 
infrastructures de marché est décisif pour l’économie française.  
 
Je voudrais dépasser Euronext avec deux orientations plus générales en faveur des fonds 
propres. 
 
L’épargne des Français, d’une part, doit s’adapter à l’environnement actuel de taux bas. 
C’est une opportunité d’encourager une épargne plus « à risque » et plus à long terme, dans 
l’intérêt tant des épargnants eux-mêmes que de notre économie. Aujourd’hui, seuls 31 % 
des placements financiers des ménages sont constitués d’actifs risqués, contre 45 % dans la 
zone Euro. Il faut pour cela agir dans deux directions : répercuter progressivement la baisse 
des taux sur la rémunération de l’épargne sans risque – c’est pourquoi j’ai proposé la baisse 
des taux du PEL, et c’est pourquoi il faut poursuivre résolument la baisse des rendements de 
l’assurance vie investie en fonds euro. La deuxième direction, c’est le développement de 
produits nouveaux : moins liquides sans doute, assortis ou non d’une protection en capital 
sur le long terme, et pouvant bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions sur la durée. Et il 
faut à tout le moins éviter des distorsions fiscales au détriment de ces produits par rapport à 
l’épargne liquide et sans risque. Cette neutralité fiscale devrait, symétriquement, se retrouver 
du côté des entreprises financées : éviter de favoriser le financement par dette plutôt que par 
capitaux propres… et nous savons qu’il y a du chemin à faire. 
 
D’autre part, pour favoriser le financement par les fonds propres, il faut développer les flux 
de capitaux transfrontières en zone euro. L’un des grands paradoxes de la zone euro est 
que l’investissement y est trop faible, alors même que l’épargne y est globalement 
abondante : la zone euro bénéficie d’un fort excédent courant, plus de 300 Md€ par an, soit 
plus de 3 % du PIB sur la période de quatre trimestres s’achevant au troisième trimestre 
2015. Le problème est que l’épargne circule mal entre les différents pays de la zone euro du 
fait de la fragmentation financière. Cette situation a des conséquences graves. Elle crée un 
manque à croître, puisque l’excédent d’épargne des pays cœur ne rencontre pas la 
demande d’investissement des pays périphériques. Elle crée également une fragilité de la 
zone euro, étant donné que les chocs nationaux ne sont amortis ni par des transferts 
budgétaires, en l’absence d’union budgétaire, ni par des flux privés durables. À titre de 
comparaison, aux États-Unis, les flux de capitaux entre les États fédérés permettent 
d’amortir les chocs à hauteur de 39 %, alors que les transferts publics ne jouent qu’à hauteur 
6 
 
de 13 %1. Il s’agit bien de flux en fonds propres, et non en crédit : ils sont en effet beaucoup 
plus efficaces pour amortir les chocs, puisqu’ils opèrent un véritable partage du risque 
transfrontière.   
 
Une bonne part de la solution se joue à l’échelle européenne avec le projet d’Union des 
marchés de capitaux (UMC) porté par la Commission européenne. Cependant, ses objectifs 
et son ambition doivent être plus clairement définis pour assurer son succès. C’est pourquoi 
il me paraît préférable de parler d’Union de financement et d’investissement, pour deux 
raisons : d’abord parce que les marchés de capitaux ne sont qu’un outil – c’est le bon 
financement de l’investissement qui est l’objectif principal – ; ensuite, parce que les canaux 
de financement doivent rester divers – les marchés de capitaux devront s’articuler avec les 
banques, ainsi qu’avec les fonds propres « privés » souscrits directement par les assureurs 
et gestionnaires d’actifs. L’Union de financement et d’investissement doit être la 
consolidation en synergie de l’UMC, de l’Union bancaire et du plan Juncker. Cela permettrait 
de développer encore davantage l’investissement en fonds propres transfrontières, et de 
partager nos risques au travers de mécanismes innovants comme un venture capital 
européen.  
 
Je conclurai par une remarque plus générale. Parfois la menace du fatalisme nous guette : 
notre croissance dépendrait principalement de la Chine, et l’innovation serait l’apanage des 
États-Unis. Notre environnement international compte, certes, mais notre destin économique 
dépend d’abord de nous-mêmes, de notre capacité à innover et à nous réformer. Dans cette 
mutation, le financement n’a qu’une part, et une part qui est au service de l’économie et des 
entreprises. Mais c’est une part importante et je suis heureux que cette conférence lui ait 
donné toute sa place. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

25es Rencontres parlementaires de l’Épargne 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 2 février 2016 
 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de participer à ces 25es Rencontres parlementaires de l’Épargne. 
Avant de répondre à vos questions,  je voudrais partager avec vous un constat et quelques pistes 
de réflexion.  
 
I- Le constat d’abord, c’est qu’en France, l’épargne est abondante mais qu’elle ne finance 
pas assez l’investissement et donc la croissance.  
 
a) En France, l’épargne ne manque pas. Le taux d’épargne des ménages y est l’un des plus élevés 
de la zone euro, à 15,2 %
1 au troisième trimestre 2015, contre 12,7 % dans la zone euro. Une 
forte majorité en est investie dans l’immobilier, mais près de 7 % des revenus des ménages sont 
utilisés pour réaliser des placements financiers. Ceux-ci représentent près de 4400 milliards 
d’euros d’encours à fin septembre 2015, soit deux fois le PIB. 
 
b) Cependant, les épargnants français privilégient de plus en plus les placements sûrs, 
c’est-à-dire principalement les dépôts bancaires et l’épargne réglementée, en soi très liquide, et  
les fonds euros des contrats d’assurance-vie, essentiellement orientés vers des produits 
obligataires : 63 % du patrimoine financier des ménages au T3 2015 contre 56 % en 2006. En 
comparaison, le poids des actifs risqués
2
 dans le patrimoine des ménages est supérieur dans la 
zone euro à ce qu’il est en France (89 % du PIB contre 74 % au T4 2014), et près de trois fois et 
demie supérieur aux États-Unis (250 % du PIB). Une bonne part de l’écart avec les États-Unis 
s’explique par l’importance des fonds de pension, mais la détention d’actions par les ménages y 
est aussi nettement plus élevée. 
 
c) Cela crée d’une part un rendement plus faible de l’épargne des Français, étant donné le 
contexte de taux d’intérêt bas, et d’autre part une perte de croissance économique, car 
l’épargne ne finance pas assez les investissements innovants des entreprises, qui nécessitent 
plus de fonds propres, au premier rang desquels les actions. Je voudrais vous donner à ce propos 
un chiffre de comparaison : aux États-Unis, les fonds propres nets des sociétés non financières 
représentent 123 % du PIB ; cette part n’est que de 52 % en moyenne dans la zone euro,  
c’est-à-dire plus de deux fois moins, et de 66 % en France. L’enjeu est donc le suivant : comment 
inciter les épargnants français à prendre davantage de risque raisonné, pour mieux financer 
notre économie ? Le contexte monétaire et financier conduit d’autant plus à renouveler la 
question : les taux sont bas et le resteront pour un temps significatif. Ne voyez pas ici un 
pronostic trop précis de politique monétaire, mais c’est ce qui est adapté aujourd’hui pour notre 
                                                     
1 Données brutes lissées sur 4 trimestres. 
2 Les actifs risqués sont définis ici comme comprenant les titres de créances, actions cotées, actions non cotées et autres 
participations, titres d’OPC non monétaires, parts de fonds de pension et parts d’assurance-vie en supports UC. Les actifs non 
risqués regroupent le numéraire, les dépôts à vue, les dépôts à terme, les titres d’OPC monétaires et les parts d’assurance-vie 
en supports euros. 
2 
 
situation d’inflation, pour notre économie, et pour la croissance. Les taux bas représentent une 
incitation à la diversification de l’épargne, mais nous sommes tous conscients qu’il y a là des 
enjeux lourds. Je voudrais donc, sans prétendre encore à des conclusions tranchées, livrer trois 
lignes de réflexion pour ce débat nécessaire. 
 
II – Il faut agir dans deux directions et veiller à une précaution essentielle.  
 
a) Il faut d’abord répercuter progressivement la baisse des taux d’intérêt sur la 
rémunération de l’épargne sans risque. C’est pourquoi j’ai proposé la baisse des taux des 
nouveaux PEL, fixés à 1,5 % depuis hier, et c’est pourquoi il faudra poursuivre résolument la 
baisse des rendements de l’assurance-vie investie en fonds euro, au-delà des baisses annoncées 
cette année.  
 
b) La deuxième direction, c’est le développement de produits nouveaux. Soyons clairs : les 
épargnants français et européens ne deviendront pas « américains » dans leurs comportements 
et leur appétit au risque. Ces différences transatlantiques ont des racines historiques, culturelles 
et sociologiques. Il ne nous appartient pas ici de les explorer, et moins encore de les transformer. 
Mais le débat français gagnerait à beaucoup mieux distinguer deux aspirations des 
épargnants dans leur aversion au risque : la sécurité et la liquidité. Sur la sécurité,  
c'est-à-dire la protection du capital, l'attachement des épargnants est fort. La pleine prise de 
risques, avec les perspectives de plus-values associées, restera donc sans doute le fait d'une 
minorité. Sur la liquidité par contre, avec la prolongation de la durée de vie, la baisse du taux de 
remplacement des retraites, ou encore l’accroissement des risques liés au grand âge, les Français 
ont de plus en plus des perspectives de long terme. Il faut donc pouvoir leur proposer des 
produits d’épargne adaptés : moins liquides, assortis ou non d’une protection en capital sur le 
long terme, et pouvant bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions sur la durée. Et il faut à tout 
le moins éviter des distorsions fiscales au détriment de ces produits par rapport à l’épargne 
liquide et sans risque. Cette neutralité fiscale devrait, symétriquement, se retrouver du côté des 
entreprises financées : éviter de favoriser le financement par dette plutôt que par capitaux 
propres. 
 
c) La troisième réflexion porte sur une précaution essentielle : il est important de renforcer la 
transparence et l’information des épargnants sur le couple « rendement-risque » de leurs 
investissements à différents horizons. C’est le rôle-même des intermédiaires financiers que 
de mutualiser l’épargne, c’est-à-dire d’assurer la transformation entre des passifs prudents  
- l’épargne - et des actifs plus risqués - l’investissement. Mais c’est le devoir des professionnels 
que de bien éclairer leurs clients sur la nature des investissements réalisés, y compris via les 
contrats d’assurance-vie multisupports (et notamment les contrats en unités de compte). Quant 
aux financements désintermédiés, comme le crowdfunding qui attire de plus en plus 
d’épargnants, ce sont là aussi des instruments utiles, mais leur commercialisation doit se faire en 
éclairant le client sur le risque pris et en l’incitant à diversifier son patrimoine. 
 
Je conclurai par deux remarques plus générales :  
- Pour mieux cerner « l’épargne dans tous ses états », pour reprendre le thème des 
rencontres d’aujourd’hui, il faut aussi la considérer dans toutes ses dimensions : une 
dimension française, c’est évident, mais également une dimension européenne, car une 
bonne part des solutions se joue aussi à ce niveau. Je suis convaincu que nous pouvons 
créer dans la zone euro une « Union de financement et d’investissement » qui soit 
bénéfique pour les épargnants comme pour les entreprises, si nous faisons aller dans le 
même sens le projet d’Union des marchés de capitaux porté par la Commission 
européenne, le plan Juncker et l’Union bancaire. C’est une autre voie prometteuse pour 
mieux orienter l’épargne des ménages, mieux mutualiser les risques et ainsi mieux 
financer l’économie.  
- Ce débat sur l’épargne est à la fois techniquement complexe, et légitimement passionné  
car il touche au patrimoine des Français. Le Parlement a beaucoup travaillé sur ces 
3 
 
thèmes avec plusieurs rapports essentiels. Il ne m’appartient pas de décider du 
calendrier ni des modalités, mais je souhaite que notre pays sache mener une réflexion 
d’ensemble sur son épargne, « à froid ». L’épargne est une de nos premières ressources, 
disponible en abondance ; l’investissement des entreprises est un de nos premiers 
besoins. Ne manquons pas cette chance, dans le contexte des taux bas.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention et suis prêt à répondre à vos questions.

House of Finance Days de l’Université Paris-Dauphine  
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau 
14 mars 2016 
« Que peut faire la politique monétaire ? » 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de participer à cette première édition des House of Finance Days 
de l’Université Paris-Dauphine. Je suis convaincu que pour « [imaginer] la finance de demain » -
pour reprendre le thème de ces journées- il faut en comprendre toutes les facettes, et 
notamment pouvoir déchiffrer l’environnement dans lequel elle évolue. Au travers de ses trois 
grandes missions, la Banque de France joue un rôle majeur, puisqu’elle met en œuvre la 
stratégie monétaire d’abord, en étant partie prenante de l’Eurosystème avec la Banque 
Centrale Européenne à Francfort ; elle assure ensuite la stabilité financière, en surveillant les 
banques, les assurances et, plus généralement, le système financier ; et elle fournit, enfin, un 
service économique aux ménages et aux PME/TPE.  
 
Je voudrais m’arrêter aujourd’hui sur la politique monétaire que nous menons dans le cadre de 
l’Eurosystème. La politique monétaire a longtemps passé pour un sujet technique voire austère. 
Mais on en parle bien davantage depuis 2008 : les banques centrales dans les différents pays ont 
joué un grand rôle, et un rôle largement salué comme positif, dans la sortie de crise. Aujourd’hui, 
cependant, il y a un débat sur leur action face au maintien de l’inflation à niveau très bas. Je 
voudrais donc d’abord parler de notre objectif, ensuite de nos instruments et de leur efficacité. 
 
*** 
 
I. D’abord, la question des objectifs. 
 
Cette question en recouvre en fait deux, qui ont suscité beaucoup de réflexions et discussions. Le 
monde des banquiers centraux se met en question en effet, avec plus de modestie qu’on ne le 
croit souvent :  
1) Quel est l’objectif, le « mandat », de la banque centrale ? 
2) Quels sont, par rapport à cet objectif, les défis actuels ? 
 
1) Commençons par le mandat. 
a) Aux États-Unis, la Federal Reserve a deux objectifs : la stabilité des prix et le plein emploi. En 
zone euro, de par le Traité de Maastricht – approuvé démocratiquement dans chaque pays, dont 
le nôtre par référendum en septembre 1992 – les objectifs sont clairement hiérarchisés : 
l’Eurosystème est dédié à la stabilité des prix, qui est son objectif principal et prioritaire ; 
le soutien à un niveau d’emploi élevé et à une croissance durable est subordonné à la réalisation 
de l’objectif de stabilité des prix. Cette différence a souvent provoqué des débats ; à l’expérience, 
il ne me semble pas qu’elle ait une telle importance. Quand elle combat une inflation trop basse, 
2 
 
la BCE a aussi pour effet de soutenir l’activité. Et parmi les indicateurs que nous regardons, 
l’ « output gap » - l’écart au niveau d’équilibre potentiel de l’économie, encore négatif en France 
et en zone euro - est un élément important.  
 
b) Notre objectif principal de maintien de la stabilité des prix se décline de façon concrète : nous 
visons à atteindre un taux d’inflation inférieur à, mais proche de 2 %, à moyen terme. Cet 
objectif de 2 % à moyen terme est celui de la plupart des banques centrales des économies 
avancées, y compris aux États-Unis et au Japon. Il est celui de la BCE depuis 2003, sur 
proposition de son chef économiste d’alors, l’Allemand Otmar Issing. Il peut sembler paradoxal 
que la stabilité des prix ne soit pas à zéro, mais il y a de bonnes raisons pour cela. Tout d’abord, 
l’ « effet Boskin », du nom de la commission américaine qui a montré en 1996 que les indices de 
prix utilisés pour mesurer l’inflation avaient tendance à la surévaluer, en sous-estimant la 
substitution vers des circuits moins chers, et l’innovation produits. L’objectif d’inflation ne peut 
donc pas être trop rigoureux car il faut garder une marge de sécurité qui permette d’éviter à 
l’économie de basculer en situation de déflation en cas de chocs négatifs. Ensuite, une faible 
inflation facilite les ajustements structurels dans une économie où existent des rigidités 
nominales à la baisse de certains prix, en particulier des salaires.  
 
c) Dans la zone euro cependant, comme dans la plupart des économies avancées, l’inflation 
reste trop basse, malgré des taux d’intérêt historiquement bas : l’indice des prix à la 
consommation harmonisé (IPCH) est en effet repassé en territoire négatif, à -0,2 % en février 
2016, et l’inflation sous-jacente, c’est-à-dire hors énergie et alimentation, n’est que de 0,7 %.  
Est-ce à dire que l’Eurosystème est condamné à ne plus pouvoir remplir son mandat de stabilité 
des prix, ou à changer son objectif ? Je ne le crois pas. Les défis actuels ne remettent pas en cause 
notre mandat, mais ils changent la façon dont nous le remplissons. La continuité de l’objectif est 
essentielle à la crédibilité des politiques monétaires : cette cible de 2 % est un « ancrage » à 
moyen terme, alors qu’il y a tant de volatilité et de court-termisme qui pèsent sur l’économie.  
 
2) Quels sont, par rapport à cet objectif, les défis auxquels les banques centrales sont 
confrontées ?  
Aujourd’hui, l’Eurosystème est confronté à deux défis principaux : les pressions 
désinflationnistes d’une part, et le risque de désancrage des anticipations d’autre part.  
 
a) D’abord, un certain nombre de facteurs contribuent aujourd’hui à une inflation faible. 
En premier lieu, la zone euro fait face à des pressions désinflationnistes liées à une série de 
chocs conjoncturels : en premier lieu, la baisse du prix du pétrole, qui est passé de plus de 80 € 
le baril mi-2014 à 34 € début mars, soit près de 2,5 fois moins, ainsi que celle des matières 
premières ; mais aussi, le ralentissement de la croissance dans les économies émergentes, en 
particulier en Chine ; et enfin, l’insuffisance de la croissance dans la zone euro avec la 
persistance d’un fort taux de chômage, qui bride la hausse des salaires et affaiblit la demande et 
la croissance des prix. En outre, des évolutions structurelles, comme le vieillissement de la 
population, sont susceptibles d’exercer une pression à la baisse sur le taux d’intérêt dit 
« naturel », pour reprendre la terminologie proposée il y a un peu plus d’un siècle par 
l’économiste suédois Knut Wicksell. On peut le définir comme le taux d’intérêt compatible avec 
le plein emploi des facteurs de production. Dans ce cas, pour rétablir le bon équilibre entre 
épargne et investissement, il faut que les taux de marché baissent également.  
En temps normal, la banque centrale intervient par le biais de la baisse des taux directeurs, qui 
se répercute sur la courbe des taux. Cependant, pour faire face à la crise financière, la BCE 
comme les autres banques centrales ont réduit leurs taux d’intérêt directeurs à des niveaux très 
faibles, autour de zéro. Cela signifie que nos instruments habituels de politique monétaire 
doivent être complétés par d’autres instruments, dits non conventionnels, afin d’atteindre notre 
objectif de stabilité des prix. J’y reviendrai. 
 
b) Le deuxième défi, conséquence du premier, est le risque d’un désancrage des 
anticipations, qui rendrait plus difficile le retour à notre cible de 2 %. En effet si l’inflation 
3 
 
restait trop faible trop longtemps, les agents économiques risquent de revoir à la baisse leurs 
anticipations d’inflation, ce qui créerait des effets de second tour. Une inflation anticipée plus 
faible se répercute sur les décisions de fixation des prix et des salaires des agents économiques, 
ce qui à son tour nourrit la faible inflation. Elle peut même créer le risque de la déflation, que 
l’on définit comme un processus cumulatif de diminution des prix, y compris ceux des actifs, 
voire des salaires et de la production, comme l’a connu l’économie mondiale dans les années 
1930 ou partiellement le Japon dans les années 1990. Nous ne sommes pas dans une telle 
situation de déflation aujourd’hui, mais c’est pourquoi notre mandat de maintien de la stabilité 
des prix est symétrique. Nous considérons qu’une inflation trop faible est aussi coûteuse qu’une 
inflation trop élevée. Et en ce sens, il y a plus de risques pour la banque centrale à agir trop tard 
que trop tôt. Depuis le début de l’année, nous constatons que les anticipations d’inflation issues 
des indicateurs de marché sont en baisse. Néanmoins, les dernières prévisions fournies par la 
BCE jeudi dernier continuent d’afficher une hausse graduelle de l’inflation dans les années à 
venir : 0,1 % en 2016, 1,3 % en 2017 et 1,6 % en 2018.  
 
*** 
 
II. J’en viens à mon second point : quelle est l’efficacité des instruments non 
conventionnels que nous mettons en œuvre ?  
 
1) Nous avons, depuis l’été 2014, mis en œuvre un ensemble de mesures de politique 
monétaire, dites non conventionnelles, pour compléter la baisse des taux 
d’intérêt directeurs, aujourd’hui fixés à 0,00 % pour le taux des opérations principales de 
refinancement et -0,40 % pour le taux de la facilité de dépôt. Elles comprennent :  
- des opérations de refinancement des banques à plus long terme, conditionnées à l’octroi de 
crédits à l’économie réelle. La nouvelle série que nous avons décidé de lancer le 10 mars dernier, 
appelée TLTRO 2, permet aux banques d’emprunter à des taux très favorables en fonction du 
montant des crédits consentis ;  
- des achats de titres du secteur privé et du secteur public, pour assouplir encore les conditions 
monétaires et financières en zone euro. L’Eurosystème achète des titres adossés à des actifs, des 
obligations sécurisées ainsi que des obligations de bonne qualité émises par les gouvernements, 
les agences et les institutions de la zone euro. Nous avons décidé le 10 mars d’augmenter encore 
ce programme, en incluant des obligations d’entreprises et en portant le montant des achats 
mensuels à 80 milliards d’euros au lieu de 60 précédemment ; 
- et des indications sur la trajectoire future des taux d’intérêt directeurs – il s’agit de la « forward 
guidance » - afin d’orienter les anticipations des agents. Le 10 mars, nous avons donné les 
indications suivantes : « les taux d’intérêt directeurs de la BCE resteront à leurs niveaux actuels 
ou à des niveaux plus bas sur une période prolongée, et bien au-delà de l’horizon fixé pour nos 
achats nets d’actifs », soit bien au-delà de mars 2017.  
 
Quelques mots d’actualité sur le paquet global décidé, qui donne deux messages très clairs : 
a) Nos décisions sont guidées par notre mandat : ramener l'inflation vers la cible de 2 % à 
moyen terme. Notre détermination est forte, et notre panoplie d'instruments est large. Au-
delà des taux négatifs qui ont naturellement leurs limites, nous agissons sur le crédit 
bancaire -via le ""credit easing"" du nouveau TLTRO- comme sur les financements de marché -
via le programme d'achats du QE élargi-, et nous garantissons de le faire dans la durée 
nécessaire -via la forward guidance. 
b) Notre priorité est le financement de l'économie réelle. L'objectif du TLTRO 2 n'est pas, 
contrairement à certains commentaires, de compenser l'effet des taux négatifs sur les 
banques. Il est d'inciter favorablement les banques à prêter aux entreprises et PME comme 
aux ménages ; de même l'élargissement du programme d'achats aux obligations 
d'entreprises bénéficiera largement aux grandes entreprises françaises. Autrement dit, nous 
sécurisons le financement des entreprises et des ménages, nous le protégeons contre des 
tensions qui seraient liées à la volatilité des marchés.  
 
4 
 
2) Ces mesures non conventionnelles ont été efficaces. Elles se sont traduites par un 
assouplissement substantiel des conditions de financement des entreprises en zone euro. Depuis 
juin 2014, le coût du crédit aux entreprises a baissé de 80 points de base. En l’absence de 
mesures non conventionnelles, nous estimons qu’il nous aurait fallu baisser les taux directeurs 
classiques d’environ 100 points de base en juin 2014 pour obtenir un effet similaire sur les taux 
des banques. Cela a également contribué à relancer le financement de l’économie réelle : 
l’encours des crédits aux entreprises est passé dans la zone euro d’un recul de -2,5 % en juin 
2014 à une croissance de +0,6 % en janvier 2016. L’effet est plus marqué encore pour la France, 
qui enregistre un rythme de croissance annuel des crédits aux entreprises de 4,8 % à la même 
date, le plus élevé de la zone euro, avec en outre les taux de crédit les plus bas. Les estimations 
convergentes de la BCE et de l’Eurosystème montrent ainsi que les mesures mises en œuvre 
depuis juin 2014 devraient engendrer une hausse d’environ 1 % de l’inflation sur la période 
2015-2017 et d’un niveau voisin sur la croissance, toutes choses égales par ailleurs. En France, 
en 2015, cela a contribué à accroître la croissance de 0,3 %, l’INSEE ayant même une estimation 
un peu supérieure (0,4 %). Cela représente un effet conjoncturel d’au moins +80 000 emplois, 
même si seules des réformes structurelles sont de nature à augmenter à long terme la croissance 
et les emplois d’un pays. Pour conclure cette estimation de l’efficacité, le FMI –qui est un « juge 
de paix » reconnu de la pertinence des politiques économiques- l’a dit très clairement à 
l’occasion du G20 de Shanghai fin février : « Le programme d’achats d’actifs de la BCE a soutenu 
la reprise en améliorant la confiance et les conditions financières, et la politique monétaire doit 
rester accommodante ». 
 
3) Qu’en est-il des risques ? J’ai parlé tout à l’heure des risques de l’inaction : nous nous devons 
d’agir, pour ramener l’inflation vers 2 %. Cela étant, nous restons attentifs symétriquement aux 
éventuels « effets secondaires » de notre politique monétaire, notamment en matière de 
stabilité financière. Nous surveillons activement le cycle financier, y compris en France au sein 
du Haut conseil de stabilité financière créé en 2013 : je participe demain à sa 8ème réunion 
auprès du Ministre des Finances. Aujourd’hui, il n’y a pas de signes de formation de « bulles » sur 
les principaux marchés de financement : dans l’ensemble, les développements sur les marchés 
d’actions correspondent aux anticipations de profitabilité des entreprises, et l’évolution des taux 
d’intérêt obligataires paraît cohérente avec les perspectives de croissance et d’inflation. Il n’y a 
pas non plus de signes d’une croissance excessive du crédit dans le système financier. Mais nous 
restons vigilants sur tous les aspects de l’environnement macroéconomique et financier actuel. 
Nous avons par exemple signalé dans notre dernier communiqué du HCSF de décembre 2015, à 
propos du marché immobilier, que « l’ajustement des prix côté résidentiel intervenu depuis 
2012 paraît adapté, tandis que les prix de l’immobilier commercial restent à un niveau élevé ». 
Nous sommes prêts, si nécessaire, à agir par des mesures macroprudentielles, afin de prévenir et 
limiter les risques systémiques qui pourraient se matérialiser.   
 
*** 
 
La politique monétaire fait donc beaucoup pour combattre la faible inflation et soutenir 
conjoncturellement l’activité – c’est notre devoir et nous continuerons à le faire avec une totale 
détermination : nous sommes continus sur l’objectif, mobilisés avec les instruments, vigilants 
sur les risques éventuels. Mais je voudrais pour autant rappeler fortement qu’elle ne peut pas 
tout : « monetary policy cannot be the only game in town ». Les autres politiques économiques 
ont également un rôle à jouer. C’est ce qu’ont souligné à nouveau les pays membres du G20, à 
Shanghai, le 27 février dernier : « les politiques monétaires continueront à soutenir l’activité 
économique et à assurer la stabilité des prix, en cohérence avec le mandat des banques 
centrales, mais la politique monétaire seule ne peut pas entraîner une croissance équilibrée ». 
De ce point de vue, les politiques budgétaires doivent pouvoir soutenir la demande lorsqu’elles 
ont des marges de manœuvre pour le faire – ce n’est pas le cas en France, c’est le cas dans 
d’autres pays européens. Par ailleurs, des réformes structurelles restent indispensables en 
France pour permettre à l’économie de revenir à son plein potentiel en favorisant la création 
d’emplois et d’entreprises. Notre pays n’a pas le temps d’attendre ; ses chômeurs, sa jeunesse 
5 
 
dont vous êtes, n’ont pas le temps d’attendre. Au niveau européen, il faut avancer enfin sur 
l’Union économique, à côté de l’Union monétaire que porte l’Eurosystème. Si nous n’optimisons 
pas la gouvernance de la zone euro, nous n’optimiserons pas sa croissance. La politique 
monétaire très accommodante que nous menons actuellement crée un contexte 
particulièrement favorable pour mener les réformes nécessaires. Elle ne doit pas être une excuse 
pour les reporter : l’Europe et la France doivent impérativement saisir cette chance, maintenant. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Global Interdependence Center - Central Banking Series 
Les anticipations d’inflation, les implications et les réponses de la politique 
monétaire dans un nouveau paradigme des matières premières 
21 mars 2016 
 
Session I : Perspectives des banquiers centraux 
 
Le rôle de la politique monétaire  
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau 
 
 
Depuis la crise financière, les banques centrales sont testées à plusieurs 
niveaux : leur capacité à garder actifs les canaux de transmission de la politique 
monétaire, leur capacité à assurer la stabilité des prix, leur capacité à soutenir 
l’économie. Dans de nombreuses juridictions, les banques centrales ont fait 
beaucoup pour atteindre leurs objectifs. Et leur rôle dans la sortie de crise a été 
largement salué comme positif. Mais dans un contexte où l’inflation reste 
inférieure à sa cible, où les marchés des matières premières sont orientés à la 
baisse de façon persistante et où la dynamique de la croissance s’essouffle, 
l’action des banques centrales est maintenant remise en question : quelle est 
Page 2 sur 8 
 
 
 
l’efficacité de la politique monétaire et quelle peut être son efficacité à l’avenir ? 
Les banques centrales ne sont-elles pas à court de munitions ? La politique 
monétaire est confrontée à des défis, c’est vrai, mais ces difficultés peuvent être 
atténuées. Les banques centrales ont prouvé qu’elles étaient prêtes à jouer leur 
rôle. Ma conviction cependant, c’est qu’elles ne peuvent pas tout : « central 
banks cannot remain the only game in town ». Mes remarques d’aujourd’hui 
porteront sur le cas de la zone euro. Jeffrey [Lacker, président de la Banque 
fédérale de réserve de Richmond] vous donnera certainement davantage 
d’informations sur la situation aux États-Unis. Je m’attacherai d’abord aux défis 
auxquels nous sommes confrontés en tant que banquiers centraux, avant 
d’aborder nos instruments et leur efficacité.  
 
I. Tout d’abord, les défis.  
 
a) Comme vous le savez tous, l’objectif principal de l’Eurosystème est de 
maintenir la stabilité des prix, c’est-à-dire un taux d’inflation inférieur à, mais 
proche de 2 % à moyen terme. Dans la zone euro cependant, comme dans la 
plupart des économies avancées, l’inflation reste trop basse, malgré des taux 
d’intérêt historiquement bas : l’indice des prix à la consommation harmonisé 
(IPCH) est en effet repassé en territoire négatif, à - 0,2 % en février 2016, et 
l’inflation sous-jacente, c'est-à-dire hors énergie et produits alimentaires, n’est 
que de 0,7 %. Un certain nombre de facteurs contribuent aujourd’hui à une 
inflation faible. Tout d’abord, la zone euro fait face à des pressions 
désinflationnistes liées à une série de chocs économiques : premièrement, la 
baisse des prix du pétrole, ainsi que celle des matières premières ; 
deuxièmement, le ralentissement de la croissance dans les économies 
émergentes, en particulier en Chine ; et enfin, l’insuffisance de la croissance 
dans la zone euro avec la persistance d’un fort taux de chômage, qui bride la 
hausse des salaires et affaiblit la demande et la croissance des prix. En outre, 
Page 3 sur 8 
 
 
 
des évolutions structurelles, comme le vieillissement de la population, sont 
également susceptibles d’exercer une pression à la baisse sur le taux d’intérêt dit 
« naturel » ou « Wicksellien ». On peut le définir comme le taux d’intérêt 
compatible avec le plein emploi des facteurs de production. Dans ce cas, pour 
rétablir le bon équilibre entre épargne et investissement, il faut que les taux de 
marché baissent également. En temps normal, les banques centrales 
interviennent par le biais de la baisse des taux directeurs, qui se répercute sur la 
courbe des taux. Cependant, pour faire face à la crise financière, la BCE comme 
les autres banques centrales ont réduit leurs taux d’intérêt directeurs à des 
niveaux très faibles, autour de zéro. Cela signifie que nos instruments habituels 
de politique monétaire doivent être complétés par d’autres instruments, dits non 
conventionnels, afin d’atteindre notre objectif de stabilité des prix. J’y reviendrai. 
 
b) En ce qui concerne les défis auxquels nous sommes actuellement confrontés, 
ces pressions désinflationnistes créent en outre le risque d'un désancrage des 
anticipations, qui rendrait plus difficile le retour à notre cible de 2 %. En effet, si 
l’inflation reste trop faible trop longtemps, les agents économiques risquent de 
revoir à la baisse leurs anticipations d’inflation, ce qui créerait des effets de 
second tour. Une inflation anticipée plus faible se répercute sur les décisions de 
fixation des prix et des salaires des agents économiques, ce qui à son tour nourrit 
la faible inflation. Elle peut même créer le risque de la déflation, que l’on définit 
comme un processus cumulatif de diminution des prix, y compris ceux des actifs, 
voire des salaires et de la production, comme l’a connu l’économie mondiale 
dans les années 1930 ou partiellement le Japon dans les années 1990. Nous ne 
sommes pas dans une telle situation de déflation aujourd’hui. Mais ce risque est 
la raison pour laquelle notre objectif d’inflation est symétrique. Nous considérons 
qu’une inflation trop faible est aussi coûteuse qu’une inflation trop élevée. Et il y a 
donc plus de risques pour la banque centrale à agir trop tard que trop tôt. Depuis 
le début de l’année, nous constatons que les anticipations d’inflation issues des 
Page 4 sur 8 
 
 
 
indicateurs de marché sont en baisse. Néanmoins, les dernières prévisions 
fournies par la BCE continuent d’afficher une hausse graduelle de l’inflation dans 
les années à venir : 0,1 % en 2016, 1,3 % en 2017 et 1,6 % en 2018.  
 
c) Pour certains, ces défis signifient que l’Eurosystème ne peut plus remplir sa 
mission de maintien de la stabilité des prix. Je ne le pense pas. Les défis 
actuels ne remettent pas en cause notre mandat, mais ils changent la façon 
dont nous le remplissons. Certains affirment que l’Eurosystème devrait plutôt 
changer son objectif. Je ne le pense pas non plus. La continuité de l’objectif est 
essentielle pour la crédibilité de la politique monétaire : cette cible de 2 % est un 
« ancrage » à moyen terme, alors qu’il y a tant de volatilité et de court-termisme 
qui pèsent sur l’économie. La plupart des banques centrales des économies 
avancées partagent cet objectif de 2 % à moyen terme, y compris les États-Unis 
et le Japon. C’est l’objectif de la BCE depuis 2003, sur proposition de son chef 
économiste d’alors, l’Allemand Otmar Issing.  
 
II. J’en viens à mon second point : quelle est l’efficacité de notre politique 
monétaire ?  
 
a) Nous avons, depuis l’été 2014, mis en œuvre un ensemble de mesures de 
politique monétaire non conventionnelles, pour compléter la baisse des taux 
d’intérêt directeurs. Ces mesures non conventionnelles ont produit des 
résultats tangibles. Elles se sont traduites par un assouplissement substantiel 
des conditions de financement des entreprises en zone euro. Depuis juin 2014, le 
coût du crédit aux entreprises a baissé de 80 points de base. En l’absence de 
mesures non conventionnelles, nous estimons qu’il nous aurait fallu baisser les 
taux directeurs classiques d’environ 100 points de base en juin 2014 pour obtenir 
un effet similaire sur les taux des banques. Cela a également contribué à 
relancer le financement de l’économie réelle : l’encours des crédits aux 
Page 5 sur 8 
 
 
 
entreprises est passé dans la zone euro d’un recul de - 2,5 % en juin 2014 à une 
croissance de + 0,6 % en janvier 2016. L’effet est plus marqué encore pour la 
France, qui enregistre un rythme de croissance annuel des crédits aux 
entreprises de 4,8 % en janvier 2016, le plus élevé de la zone euro, avec en 
outre les taux de crédit les plus bas. Les estimations convergentes de la BCE et 
de l’Eurosystème montrent ainsi que les mesures mises en œuvre depuis juin 
2014 devraient engendrer une hausse d’environ 1 % de l’inflation sur la 
période  2015-2017 et d’un niveau voisin sur la croissance, toutes choses égales 
par ailleurs. En France, en 2015, cela a contribué à accroître la croissance de 
0,3 %, l’INSEE ayant même une estimation un peu supérieure (0,4 %). Cela 
représente un effet conjoncturel d’au moins + 80 000 emplois, même si seules 
des réformes structurelles sont de nature à augmenter à long terme la croissance 
et les emplois d’un pays. Pour conclure cette estimation de l’efficacité, le FMI - 
qui est un « juge de paix » reconnu de la pertinence des politiques économiques 
- l’a dit très clairement à l’occasion du G20 de Shanghai fin février : « Le 
programme d’achats d’actifs de la BCE a soutenu la reprise en améliorant la 
confiance et les conditions financières, et la politique monétaire doit rester 
accommodante ». 
 
b) Pourquoi avons-nous décidé de faire plus le 10 mars ? L’ensemble complet de 
mesures introduit par la BCE donne deux messages clairs : 
Tout d’abord, nos décisions sont guidées par notre mandat : ramener l’inflation 
vers la cible de 2 % à moyen terme. Notre détermination est forte, et notre 
panoplie d’instruments est large. Outre les taux d’intérêt, nous agissons aussi 
sur l’assouplissement du crédit bancaire avec la nouvelle série d’opérations de 
refinancement à plus long terme ciblées (TLTRO II) et sur le financement de 
marché via le programme d’achats d’actifs du QE élargi, qui est porté à 
80 milliards d’euros par mois et est étendu aux obligations d’entreprises. En 
Page 6 sur 8 
 
 
 
outre, nous garantissons de le faire aussi longtemps que nécessaire - via la 
forward guidance. Ainsi, les taux d’intérêt négatifs ne sont qu’un élément d’un 
ensemble beaucoup plus complet. Nous pensons qu’ils ont été efficaces, mais ils 
ont naturellement leurs limites. De plus, le Conseil des gouverneurs a donné un 
signal fort de sa volonté d’avoir une attitude de coopération au niveau 
international, dans la mesure où il a décidé de ne pas opter pour un système de 
paliers (tiering system) exemptant les banques de taux négatifs.  
Deuxième message : Notre priorité est de promouvoir le financement de 
l’économie réelle. L’objectif du TLTRO 2 n’est pas, contrairement à ce 
qu’affirment certains commentaires, de compenser l’effet des taux négatifs sur 
les banques. Il est d’inciter favorablement les banques à prêter aux entreprises et 
PME comme aux ménages ; de même, l’élargissement du programme d’achats 
aux obligations d’entreprises bénéficiera largement aux grandes entreprises 
françaises. Autrement dit, nous sécurisons le financement des entreprises et des 
ménages, nous le protégeons contre des tensions qui seraient liées à la volatilité 
des marchés.  
c) À présent, qu’en est-il des risques ? J’ai parlé tout à l’heure des risques de 
l’inaction : nous nous devons d’agir, pour ramener l’inflation vers 2 %. Cela étant, 
nous restons attentifs symétriquement aux éventuels « effets secondaires » de 
notre politique monétaire, notamment en matière de stabilité financière. Nous 
surveillons activement le cycle financier, y compris en France au sein du Haut 
conseil de stabilité financière créé en 2013. J’ai participé la semaine dernière à 
sa 8
ème
 réunion auprès du Ministre des Finances. Aujourd’hui, il n’y a pas de 
signes de formation de « bulles » sur nos principaux marchés de financement : 
dans l’ensemble, les développements sur les marchés d’actions correspondent 
aux anticipations de profitabilité des entreprises, et l’évolution des taux d’intérêt 
obligataires paraît également cohérente avec les perspectives de croissance et 
d’inflation. Il n’y a pas non plus de signes d’une croissance excessive du crédit 
Page 7 sur 8 
 
 
 
dans le système financier. Mais nous restons vigilants sur tous les aspects de 
l’environnement macroéconomique et financier actuel. La semaine dernière, le 
Haut conseil de stabilité financière a alerté sur les risques potentiels associés à 
l’immobilier non résidentiel, notamment : « la forte hausse de la demande des 
investisseurs sur certains segments de marché et un niveau élevé des prix, en 
particulier sur les bureaux en région parisienne ». L’évaluation du HCSF sera 
soumise à une consultation publique dans les prochaines semaines. Nous 
sommes prêts, si nécessaire, à agir par des mesures macroprudentielles, afin de 
prévenir et limiter les risques systémiques qui pourraient se matérialiser.   
*** 
 
En résumé, la politique monétaire fait beaucoup pour combattre la faible inflation 
et soutenir l’activité économique - c’est notre devoir et nous continuerons à le 
faire avec une totale détermination : nous sommes continus sur l’objectif, 
mobilisés avec les instruments, vigilants sur les risques éventuels. Mais je 
voudrais pour autant rappeler fortement que la « politique monétaire ne peut pas 
tout ». Les autres politiques économiques ont également un rôle essentiel à 
jouer. C’est précisément ce qu’ont souligné à nouveau les pays membres du 
G20, à Shanghai, le 27 février dernier : « les politiques monétaires continueront à 
soutenir l’activité économique et à assurer la stabilité des prix, en cohérence 
avec le mandat des banques centrales, mais la politique monétaire seule ne peut 
pas entraîner une croissance équilibrée ». Les politiques budgétaires doivent 
pouvoir soutenir la demande lorsqu’elles ont des marges de manœuvre pour le 
faire – ce n’est pas le cas actuellement en France, mais c’est le cas dans 
d’autres pays européens. Par ailleurs, des réformes structurelles restent 
indispensables en France pour permettre à l’économie de revenir à son plein 
potentiel en favorisant la création d’emplois et d’entreprises. Au niveau européen, 
il faut avancer enfin vers une véritable union économique, à côté de l’union 
Page 8 sur 8 
 
 
 
monétaire que porte l’Eurosystème. Si nous n’optimisons pas la gouvernance de 
la zone euro, nous n’optimiserons pas sa croissance. La politique monétaire très 
accommodante que nous menons actuellement crée un contexte particulièrement 
favorable pour mener les réformes nécessaires. Elle ne doit pas être une excuse 
pour les reporter : l’Europe et la France doivent impérativement saisir cette 
chance, maintenant. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Bruegel - 22 mars 2016 
 
L'EUROPE A LA CROISEE DES CHEMINS :  
COMMENT PARVENIR A UNE GOUVERNANCE ECONOMIQUE EFFICACE DANS LA ZONE EURO ? 
 
FRANÇOIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU, GOUVERNEUR DE LA BANQUE DE FRANCE 
 
 
RÉSUMÉ 
 
Il apparaît de plus en plus nécessaire de repenser la gouvernance économique de la zone 
euro. Des idées convaincantes ont été avancées à cet effet, mais leur mise en œuvre est 
délicate, notamment dans le climat actuel d'euroscepticisme.  
 
Il est urgent de passer de la théorie à la pratique si l'on veut que la politique monétaire cesse 
d'être « la seule partie à jouer » (the only game in town). En clair, la politique monétaire 
unique ne peut se substituer ni à la coordination des politiques économiques nationales ni au 
manque de réformes. Certes, le débat sur la gouvernance de l'UEM est controversé d'un point 
de vue politique ; mais pour les citoyens européens, la coordination insuffisante des politiques 
nationales a un coût élevé en termes de croissance, équivalent à plusieurs points de PIB. 
Nous devons, par conséquent, plaider le dossier économique : l’enjeu ici, ce n’est pas « plus 
de Bruxelles », c’est plus de croissance et d'emplois en Europe. En outre, il ne s'agit pas de 
choisir entre réformes nationales et coordination européenne ; nous avons besoin des deux.  
 
Entre l’intégration complète – du type de celle de la politique monétaire – et la simple 
surveillance des politiques nationales, comme c'est le cas actuellement, le chaînon manquant 
est la « pleine coordination » des politiques budgétaires et structurelles. C'est ce que 
montre clairement une matrice croisant ces trois niveaux d'intégration et les quatre 
composantes de la politique économique (monétaire, financière, budgétaire et structurelle).  
 
Cette pleine coordination des politiques budgétaires et structurelles nationales ne sera possible 
qu’avec la mise en place d'une institution décisionnelle légitime, ayant à sa tête un ministre 
des Finances de la zone euro, dont le rôle est ici concrètement défini. Cela permettra de faire 
de la zone euro plus que la somme de ses composantes.  
 
Dans le cadre d'un mandat visant une croissance plus forte, durable et équilibrée, le rôle de 
cette institution serait de préparer et proposer une stratégie collective pour la zone euro, 
ainsi que de superviser sa mise en œuvre par les États membres. En outre, le ministre des 
Finances serait chargé de la résolution efficace des crises. Dans la suite du processus 
d'intégration, le ministre pourrait se voir confier la gestion d’un fonds de convergence, qui 
évoluerait en trois étapes vers un budget pour la zone euro.  
 
2 
 
En tout état de cause, le ministre devra pouvoir s'appuyer sur une procédure de nomination 
renforçant la légitimité de sa fonction, sur une véritable administration du Trésor et sur un 
contrôle démocratique fort sur les affaires de la zone euro.  
 
Pour faire écho à Robert Mundell, c’est la politique économique prise dans son ensemble qui 
est non seulement la meilleure partie à jouer, mais surtout la seule possible. Nous ne pouvons 
pas nous permettre de manquer une autre occasion : pour l'UEM, pour ses citoyens, 2016-
2017 est le moment décisif pour agir. 
 
Nous tous sommes probablement d’accord sur un point essentiel : la zone euro doit repenser 
sa gouvernance économique, au-delà des importants changements institutionnels mis en 
œuvre durant la crise. Des progrès sont absolument indispensables ; et pour autant ils sont très 
difficiles dans un contexte d'euroscepticisme croissant. Je veux rendre hommage à Helmut 
Schmidt, l’un des grands Européens. Il l’a dit clairement à Francfort en octobre 2011 : « Nous 
n'avons pas réussi à définir les règles du jeu économiques pour l'union monétaire. Aucune 
autorité responsable de la politique budgétaire et économique et dotée de pouvoirs forts, n'a 
été créée. »i 
Je m’exprime dans cet esprit, en tant qu'Européen engagé ayant contribué à l'Union 
Economique et Monétaire depuis ses débuts, et aussi en tant que membre du Conseil des 
gouverneurs de la BCE. Parmi les idées que je vais développer, certaines ont été exposées 
dans l’article que nous avons rédigé avec Jens Weidmann en février, même si mes propos 
d'aujourd'hui ne reflètent pas nécessairement ses opinions ni celles d'autres collègues de la 
BCE, et bien entendu n'engagent pas le gouvernement français.  
Si les idées de renforcement de la gouvernance économique ne sont pas toutes nouvelles, leur 
mise en œuvre est délicate : ce sera l'objet principal de mon intervention. Il est urgent de 
passer de la théorie à la mise en pratique si l'on veut que la politique monétaire cesse d'être 
« la seule partie à jouer » (the only game in town). C'est pour cette raison notamment que les 
banquiers centraux sont légitimes à contribuer au débat, même si c'est aux dirigeants 
politiques que revient la décision d’agir.  
Cette question a déjà inspiré un grand nombre d'excellentes contributions : dès 2011, par 
exemple, Jean-Claude Trichetii plaidait en faveur d'un ministre européen des Finances ; 
début 2015, Mario Draghiiii appelait de ses vœux un « saut quantique» en matière 
d'intégration européenne et de convergence institutionnelle. En novembre dernier, Ignazio 
Viscoiv souhaitait que des progrès parallèles et décisifs soient réalisés en matière d'union 
politique. Je ne peux citer tous les contributeurs, mais Bruegel a également plaidé en faveur 
d'une capacité budgétaire européenne et d’une plus forte coordination des politiques 
économiques, de même que Jean Pisani-Ferry et nombre d’autresv. 
L'année dernière, le rapport des cinq présidents, suivi du paquet législatif pour l'UEM de la 
Commission européenne, reflétait un point de vue plus consensuel sur la manière 
d'approfondir et de renforcer l'UEM dans quatre domaines : financier, budgétaire, économique 
et politique - et à deux horizons différents : le court terme et le long terme, avec pour ce 
dernier une possible révision du Traité.  
La réforme de la gouvernance économique de la zone euro fait l'objet d'un débat controversé 
mais indispensable, qui nécessite d’adopter des positions de principe (I). Parmi celles-ci, 
j’insisterai ensuite sur la priorité à accorder à la « pleine coordination » des politiques 
économiques nationales, et partant sur le besoin d’un ministre des Finances fort pour la zone 
euro dont je détaillerai le rôle (II).  
3 
 
I. LE DEBAT CONTROVERSE QUE NOUS DEVONS MENER, AINSI QUE QUELQUES POSITIONS DE 
PRINCIPE FONDAMENTALES.  
A. Le débat est controversé selon au moins trois lignes de partage 
Premièrement, s'agissant de la relation entre la zone euro et le reste de l'UE, le 
renforcement de l'intégration sur ces deux périmètres en même temps, voire au même rythme, 
n’est pas garanti. Cela laisse entrevoir la perspective d'une Europe à plusieurs vitesses, en 
particulier à un moment où l'appartenance à l'UE pourrait devenir un processus réversible. Il 
ne faut pas avoir peur de plusieurs rythmes. Plus clairement, quelles que soient les limites de 
l'« accord de Bruxelles » de février, je suis fortement en faveur du maintien du Royaume-Uni 
dans l'UE ; cela dit, indépendamment du résultat du référendum britannique, la zone euro peut 
et doit avancer sur la voie de l'intégration. 
Deuxièmement, les tensions et l’hétérogénéité au sein de la zone euro, notamment entre les 
pays dits du centre et ceux de la périphérie, ont été accentuées par la crise, de sorte qu'un 
partage des risques pourrait être perçu comme impliquant des transferts permanents entre les 
économies. Une mutualisation des risques serait alors considérée comme source d'aléa moral, 
avec la suspicion permanente de comportements de « passagers clandestins ». Pour autant, 
l'hétérogénéité entre les différents pays nécessite une coopération renforcée, fondée sur la 
réduction et le partage des risques. La résolution des tensions entre solidarité et responsabilité 
est l’unique moyen d’aller de l’avant. 
Enfin, sur la question primordiale de la gouvernance économique de la zone euro, la France 
et l'Allemagne n'ont pas toujours été d’accord. En Allemagne, la notion de « gouvernement 
économique », telle que proposée par Pierre Bérégovoy au début des années quatre-vingt-dix 
a été considérée à l'origine comme une menace pour l'indépendance de la BCE. Elle est vue 
aujourd'hui comme un nouveau moyen  d’éviter la mise en œuvre de réformes nationales. 
Pour être juste, tant l’appel français à une plus grande implication de l’Allemagne dans la 
coordination, que les doutes de l'Allemagne au sujet des réformes françaises étaient et 
demeurent fondés. Un pis-aller serait que rien ne se passe avant les élections françaises et 
allemandes de  2017. Mais même dans cette éventualité, 2016 peut et doit être une année de 
préparation intense.  
B. Pourquoi ce débat demeure une nécessité et quels sont les arguments économiques 
que nous devons faire valoir 
Nous sommes conscients des fortes résistances politiques au partage des ressources 
budgétaires et de la souveraineté, ainsi que de l'euroscepticisme et de l'absence 
d'appropriation nationale des questions européennes. Le triste exemple de la crise des réfugiés 
illustre le peu de solidarité dont les pays européens ont fait preuve jusqu'à présent pour 
aboutir à une solution commune. En termes d’économie politique, cela peut être perçu comme 
une tension entre préférences nationales et intérêt commun. C'est pourquoi nous devons 
faire valoir des arguments économiques. Pour promouvoir une gouvernance de la zone euro 
plus solide, on ne peut se cantonner à des arguments purement institutionnels, mus par une 
croyance  aveugle en une intégration toujours plus étroite. Il ne s'agit pas d'une question 
théologique, ni d'une question uniquement politique. Il s'agit d'un outil très concret pour 
permettre à la zone euro de développer tout son potentiel économique. Si nous devons faire 
tout notre possible pour parvenir à un tel accord, c’est pour le bien-être des citoyens 
européens. Il faut s'appuyer sur une analyse économique objective ainsi que sur des données 
empiriques. L’enjeu ici, ce n'est pas « plus de Bruxelles », c’est plus de croissance et 
d'emplois en Europe. 
En clair, la politique monétaire ne peut se substituer ni à la coordination des politiques 
économiques ni au manque de réformes. La BCE accomplit les plus grands efforts pour 
4 
 
remplir son mandat. Cependant, surcharger la politique monétaire comporte des risques 
économiques, et même politiques : des risques pour la stabilité financière, pour le bon 
fonctionnement des canaux du crédit, et pour l'indépendance de la banque centrale, telle 
qu'inscrite dans les traités. Ne serait-ce que pour cette raison, les banquiers centraux doivent 
prendre part au débat.  
La façon dont nous avons géré la crise a montré à quel point nous manquions de préparation 
et de coordination. Cet épisode a non seulement nui à notre crédibilité, mais il a également 
révélé le coût économique du manque de coordination en termes de prévention et de gestion 
des crises, tant à l'échelle nationale que sur le plan collectif.  
À l'échelle nationale, les États membres n'ont pas eu la capacité d’absorber des chocs 
importants dans le cadre de l'UEM. Le caractère non contraignant de la coordination des 
politiques économiques, telle que définie dans la stratégie de Lisbonne ou Europe 2020, en est 
en partie responsable. Certains États membres se sont également montrés peu enclins à mettre 
en œuvre les réformes structurelles et budgétaires nationales nécessaires pour accorder une 
plus grande marge de manœuvre à la politique économique face aux chocs. Sur le plan 
collectif, la dynamique censée résulter de la pression des pairs et de la discipline de marché 
n'a pas fonctionné, les marchés n'accordant aucune crédibilité au principe de non-
renflouement (no bail-out), et les autorités nationales n'acceptant réellement ni la pression des 
pairs ni le respect des règles.  
L'absence de coordination a un vrai coût économique. Plusieurs études ont estimé ce coût 
pour la zone euro. Il recouvre le coût des crises et des programmes d'aide, et l'impact sur la 
croissance du respect inégal des règles budgétaires avant la crise ainsi que la rigidité des 
règles durant la crise.  
Je veux ici citer quelques chiffres. Les crises bancaires et budgétaires peuvent être 
extrêmement coûteuses : par rapport à la trajectoire de croissance aux États-Unis, la zone euro 
accuse un retard de 5 % en termes de PIB par habitant depuis 2011. La Commission 
européennevi et le NIESRvii ont tous deux montré la forte incidence d'un resserrement 
budgétaire simultané en Europe, soit une baisse du PIB supplémentaire de 2 % environ en 
raison des externalités intra-zone euro. Une coordination optimale des politiques économiques 
de la zone euro aurait nécessité des efforts de redressement différenciés, conformes à la marge 
de manœuvre budgétaire disponible, avec in fine de meilleures performances en termes de 
croissance. Le dernier exemple a trait à l'ajustement asymétrique résultant des déséquilibres 
de comptes courants constatés au niveau national en début de crise, et qui contribuent 
aujourd'hui à l'important excédent extérieur de la zone euro. Pour une zone économique dont 
l'écart de production demeure négatif de plus de 2%, un excédent de plus de 3 % du PIB est 
clairement sous-optimal. 
En résumé, tous ces chiffres témoignent du coût significatif d'une absence de coordination, 
soit au moins 2 % du PIB de la zone euro actuellement. 
C. Pour faire avancer le débat, il faut opérer trois choix fondamentaux. 
Ces choix sont nécessaires pour : (1) dépasser le débat entre coordination et réformes ; (2) 
simplifier les règles et ancrer les politiques économiques dans une institution ; afin  (3) 
d’aboutir à une pleine coordination.  
Premièrement, nous n'avons pas à choisir entre la coordination des politiques 
économiques et les réformes nationales. Il s'agit là de la pierre angulaire de tout accord 
franco-allemand : dépasser le blocage politique lié à l'opposition entre coordination ou 
réformes, et progresser en parallèle sur les réformes nationales et la coordination européenne. 
5 
 
Cela nécessite de surmonter la méfiance et de placer ces deux aspects sous les auspices d’une 
institution commune.  
Deuxièmement, les « institutions avec mandat » sont plus efficaces que les « règles sans 
institutions ». Pour renforcer la cohérence et la coordination des politiques économiques, il 
faut reconnaître que nous avons besoin de règles plus simples. Par exemple, la complexité des 
réformes du Pacte de stabilité et de croissance (PSC) et du « pacte budgétaire » est telle que 
certains ministres des Finances admettent, en privé, qu'ils ne savent pas si leur pays respecte 
complètement les règles. Mais l’expérience nous apprend que l'on ne peut se contenter de 
s’appuyer simplement sur des règles. Elles doivent être complétées d'institutions dotées de 
pouvoirs discrétionnaires. Mario Draghi a souligné la différence fondamentale entre une 
institution de politique monétaire et des règles budgétaires, ce qu’illustrent les résultats 
respectifs de la BCE et du PSC.  
Troisièmement, il y a place pour un niveau intermédiaire d'intégration, que j'appellerai « 
pleine coordination des politiques économiques nationales ». C’est le chaînon actuellement 
manquant entre intégration complète, du type de celle de la politique monétaire, et la 
surveillance à partir de règles, comme c'est actuellement le cas des politiques budgétaires 
nationales. Ceci peut être illustré par une matrice (cf. ci-après) qui croise les 4 composantes 
de la politique économique (monétaire, financière, budgétaire et structurelle), en colonnes, et 
les 3 niveaux d'intégration, en lignes, c'est-à-dire : le niveau le moins élevé de politiques 
nationales sous surveillance  (avec recommandations), le niveau intermédiaire des politiques 
nationales pleinement coordonnées (avec incitations) et le niveau supérieur de la « politique 
intégrée » (avec instruments communs). Les quatre composantes de la politique économique 
présentées ici sont relativement distinctes, mais elles contribuent toutes à atteindre le même 
objectif : stimuler la croissance tout en atténuant les chocs. Leur classement de gauche à 
droite, correspond plus ou moins à leurs effets de stabilisation ou d’allocation (en d'autres 
termes, à leurs effets conjoncturels ou structurels).  
Je ne m’étendrai pas davantage sur la politique monétaire. Comme complément à l'union 
monétaire, l'union économique peut être vue comme la combinaison de trois grands 
instruments de politique économique : (1) financier, (2) budgétaire et (3) structurel. De fait, 
ces trois dimensions exercent un effet d'offre puissant sur l'allocation des ressources (croissant 
à mesure que l'on se déplace vers la droite de la matrice). 
Je ne m’attarderai pas beaucoup plus sur la dimension financière de l’UEM. L'Union 
bancaire, lorsqu'elle sera achevée, pourra évoluer vers le niveau le plus élevé d'intégration 
institutionnelle. De même, le plan Juncker est un instrument intégré utile, mais trop faible et 
trop lent à l'heure actuelle. J'ai déjà souligné ailleurs la nécessité et les avantages à s’orienter 
vers d'une « Union de financement et d'investissement » beaucoup plus forte, incorporant ces 
avancées et allant bien au-delà de l'Union des marchés de capitaux qui a été proposée.  
Je préfère aujourd'hui mettre l'accent sur les dimensions budgétaires et structurelles des 
politiques économiques. En pratique, notre cadre budgétaire a été mis en œuvre comme un 
dispositif de surveillance assez faible. De même, au plan structurel, il est évident que la PDM 
(Procédure concernant les déséquilibres macroéconomiques) est insuffisante. Il manque 
clairement une institution permettant de développer et d’imposer une pleine coordination des 
politiques nationales dans les domaines budgétaires et structurels, idée que je détaillerai dans 
quelques instants.

Légende : BCE : Banque centrale européenne ; MSU : Mécanisme de supervision unique ; MRU : Mécanisme de résolution 
unique ; PSC : Pacte de stabilité et de croissance ; PDM : Procédure concernant les déséquilibres macroéconomiques ; 
UMC : Union des marchés de capitaux  
La nature éminemment politique du débat ne doit pas masquer la forte rationalité économique 
d'une telle réforme. Il y a 15 ans, Peter Kenenviii défendait l'idée qu'une intégration 
budgétaire permettrait aux zones monétaires de prospérer, même si elles ne présentaient pas 
toutes les caractéristiques d'une zone monétaire optimale. Le niveau le plus élevé d'intégration 
de politique économique impliquerait en toute logique de construire une véritable union 
budgétaire et de compléter le Marché unique : mais cela nécessiterait sûrement une 
convergence plus importante ex ante et la résolution de certains héritages du passé. À mon 
sens, nous devrions ouvrir la porte à un renforcement de l'intégration pour les pays qui sont 
volontaires et prêts pour ce faire. J'y reviendrai, mais d'abord, je souhaiterais mettre l'accent 
sur ce que je considère comme le volet le plus urgent de la réforme de l'UEM,  à savoir… 
 
II. COMMENT METTRE EN PLACE UNE INSTITUTION FORTE AFIN DE COORDONNER 
PLEINEMENT LES POLITIQUES BUDGETAIRES ET STRUCTURELLES NATIONALES  
Une telle institution rendrait possible la réalisation du deuxième niveau d'intégration, c'est-à-
dire la pleine coordination des politiques nationales. En termes économiques, elle 
contribuerait à internaliser les externalités négatives (liées à la moindre demande externe ou 
aux effets de contagion financière) résultant de chocs économiques asymétriques dans 
différents pays, ainsi qu'à optimiser les externalités positives entre les politiques budgétaires 
et structurelles. En termes politiques, elle permettrait de faire de la zone euro plus que la 
somme de ses composantes. Pour reprendre une phrase célèbre de Jean Monnet, « rien ne se 
crée sans les hommes, mais rien ne dure sans les institutions ». Je suis convaincu que la 
mise en place d’une institution forte dirigée par un ministre des Finances de la zone euro 
consoliderait l'intégration de la politique économique. 
Je souhaite décrire d’abord le mandat et la stratégie commune ; ensuite le rôle concret d'un 
ministre des Finances de la zone euro ; enfin, la façon d’asseoir sa légitimité et ses moyens. 
A. Quel mandat et quelle stratégie ? 
La Commission a déjà mis en place un Semestre européen en deux étapes, afin que les débats 
relatifs aux perspectives globales de la zone euro précèdent l'analyse par pays. Il faut aller 
7 
 
plus loin : le mandat de cette institution ayant pouvoir de décision doit être d’atteindre 
l’objectif d'une croissance plus forte, durable et équilibrée. Afin de remplir ce mandat, cette 
institution, en particulier le ministre des Finances à sa tête, aura pour mission de définir la 
stratégie collective. Il sera essentiel que la zone euro, sur la base des informations fournies 
par des Conseils indépendants, s'accorde collectivement sur les objectifs globaux de politique 
économique et sur le partage des tâches, via la définition d'objectifs de performance 
individuels pour les États membres. Un tel accord pourrait être atteint par un processus 
suivant plus ou moins le calendrier du Semestre européen : 
<U+F0B7> Une phase de préparation fournirait le cadre macroéconomique prenant en compte les 
contributions des différents pays, ainsi que l'expertise du Conseil budgétaire et du Conseil 
de compétitivité. Cette phase exigerait d'évaluer : premièrement, la croissance potentielle, 
avec un objectif d'accélération quantifié ; deuxièmement, l'écart de production et l'emploi 
dans la zone euro, en tenant compte de la mobilité transfrontière limitée du facteur travail ; 
troisièmement, la situation budgétaire et la position extérieure soutenables pour la zone 
euro dans son ensemble, ainsi que leur bonne répartition entre les différents pays. Il existe 
des similarités avec l'objectif visé par le G20 dans son« cadre pour la croissance » 
(Framework for growth), processus par lequel les différents pays identifient des objectifs 
partagés, les politiques économiques nécessaires pour les atteindre et les progrès effectués 
dans cette voie... même si nous pouvons et devons manifestement faire preuve de plus 
d'ambition pour la zone euro. 
<U+F0B7> Dans la phase de décision, le ministre des Finances de la zone euro proposerait une 
stratégie, qui consisterait en un objectif commun et, autant que nécessaire, sa déclinaison 
pour chaque pays en termes de réformes et d'orientation de la politique économique. Cette 
proposition ferait l'objet d’avis formel du Conseil budgétaire et du Conseil de 
compétitivité. Elle devrait ensuite être adoptée à la majorité simple par l'Eurogroupe puis 
approuvée par le Parlement européen. En cas de blocage, ce serait aux chefs d'État ou de 
gouvernement (le Conseil européen en format zone euro) d'adopter la stratégie collective, 
sur la base d'une proposition adaptée émanant toujours du ministre des Finances de la zone 
euro. 
Nous devons bien sûr garder à l'esprit le principe de subsidiarité. Les résultats de la zone 
euro resteront conditionnés par les politiques économiques nationales. De nombreux 
domaines d'élaboration de la politique économique et la totalité de sa mise en œuvre 
demeureront décentralisés. Toutefois, la pleine coordination nécessitera que l'orientation et les 
externalités de la politique économique fassent l'objet d'un accord collectif et que les États 
membres travaillent de façon cohérente pour atteindre les objectifs communs. 
B. Quel rôle pour un ministre des Finances de la zone euro ? 
Premièrement, le ministre serait chargé de la préparation d’une stratégie collective à 
l’échelle de la zone euro pour remplir le mandat décrit précédemment. 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la surveillance de la mise en 
œuvre des politiques ainsi définies et de la discipline institutionnelle, en utilisant les 
instruments appropriés pour créer des incitations symétriques. Les incitations négatives 
comprendraient naturellement l’application effective des mécanismes de sanction existants. 
Elles pourraient être élargies aux procédures contractuelles déjà proposées dans le cadre de la 
contribution franco-allemande de 2013 sur l’UEM, ou dans la proposition de la Chancelière 
allemandeix de « contrats de réforme contraignants », et devraient inclure aussi des incitations 
positives. L’une d’entre elles serait l’accès à un « fonds de convergence de la zone euro », 
grâce auquel les États membres bénéficieraient d’un financement commun, après avoir fait 
leurs preuves et évité de manière convaincante l’aléa moral. De plus, conditionner la 
8 
 
participation à la gouvernance économique à la mise en œuvre conforme des objectifs 
nationaux serait une incitation forte. 
Troisièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la mise en œuvre de la gestion 
de crise centralisée. Les caractéristiques spécifiques du MES (Mécanisme Européen de 
Stabilité) éclairent certaines limites inhérentes à la zone euro, les États membres ayant décidé 
que la solidarité ne ferait pas partie du système de gouvernance habituel. Par conséquent, les 
bases du MES reposent sur un traité intergouvernemental. Le ministre des Finances de la zone 
euro serait naturellement chargé du contrôle des opérations du MES. Les méthodes de gestion 
de crise pourraient certainement mieux intégrer la soutenabilité de la dette, le soutien en 
matière de liquidité et la stabilité financière, corrigeant ainsi plusieurs faiblesses récemment 
soulignées par le FMI.  
Enfin, au fur et à mesure de l’intégration, le ministre pourrait se voir confier la gestion du 
fonds de convergence de la zone euro, évoluant vers un budget de l’euro. Nous abordons 
ici la question d’une capacité budgétaire commune, avancée récemment par Pier Carlo Padoan 
ou Benoît Coeuré. Il me semble qu’il est raisonnable de la construire en trois étapes, selon une 
méthode qui a bien réussi dans le passé. Dans un premier temps, les États membres seraient 
libres d’y participer, et le fonds de convergence serait consacré au financement de projets 
communs comme les investissements dans les infrastructures européennes ou l’installation 
des réfugiés. Dans un deuxième temps qui constituerait une avancée importante, ce budget 
pourrait devenir un instrument de stabilisation, centralisant un ensemble bien défini 
d’instruments d’intervention, comme par exemple un niveau européen d’assurance-chômage. 
La dernière étape de l’intégration budgétaire ne serait réalisée que si un accord était trouvé à 
la fois sur le financement (capacité directe à lever des impôts et émission de dette commune) 
et sur le niveau souhaitable de synchronisation des cycles économiques. L’accès à ce 
troisième stade étant associé à des risques réduits, cette perspective constituerait une incitation 
puissante à une discipline et à un engagement nationaux, comme lors de la préparation du 
passage à l’euro. 
C. Comment mettre en place une institution légitime dotée d’une véritable capacité 
administrative ? 
L’intégration plus large et la responsabilité démocratique doivent progresser en parallèle, 
comme le souligne mon article récent avec Jens Weidmann. Nous devons permettre à 
l’administration économique européenne d’être plus efficace, tout en lui assurant une 
légitimité politique suffisamment forte pour garantir un équilibre entre responsabilité et 
contrôle. Un Trésor européen dirigé par un ministre des Finances de la zone euro serait 
susceptible de concrétiser cet équilibre délicat. Ces modifications institutionnelles nécessitent 
de toute évidence un nouveau Traité, même si nous pouvons concrétiser dès cette année 
certains progrès déjà à notre portée. 
Premièrement, nous avons besoin d’une procédure de nomination de nature à établir 
fortement la légitimité de la fonction. Le ministre des Finances pourrait ainsi être nommé pour 
une période de cinq ans par le Conseil européen à la majorité qualifiée, sur proposition du 
président de la Commission européenne. Cette nomination serait soumise à l’approbation 
formelle du Parlement européen, et le ministre des Finances serait membre de la Commission 
et président de l’Eurogroupe. Le ministre aurait ainsi la légitimité nécessaire pour représenter 
la zone euro dans les forums économiques et financiers internationaux, aux côtés du président 
de la BCE. 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances de la zone euro devrait pouvoir s’appuyer sur un 
véritable Trésor européen, qui pourrait intégrer des experts de la Direction générale des 
affaires économiques et financières de la Commission, du MES, et du secrétariat du Comité 
économique et financier. Cette administration bénéficierait également de l’expertise publique 
9 
 
de deux organismes indépendants, le Conseil budgétaire européen et le Conseil de 
compétitivité.  
Enfin, si nous parvenons à mettre en œuvre une intégration plus poussée, nous aurons besoin 
d’un contrôle démocratique plus fort sur les affaires de la zone euro. À cette fin, nous 
devrons envisager d’institutionnaliser un format « zone euro » au sein du Parlement européen. 
Les relations entre les députés de la zone euro et les parlements nationaux devront également 
être renforcées, par le biais d’un accord interinstitutionnel ou par la création de commissions 
dédiées. 
*

Pour conclure, je récapitule brièvement :  
(i) Le manque de coordination économique a un coût élevé pour les citoyens de la 
zone euro, à hauteur de plusieurs points de PIB  
(ii) Entre une intégration complète – du type de celle de la politique monétaire – 
et une simple surveillance des politiques économiques nationales – comme 
c’est le cas actuellement –, le chaînon manquant est celui d’une pleine 
coordination des politiques budgétaires et structurelles 
(iii) Cette pleine coordination ne peut être obtenue qu’en mettant en place une 
institution décisionnelle légitime, incarnée par un ministre des Finances de la 
zone euro, chargé d’élaborer la « stratégie économique collective ». 
Robert Mundell, fondateur de la théorie des zones monétaires optimales, a reconnu que la 
zone euro était loin d’être optimale. Il est toutefois resté confiant,  en déclarant : « [ce projet] 
sera réalisé car pour l’Europe, ce n’est pas seulement la meilleure partie à jouer, c’est la 
seule. » (it isn't just the best game in town, it's the only game) Une politique économique 
d’ensemble, et non la seule action des banques centrales, est effectivement l’unique partie à 
jouer. Bien sûr, il existe toujours un risque d’échec lorsque l’on mène des réformes 
ambitieuses. Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre une énième occasion manquée, 
et il nous faut agir vite, sans perdre de vue les perspectives à long terme. Pour la zone euro, 
pour ses citoyens, 2016-17 est le moment décisif pour agir.

Forum des marchés émergents - Paris, 11 avril 2016 
 
Le défi d'une gouvernance économique efficace à l'échelle européenne  
pour contribuer à une communauté internationale prospère 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Chers amis, Mesdames et Messieurs,  
 
Plaçons-nous dans une perspective à long terme. Ce forum, réuni grâce à Michel Camdessus et à 
Harinder Kohli, constitue une rare occasion d’évoquer la physionomie de l’économie mondiale et de sa 
gouvernance à l’horizon de deux générations. Dans un instant, nous débattrons des grandes tendances 
mondiales et des différents scénarios envisageables. En présence d’un si grand nombre de participants 
éminents venus des économies de marché émergentes, et de spécialistes du système monétaire 
international, je souhaiterais m'exprimer aujourd'hui en tant qu'Européen. Il me semble qu’adopter une 
perspective européenne est tout à fait légitime dans ce forum et ce, pour au moins trois raisons : 
<U+F0B7> L'une des grandes tendances de l’économie mondiale est probablement celle de l'intégration 
régionale : la manière dont elle va influer sur le fragile équilibre entre souveraineté et coopération 
internationale est une question à laquelle l'Union Européenne réfléchit depuis sa création. 
<U+F0B7> Un grand nombre de défis auxquels nous devons faire face à l'échelle mondiale et en termes 
de coordination se sont présentés au cours du processus d'intégration européenne, et sont 
toujours au cœur du débat : les effets de bord et les externalités économiques, la stabilité monétaire 
et l'efficacité de la gouvernance. 
<U+F0B7> Une Europe forte particulièrement nécessaire dans un monde multipolaire, pour le rôle 
d’équilibrage qu’elle peut y jouer. En 2050, le clivage ne sera plus entre économies émergentes et 
économies avancées, mais entre celles qui étaient préparées et celles qui ne l'étaient pas. 
Les idées pour un renforcement de la gouvernance économique européenne ne sont pas nouvelles. En 
revanche, la mobilisation de ces idées et leur mise en œuvre se sont révélées délicates : ce sera l'objet 
principal de mes remarques qui porteront, dans un premier temps, sur les motivations (I) et ensuite sur 
le rôle concret d'un ministre des Finances de la zone euro (II).

I - POURQUOI NOUS AVONS BESOIN D'UNE INSTITUTION CHARGÉE DE LA « PLEINE COORDINATION » DANS LA ZONE 
EURO 
 
Nous sommes conscients des fortes résistances politiques au partage des ressources budgétaires 
et de la souveraineté, ainsi que de l'euroscepticisme. Le triste exemple de la crise des réfugiés illustre 
le peu de solidarité dont les pays européens ont fait preuve jusqu'à présent pour aboutir à une solution 
commune. C'est pourquoi nous devons faire valoir des arguments économiques pour promouvoir 
une gouvernance de la zone euro plus solide : il ne s'agit pas d'une question théologique, ni d'une 
question uniquement politique. L’enjeu ici, ce n'est pas « plus de Bruxelles », c’est très concrètement 
plus de croissance et d'emplois en Europe. À l’évidence, la politique monétaire ne peut se substituer 
ni à la coordination des politiques économiques ni au manque de réformes. Ne serait-ce que pour 
cette raison, les banquiers centraux doivent prendre part au débat, même si c'est aux dirigeants 
politiques que revient la décision d’agir. C'est aussi pourquoi nous devons mettre l'accent sur la 
question de la gouvernance économique de la zone euro. Il ne faut pas avoir peur d’une Europe à 
plusieurs rythmes. Je suis profondément favorable au maintien du Royaume-Uni dans l'UE ; cela dit, 
indépendamment du résultat du référendum britannique, la zone euro peut et doit avancer sur la voie 
de l'intégration.  
La crise de la zone euro a montré à quel point nous manquions de préparation. La dynamique censée 
résulter de la pression des pairs et de la discipline de marché n'a pas fonctionné, les marchés 
n'accordant aucune crédibilité au principe de non-renflouement (no bail-out), et les autorités nationales 
n'acceptant réellement ni la pression des pairs ni le respect des règles. 
L'absence de coordination a un vrai coût économique. Il recouvre le coût des crises et des 
programmes d'aide, et l'impact sur la croissance du respect inégal des règles budgétaires avant la crise 
ainsi que de la rigidité des règles durant la crise. Plusieurs études font état d’un coût significatif de 
l'absence de coordination, de l'ordre de 2 à 5 % du PIB depuis la crise. 
Pour faire avancer le débat, il faut opérer trois choix fondamentaux : Premièrement, progresser en 
parallèle sur les réformes nationales et la coordination européenne. Il s'agit là de la pierre angulaire de 
tout accord franco-allemand : pour être juste, tant l’appel français à une plus grande implication de 
l’Allemagne dans la coordination, que les doutes de l'Allemagne au sujet des réformes françaises étaient 
et demeurent fondés. Cela nécessite de surmonter la méfiance réciproque et de placer ces deux aspects 
sous les auspices d’une institution commune. 
Deuxièmement, nous devons reconnaître que les « institutions avec mandat » sont plus efficaces que 
les « règles sans institutions ». Pour renforcer la cohérence et la coordination des politiques 
économiques, il faut reconnaître que nous avons besoin de règles plus simples. Mais elles doivent être 
complétées par des institutions fortes dotées de pouvoirs discrétionnaires. Mario Draghi a souligné

différence fondamentale entre une institution de politique monétaire et des règles budgétaires, ce 
qu'illustrent les résultats respectifs de la BCE et du PSC. 
Troisièmement, il y a place pour un niveau intermédiaire d'intégration, illustré par une matrice simple.  
 
Matrice de la gouvernance économique européenne 
 
 
 
Légende : BCE : Banque centrale européenne ; MSU : Mécanisme de supervision unique ; MRU : Mécanisme 
de résolution unique ; PSC : Pacte de stabilité et de croissance ; PDM : Procédure concernant les 
déséquilibres macroéconomiques ; UMC : Union des marchés de capitaux  
 
Je l'appellerai « pleine coordination des politiques économiques nationales », le chaînon 
actuellement manquant entre intégration complète, du type de celle de la politique monétaire, et la 
surveillance fondée sur des règles, comme c'est actuellement le cas des politiques budgétaires 
nationales en Europe, et dont l’efficacité est clairement insuffisante. 
Il est certain que le niveau le plus élevé d'intégration de politique économique impliquerait en toute 
logique de construire une véritable union budgétaire et d’achever la réalisation du Marché unique, mais 
cela nécessiterait sûrement une convergence plus importante ex ante et la résolution de certains 
héritages du passé. À mon sens, nous devrions ouvrir la porte à un renforcement de l'intégration pour 
les pays qui sont volontaires et prêts pour ce faire. Néanmoins, le volet le plus urgent de la réforme de 
l'UEM concerne la mise en place d’une institution forte dirigée par un ministre des Finances de la 
zone euro afin de coordonner pleinement les politiques budgétaires et structurelles nationales. 
En termes économiques, elle contribuerait à internaliser les externalités négatives (liées à la moindre 
demande externe ou aux effets de contagion financière) résultant de chocs économiques asymétriques 
dans différents pays, ainsi qu'à optimiser les externalités positives entre les politiques budgétaires et 
structurelles. En termes politiques, elle permettrait de faire de la zone euro plus que la somme de ses 
parties. Pour reprendre une phrase célèbre de Jean Monnet, « rien ne se crée sans les hommes, mais

rien ne dure sans les institutions ». Le mandat de cette institution ayant pouvoir de décision doit être 
d’atteindre l’objectif d'une croissance plus forte, durable et équilibrée.  
 
II - COMMENT DEVONS-NOUS CONCRÈTEMENT DÉFINIR LES MISSIONS D'UN MINISTRE DES FINANCES DE LA ZONE 
EURO. 
J'en vois quatre. Premièrement, le ministre serait chargé de la préparation d'une stratégie collective 
à l'échelle de la zone euro pour remplir le mandat décrit précédemment. Il sera essentiel que la 
zone euro s'accorde collectivement sur les objectifs globaux de politique économique et sur le partage 
des tâches, via la définition d'objectifs de performances individuels pour les États membres. Un tel 
accord pourrait être obtenu par un processus en deux étapes : 
<U+F0B7> Une phase de préparation qui impliquerait d'évaluer : (1) la croissance potentielle, avec un objectif 
d'accélération quantifié ; (2) l'écart de production de la zone euro ; (3) la situation budgétaire et la 
position extérieure soutenables pour la zone euro dans son ensemble, ainsi que leur bonne 
répartition entre les différents pays. 
<U+F0B7> Une phase de décision, dans laquelle le ministre des Finances de la zone euro proposerait une 
stratégie qui consisterait en un objectif commun et, autant que nécessaire, sa déclinaison pour 
chaque pays en termes de réformes et d'orientation de la politique économique, en gardant bien sûr 
à l'esprit le principe de subsidiarité. Cette proposition ferait l'objet d’avis formels du Conseil 
budgétaire et du Conseil de compétitivité et devrait ensuite être adoptée à la majorité simple par 
l'Eurogroupe puis approuvée par le Parlement européen. 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la surveillance de la mise en œuvre de 
la stratégie collective, en utilisant les instruments appropriés pour créer des incitations symétriques. 
Les incitations négatives comprendraient naturellement l’application effective des mécanismes de 
sanction existants. Elles pourraient être élargies aux procédures contractuelles déjà proposées dans le 
cadre de la contribution franco-allemande de 2013 sur l’UEM, ou dans la proposition de la Chancelière 
allemande
2
 de « contrats de réforme contraignants », et devraient aussi inclure des incitations positives. 
L’une d’entre elles serait l’accès à un « fonds de convergence de la zone euro », grâce auquel les États 
membres bénéficieraient d’un financement commun. De plus, conditionner la participation à la 
gouvernance économique à la mise en œuvre conforme des objectifs nationaux serait une incitation 
forte. 
Troisièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la mise en œuvre de la gestion de crise 
centralisée. Le ministre des Finances de la zone euro serait naturellement chargé du contrôle des 
opérations du Mécanisme européen de stabilité. 
Enfin, au fur et à mesure de l'intégration, le ministre pourrait se voir confier la gestion du fonds de 
convergence de la zone euro, évoluant vers un budget de l’euro. Nous abordons ici la question d’une

capacité budgétaire commune, avancée récemment par Pier Carlo Padoan
3
. Elle pourrait être construite 
en trois étapes, selon une méthode qui a bien réussi dans le passé. Dans un premier temps, les États 
membres seraient libres d'y participer, et le fonds de convergence serait consacré au financement de 
projets communs comme les investissements dans les infrastructures européennes ou l’installation des 
réfugiés. Dans un deuxième temps, ce budget pourrait devenir un instrument de stabilisation, 
centralisant un ensemble bien défini d’instruments d’intervention, comme par exemple un niveau 
européen d’assurance-chômage. La troisième et dernière étape de l’intégration budgétaire ne serait 
réalisée que si un accord était trouvé à la fois sur le financement (capacité directe à lever des impôts et 
émission de dette commune) et sur le niveau souhaitable de synchronisation des cycles économiques. 
Cette perspective constituerait une incitation puissante à une discipline et à un engagement nationaux, 
comme lors de la préparation du passage à l’euro. 
Comment mettre en place une institution légitime dotée d’une véritable capacité 
administrative ?  
L’intégration plus large et la responsabilité démocratique doivent progresser en parallèle, comme le 
souligne mon article récent avec Jens Weidmann. Nous devons permettre à l’administration économique 
européenne d’être plus efficace, tout en lui assurant une légitimité politique suffisamment forte pour 
garantir un équilibre entre responsabilité et contrôle. Ces modifications institutionnelles nécessitent de 
toute évidence un nouveau Traité. 
Premièrement, nous avons besoin d’une procédure de nomination de nature à établir fortement la 
légitimité de la fonction. Le ministre des Finances pourrait ainsi être nommé pour une période de cinq 
ans par le Conseil européen à la majorité qualifiée, sur proposition du président de la Commission 
européenne. Cette nouvelle nomination serait soumise à l’approbation formelle du Parlement européen, 
et le ministre des Finances serait membre de la Commission et président de l’Eurogroupe. Le ministre 
aurait ainsi la légitimité nécessaire pour représenter la zone euro dans les forums économiques et 
financiers internationaux, aux côtés du président de la BCE. 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances de la zone euro devrait pouvoir s’appuyer sur un véritable 
Trésor européen, qui pourrait intégrer des experts de la Direction générale des affaires économiques et 
financières de la Commission, du MES, et du secrétariat du Comité économique et financier. Cette 
administration bénéficierait également de l'expertise publique de deux organismes indépendants, le 
Conseil budgétaire européen et le Conseil de Compétitivité. 
Enfin, si nous parvenons à mettre en œuvre une intégration plus poussée, nous aurons besoin d’un 
contrôle démocratique plus fort sur les affaires de la zone euro. À cette fin, nous devrons envisager 
d’institutionnaliser un format « zone euro » au sein du Parlement européen. Les relations entre les 
députés de la zone euro et les parlements nationaux devront également être renforcées, par le biais d’un 
accord interinstitutionnel ou par la création de commissions dédiées.

New York – 18 avril 2016 
 
DISCOURS EUROPLACE  
 
FRANÇOIS VILLEROY DE GALHAU, GOUVERNEUR DE LA BANQUE DE FRANCE 
 
 
• En 2016, le monde en général, et l'Europe en particulier, connaît une 
période d'incertitudes : incertitudes liées à notre sécurité, avec la menace 
terroriste ; incertitudes politiques, avec le risque d'un « Brexit » et la crise 
des réfugiés ; et incertitudes économiques, avec le ralentissement de la 
croissance dans les économies émergentes, y compris la Chine, et une 
forte volatilité du marché en début d'année. Néanmoins, la reprise est en 
marche en Europe. 
• Comme vous le savez probablement, une réunion du Conseil des 
gouverneurs de la BCE va avoir lieu dans deux jours, je dois donc 
respecter la période de réserve sur les questions de politique monétaire. 
En revanche, je peux souligner le fait que, en réponse à une faible inflation 
et à un regain d'incertitude, l'Eurosystème, dont la Banque de France est 
membre, a pris des mesures décisives, et les pays européens ont mis en 
œuvre des réformes structurelles depuis le début de la crise. 
• Ces efforts nationaux sont primordiaux, mais il nous faut aller plus loin et 
garantir une plus grande coordination : coordination afin de canaliser 
l'épargne vers les projets et les pays qui en ont besoin ; coordination des 
réformes elles-mêmes au niveau européen. 
 
1/L'évolution des conditions économiques 
 
• [Diapositive 2] La croissance économique en Europe s'est nettement 
redressée en 2015 et devrait encore se renforcer en 2016 et en 2017, 
notamment grâce au dynamisme des économies allemande et espagnole 
et, dans une moindre mesure, de la France et de l'Italie. 
• La situation sur le marché du travail s'améliore et le chômage recule. Dans 
la zone euro, le taux de chômage est à son plus bas niveau depuis quatre 
ans, même s’il est encore trop élevé. 
• En France, la croissance reste modérée. Elle a atteint 1,2 % en 2015, 
après 0,2 % en 2014, et devrait demeurer au moins à ce niveau en 2016 et 
en 2017. Cela dit, l'indicateur du climat des affaires1 s'est amélioré tout au 
long de l'année, atteignant en janvier 2016 son niveau le plus élevé en 
quatre ans. 
 
2/Les évolutions de l'inflation 
 
• [Diapositive 3] En 2015, l'inflation a été proche de zéro dans la zone euro, 
c'est-à-dire bien en deçà de l'objectif de l'Eurosystème, soit un taux 
d'inflation inférieur à, mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme. L'inflation est 
même entrée temporairement en territoire négatif, les prix enregistrant une 
baisse de 0,1 % en glissement annuel en mars. Toutefois, ce recul est 
essentiellement lié aux prix de l'énergie, l'inflation sous-jacente ressortant 
à 1 % le même mois. Les prix du pétrole semblent avoir atteint un point 
bas, ce qui devrait permettre un retour de l'inflation en territoire positif 
courant 2016, et donc une baisse des taux d'intérêt réels et une plus 
grande efficacité de la politique monétaire. 
• [Diapositive 4] La nouvelle série de mesures adoptées le 10 mars 2016 a 
accentué l'orientation accommodante de la politique monétaire de la zone 
euro. Ces mesures ont notamment la particularité d'être axées sur le 
                                                          
1 INSEE: Indicateur de climat des affaires et de retournement conjoncturel 
financement de l'économie réelle. La nouvelle série d'opérations de 
refinancement ciblées (dites TLTRO 2) devrait améliorer les conditions de 
financement à moyen terme pour les banques et encourager les prêts 
bancaires aux entreprises et aux ménages. 
 
3/ Les politiques structurelles  
 
• En outre, la politique monétaire n'est pas la seule carte à jouer. Elle est 
soutenue par des réformes structurelles destinées à renforcer la 
croissance potentielle, en particulier dans les pays dont le taux de 
chômage est élevé.  
• L'histoire a montré que des réformes ambitieuses pouvaient apporter une 
contribution durable à la croissance. La Suède, dans les années quatre-
vingt-dix, et l'Allemagne, dix ans plus tard, ont toutes deux démontré que 
les réformes structurelles amélioraient les taux d'emploi, la croissance 
potentielle et la résilience de l’économie. Elles atténuent également la 
dualité du marché du travail, et offrent de plus grands débouchés aux 
nouveaux entrants sur le marché du travail, notamment aux jeunes. À la 
suite de graves crises, la Suède et l'Allemagne ont reconstruit leurs 
modèles économiques et ont donc été davantage en mesure de surmonter 
le récent ralentissement de l’activité. 
• Plusieurs pays européens ont engagé des réformes majeures pour 
retrouver une croissance élevée et durable. Ces réformes sont 
particulièrement délicates lorsqu'il s'agit du marché du travail, mais elles 
sont nécessaires. Nous devons accroître la flexibilité du travail et réduire la 
dualité du marché du travail entre contrats permanents et contrats 
temporaires, qui est source à la fois de chômage structurel élevé et 
d'inégalités. 
• Les réformes menées en Espagne en sont l'exemple le plus 
emblématique. Leurs résultats sont particulièrement impressionnants si 
l'on tient compte de la situation économique extrêmement difficile du pays 
lorsqu'elles ont été mises en œuvre. Depuis début 2013, le taux de 
chômage en Espagne a diminué de quelque 6 points de pourcentage, et la 
croissance espagnole est actuellement l'un des principaux moteurs de la 
reprise en Europe. 
• Contrairement aux idées préconçues, la France a également démontré par 
le passé sa capacité à relever le défi des réformes économiques et 
sociales. Dans les années quatre-vingt-dix, afin de préparer l'introduction 
de l'euro, la France a mené une politique de « désinflation compétitive » 
qui s'est révélée hautement efficace. Il convient de rappeler que, à la fin 
des années quatre-vingt-dix, la France connaissait le taux de croissance 
du PIB le plus élevé et le taux d'inflation le plus bas parmi les pays 
européens, et que son taux de chômage enregistrait des baisses 
significatives. 
• Aujourd'hui, les réformes françaises vont dans la bonne direction, 
[Diapositive 5] en particulier le crédit d'impôt pour la compétitivité et 
l'emploi (CICE) et le Pacte de responsabilité et de solidarité, qui renforcent 
la compétitivité de l'économie française. Une politique de simplification 
administrative, appelée « choc de simplification », ainsi qu'une nouvelle loi 
visant à soutenir la croissance économique et l'entrepreneuriat (« loi 
Macron ») sont également mises en œuvre afin de rétablir la confiance des 
entreprises. Mais nous n’avons pas encore terminé et un certain nombre 
de réformes doivent être complétées, en particulier sur le marché du 
travail : de nouveaux progrès seront réalisés, je l'espère, grâce au projet 
de loi en cours d'examen au Parlement. 
• Enfin, dans la zone euro, la politique budgétaire est à présent plus 
équilibrée, un ajustement important ayant d’ores et déjà été réalisé. Des 
efforts structurels et une reprise de la croissance ont entraîné une 
réduction des déficits et une stabilisation du ratio dette/PIB.  
• Ce dosage plus équilibré des politiques macroéconomiques offre 
l’opportunité de tester de nouveaux modes de réflexion et de renforcer la 
reprise par le biais d’une coordination économique plus étroite en Europe. 
La marge de manœuvre des politiques économiques varie selon les pays 
européens, mais chacun d’eux doit utiliser celle dont il dispose pour 
améliorer la situation globale [Diapositive 6]. Les pays européens ont 
chacun consenti beaucoup d’efforts, mais à présent nous pouvons, et nous 
devons, faire plus pour coordonner les politiques axées sur la demande et 
les réformes structurelles au niveau européen. Pour cela, je souhaiterais 
faire deux propositions. 
 
 
4/ Renforcer l’investissement  
 
• Premièrement, nous devons améliorer le financement de l’investissement 
[Diapositive 7]. Nos efforts doivent se concentrer sur le financement de la 
croissance et de l’innovation et sur le dosage approprié entre les solutions 
de financement par endettement et par émissions d’actions, tout en 
continuant de préserver la stabilité financière et d’assurer la protection des 
consommateurs. Dans l’UE, la Commission européenne a lancé plusieurs 
initiatives pour atteindre ces objectifs, notamment le Plan d’investissement 
et l’Union des marchés de capitaux. 
• Deuxièmement, nous devons nous attacher à supprimer les obstacles à 
l’investissement, en apportant de la visibilité et une assistance technique 
aux projets d’investissement et en utilisant plus intelligemment les 
ressources financières nouvelles et existantes. Le Fonds européen pour 
les investissements stratégiques (EFSI) est l’élément moteur du Plan 
d’investissement pour l’Europe. Il soutient les investissements stratégiques 
dans des domaines clés tels que les infrastructures, l’éducation, la 
recherche, l’innovation ainsi que le financement à risque des petites 
entreprises. En s’appuyant sur des garanties publiques limitées, il vise à 
générer des investissements privés pour un montant total de 315 milliards 
d’euros sur trois ans. Pour la première année, le Plan est parvenu à 
mobiliser quelque 76 milliards d’euros d’investissements en Europe. 
• Le plan d’action du projet d’Union des marchés de capitaux, lancé en 
septembre 2015, a pour objectif de diversifier les modes de financement 
de l’économie de l’UE. Le but est de parvenir à un meilleur équilibre entre 
crédit bancaire et financement de marché. La France est précurseur dans 
ce domaine au niveau de la zone euro, les marchés finançant son 
économie à hauteur de 40 %. Diverses initiatives sont déjà en bonne voie, 
comme par exemple le cadre pour des instruments de titrisation simples, 
transparents et comparables ou la révision des exigences de fonds 
propres pour les investissements dans les infrastructures réalisés par les 
sociétés d’assurance.  
• Le Plan Juncker et l’Union pour les marchés de capitaux doivent se 
compléter mutuellement et être complémentaires de l’Union bancaire, déjà 
en place, afin de faire pleinement sentir leurs effets en termes de 
croissance et d’investissement. Par conséquent, je préfère le concept 
d’une « Union pour le financement et l’investissement » à celui d’une 
« Union pour les marchés de capitaux », dans la mesure où cela reflète 
mieux l’objectif final qui est la croissance, grâce à une meilleure 
combinaison des instruments de financement, incluant les marchés de 
capitaux, mais sans s’y limiter. 
• Des volumes d’épargne importants sont disponibles dans la zone euro et 
ceux-ci devraient être dirigés vers des actifs à long terme, ainsi que vers 
les projets et les pays qui en ont besoin. Des dispositifs innovants doivent 
être développés au niveau européen, tels que des fonds de capital-risque 
européens afin de soutenir la création et la croissance de nouvelles 
entreprises. La composition des investissements est également 
importante, dans la mesure où trop peu d’argent est consacré à la R&D et 
aux investissements à long terme. Nous devons également encourager le 
financement par émissions d’actions plutôt que le financement par 
endettement. 
 
 
5/ Améliorer la gouvernance économique en Europe 
 
• La seconde idée que j’aimerais partager avec vous a trait à la 
gouvernance économique en Europe. Je crois que nous devons 
progresser vers une zone euro plus intégrée sur le plan économique. Cela 
est primordial, que le Royaume-Uni demeure ou pas dans l’UE. 
Naturellement, je préfèrerais que ce pays reste membre. Mon point de vue 
n’est pas purement institutionnel. L’enjeu ici, ce n’est pas « plus de 
Bruxelles », c’est plus de croissance et d’emploi. En effet, les économistes 
estiment que le manque de coordination actuel entre les politiques 
économiques nationales a coûté aux Européens entre deux et cinq points 
de pourcentage de PIB depuis 2011. À la différence de la politique 
monétaire, l’objectif n’est pas d’intégrer totalement toutes nos politiques 
économiques au niveau européen mais de parvenir à une « pleine 
coordination » des politiques budgétaires et structurelles. Pour ce faire, 
nous devons avoir des objectifs économiques partagés et une véritable 
« stratégie collective » pour la zone euro, dans laquelle chaque pays à un 
rôle à jouer pour améliorer la situation de tous.  
• Pour cela, il faut de la confiance fondée sur un pacte clair : des réformes 
nationales et, pas ou, une coordination européenne. Cette pleine 
coordination s’appuie également sur la mise en place d’une institution 
européenne forte et légitime : un ministre des Finances de la zone euro 
épaulé par un Trésor européen et soumis à une responsabilité 
démocratique plus grande. Ce ministre des Finances serait chargé de 
définir la stratégie collective, de surveiller sa mise en œuvre décentralisée 
par les États membres et de gérer les outils de gestion de crise. À plus 
long terme, il/elle pourrait également être responsable d’un budget 
commun.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
 gouverneur de la Banque de France, 
 pour l’inauguration du Centre fiduciaire du Nord de la France 
  
Sainghin-en-Mélantois, le 28 avril 2016 
 
Monsieur le Préfet, Monsieur le Député, Monsieur le Président de la Métropole européenne de 
Lille, Monsieur le Maire, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui pour inaugurer le Centre Fiduciaire Nord 
de France, dont la première pierre a été posée le 13 novembre 2014 par Christian Noyer en 
présence de nombre d’entre vous. 
 
L’émission et l’entretien de la monnaie fiduciaire sont historiquement la première des 
missions d’une Banque Centrale. L’environnement de ce métier est en profonde mutation, tant 
du fait de la digitalisation progressive des moyens de paiements que de l’évolution des acteurs 
de la filière fiduciaire. Je le dis tout de suite : nous ne croyons pas à la fin de l’argent liquide 
et l’Eurosystème, dont la Banque de France, n’a aucune volonté de supprimer le cash - Il fait 
partie du libre choix des consommateurs, des Français -. Mais les innovations technologiques 
nous obligent à faire preuve d’agilité en nous adaptant constamment. 
 
En matière fiduciaire, nous avons engagé en 2013 une stratégie visant à la fois à rationaliser le 
nombre de centres forts de la Banque de France  sur le territoire et à les moderniser. Cette 
stratégie comporte la construction de deux centres fiduciaires de nouvelle génération : celui-ci 
et un second, situé à La Courneuve, au nord de Paris, dont je poserai la première pierre 
le 10 juin.  
 
Ce site illustre ainsi concrètement la mise en œuvre de notre stratégie puisqu’à Sainghin-en-
Mélantois sont aujourd’hui regroupées les activités des caisses de Roubaix et d’Arras dans un 
centre fiduciaire aux meilleurs standards internationaux.  
 
Genèse et objectifs du projet 
 
Retournons quelques années en arrière. Si la Banque de France a toujours modernisé le tri du 
billet lui-même, les opérations logistiques de transfert et de stockage des valeurs à l’intérieur 
de nos caisses n’avaient jamais connu de rupture majeure. Une comparaison avec d’autres 
banques centrales (États-Unis, Japon, Singapour, …) démontrait qu’une nouvelle marche 
pouvait être gravie et c’est l’origine de ce projet ambitieux, premier centre fortement 
automatisé de l’Eurosystème à être ouvert. 
 
2 
Trois objectifs ont été fixés au projet : 
<U+F0A7> l’amélioration de la productivité grâce à l’automatisation des process, 
<U+F0A7> la suppression des tâches fastidieuses grâce à la robotisation de plusieurs étapes de la 
chaîne de traitement des valeurs, 
<U+F0A7> une meilleure offre de services à nos clients. 
 
Caractéristiques factuelles du site inauguré aujourd’hui 
 
Cette modernisation repose sur des standards industriels éprouvés, issus du monde de la 
logistique : 
<U+F0A7> le transport et le stockage des valeurs sont assurés par des moyens automatisés : 
convoyeurs de colis, chariots autoguidés pour le transport de palettes, magasin 
automatique de colis et de palettes ;  
<U+F0A7> les manipulations sont fortement limitées par l’utilisation de robots pour toutes les 
opérations de palettisation et dépalettisation. 
 
Une sécurisation accrue est obtenue par le recours à un nouveau concept de défense :  
<U+F0A7> contrôles en amont des flux avec un bâtiment de screening (où les véhicules et les 
transporteurs de fonds font l’objet de vérifications strictes) ; 
<U+F0A7> multiples barrières défensives ; 
<U+F0A7> résistance du bâtiment modélisée pour résister à une attaque de forte intensité ; 
<U+F0A7> vidéosurveillance intégrale du site et détection de toutes les menaces par des dispositifs 
de pointe. 
 
Le bâtiment d’une surface de près de 6 000 m² sur 2 niveaux, dont l’un enterré, est une 
réussite puisqu’il a su concrétiser le respect des impératifs de sûreté – qui nécessitent de le 
renfermer sur lui-même –  avec une attention forte portée au bien-être au travail. Au cours de 
la visite, vous observerez notamment le patio paysagé permettant un éclairage naturel des 
espaces de travail. 
 
Demain une quarantaine d’agents travailleront sur ce nouveau site qui traitera environ 
300 millions de billets par an.  
 
Réussite du projet dans le budget et le planning 
 
Il a fallu un peu plus de deux ans d’études pour concevoir le site, et un peu moins de 
deux ans  pour le construire, soit une réalisation conforme au planning initial : 
<U+F0A7> avril 2012 : validation du programme 
<U+F0A7> avril 2013 : choix de l’esquisse  
<U+F0A7> juin 2014 : début des travaux  
<U+F0A7> février 2016 : réception du site par la Banque 
 
Au total, le budget de 40 millions d’euros d’investissement a été respecté pour la livraison de 
ce site avec son très haut niveau de robustesse.  
  
 
3 
 
Remerciements : 
 
Aux autorités : 
<U+F0A7> tout d’abord au préfet du Nord et au maire de Sainghin-en-Mélantois pour l’instruction 
rapide des procédures administratives ; 
<U+F0A7> aux forces de l’ordre : le directeur départemental de la Sécurité publique et le directeur 
de cabinet du préfet pour leur concours apporté à la mise en protection de ce site 
sensible. 
 
Aux équipes de la Banque de France : 
<U+F0A7> à l’équipe projet de la direction des Grands Projets fiduciaires, notamment le directeur 
de projet, Thierry Para, qui a animé une équipe soudée autour de ce projet ambitieux et 
exigeant ;  
<U+F0A7> à la direction de l’Immobilier et des Services généraux, en charge de la maîtrise 
d’ouvrage immobilière, et à la direction de la Sécurité, contributeurs majeurs qui ont 
œuvré quotidiennement pour la réussite du projet ;  
<U+F0A7> également : 
<U+F0B7> à la direction des Achats pour sa contribution à l’ingénierie contractuelle ; 
<U+F0B7> aux directions de l’OI car il s’est agi de mettre en place un système 
d’information industriel performant ; 
<U+F0B7> aux équipes des sites de Roubaix et d’Arras, particulièrement mobilisées autour 
de la direction régionale pour la validation de la conception et la mise en 
exploitation, mais j’y reviendrai. 
 
À la MOE et aux entreprises : 
<U+F0A7> à Assystem qui a assuré la maîtrise d’œuvre et aux architectes d’ATAUB ;  
<U+F0A7> à l’ensemble des entreprises, notamment Eiffage pour la construction et ULMA pour les 
équipements logistiques. 
 
Ouverture sur le change et la mise en exploitation 
 
L’enjeu est aujourd’hui la montée en charge de ce site qui repose sur la mobilisation des 
équipes régionales. Je sais l’importance du changement auquel vous avez à faire face, mais je 
connais aussi votre volonté de réussir à faire vivre ce site, qui symbolise une évolution 
majeure du travail des professionnels que vous êtes. Avec ce bel outil, vous allez être des 
organisateurs, des gestionnaires de process, déchargés de la plupart des manipulations que 
vous effectuez actuellement. 
 
Je comprends les inquiétudes et les impatiences face à de tels changements, et j’ai bien 
conscience des moments compliqués que vous vivez, puisqu’il s’agit de faire démarrer ce site 
tout en effectuant les opérations courantes sur l’actuel centre de Roubaix. Mais nous en 
sommes convaincus ensemble, une mission plus performante est une mission mieux assurée 
pour l’avenir, mieux assurée de son avenir. 
 
Je vous remercie une nouvelle fois pour votre mobilisation.

Le rôle de la banque centrale dans le soutien d’une croissance forte 
et durable à moyen et long terme 
 
OCDE   23 mai 2016 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Introduction : 
Bonsoir Mesdames et Messieurs. C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être ici ce soir. Vous 
connaissez sans doute la plaisanterie : « Combien faut-il d’économistes de banque centrale 
pour visser une ampoule ? » « Un seul : il tient l'ampoule et la terre tourne autour de lui ». En 
traitant du rôle des banques centrales dans le soutien de la croissance, vous pensez peut-
être que j’outrepasse un peu mon rôle de banquier central. Mais comme vous le constaterez, 
mes vues sont plus modestes. 
 
Comme nous le savons tous, la croissance à long terme est déterminée par des forces 
réelles : l’accumulation de capital physique, le développement de nouveaux produits et de 
nouvelles techniques de production, la mise en place d’infrastructures publiques, 
l’investissement dans l’éducation et les compétences et l’allocation efficace des ressources 
entre les différentes utilisations. La croissance à long terme n’est pas déterminée par des 
valeurs nominales et il peut donc sembler étrange de penser que les banques centrales 
jouent un rôle quelconque dans le soutien d’une croissance forte et durable à moyen et à 
long terme. La politique monétaire est généralement perçue comme agissant sur la demande 
et la dimension cyclique de l’activité. 
 
J’aimerais cependant faire remarquer que les banques centrales disposent d’au moins trois 
moyens importants pour augmenter le taux de croissance soutenable.  
 
La première contribution que peuvent apporter les banques centrales est bien connue et 
consiste à assurer la stabilité des prix. Celle-ci permet de restreindre la gamme des 
trajectoires futures du niveau agrégé des prix et donne ainsi certaines garanties quant à la 
2 
 
valeur économique réelle des contrats nominaux. La baisse de la prime de risque d’inflation 
diminue l’incertitude des contrats à long terme, facilitant ainsi l’investissement dans des 
projets à rendements potentiels élevés mais assortis de longues périodes de gestation. 
 
La stabilité des prix aide également les consommateurs et les entreprises à identifier plus 
facilement les variations des prix relatifs. Une vision plus claire de ces prix permet ensuite à 
une économie de déplacer plus rapidement ses ressources vers des utilisations plus 
rentables, d’améliorer sa compétitivité et donc sa productivité agrégée. 
 
Cependant, j’aimerais insister sur deux autres moyens moins connus par lesquels la banque 
centrale peut aider à renforcer le taux de croissance potentielle d’une économie :  
o la politique monétaire peut contribuer à atténuer les effets négatifs à moyen terme 
d’une profonde récession sur la croissance potentielle, notamment à la suite d’une 
crise financière ;  
o la politique monétaire peut favoriser la croissance à long terme en soutenant des 
réformes structurelles, notamment celles qui sont propices à un système financier 
plus résistant et plus efficace.  
 
 
1. La politique monétaire peut contribuer à atténuer les effets négatifs à moyen 
terme d’une profonde récession sur la croissance potentielle. 
1.1 Tout d’abord, la « frontière » entre une politique monétaire contracyclique appropriée et 
une croissance durable à moyen terme est une frontière ouverte. 
 
Une profonde récession, telle que la Grande récession, peut exercer sur la croissance 
potentielle des effets durables, dont la nature est différente des conséquences habituelles 
d’un ralentissement conjoncturel. En raison de sa durée et de son ampleur, elle peut porter 
atteinte au stock de capital humain et physique disponible ainsi qu’à la croissance de la 
productivité à moyen terme. La politique monétaire peut atténuer ces effets par le biais d’une 
orientation accommodante appropriée.  
 
En premier lieu, une récession profonde risque d’entraîner une dépréciation du stock de 
capital humain disponible
1
. Le chômage de longue durée a atteint des sommets historiques 
lors de la Grande récession aux États-Unis, en Espagne, en Italie ou en France. Les

compétences des chômeurs de longue durée peuvent ainsi s’éroder en raison du manque de 
pratique.  
 
Le chômage de longue durée risque également de décourager une partie de la population 
active, qui peut quitter définitivement le marché du travail. Le fléchissement structurel du 
taux d’activité de la population active s’est accéléré avec la crise aux États-Unis. Cette 
évolution ne se constate cependant pas dans tous les pays, comme le montre l’exemple de 
l’Espagne. En effet, le comportement inverse peut être observé : le chômage d’un membre 
d’un ménage peut conduire d’autres membres de ce ménage à entrer sur le marché du 
travail. Ces deux effets peuvent se compenser ou se dominer l’un l’autre, entraînant des 
trajectoires différentes selon les pays. 
 
Enfin, une profonde récession peut entraîner une réallocation sectorielle puisqu’une partie de 
la population active manque des compétences appropriées. Les travailleurs espagnols du 
secteur de la construction ont été confrontés à une forte contraction de la part de ce secteur 
dans l'emploi total (de 13 % à 5 %) et ont dû trouver un emploi dans d’autres secteurs. Le 
recul est moins important mais cependant non négligeable dans les pays ayant connu un 
essor de la construction. Plus généralement, selon une étude de la Banque de France
2
, la 
courbe de Beveridge s’est déplacée dans la zone euro et aux États-Unis : pour un même 
niveau de chômage, les emplois vacants ont augmenté, ce qui indique une hausse du 
chômage structurel. 
 
Ces effets de la crise sur le capital humain s’estomperont seulement de façon progressive, 
avec l’arrivée de nouvelles générations sur le marché du travail. Ils pourraient cependant 
être atténués par des politiques actives du marché du travail, telles qu’une politique de 
formation appropriée, qui ont une incidence très efficace et ciblée sur la dépréciation du 
capital humain. 
 
 
1.2 Ensuite, en Europe, la BCE a considérablement assoupli sa politique monétaire ces 
dernières années, même après avoir atteint les limites de la politique monétaire 
conventionnelle.

hausse du chômage structurel ? » Bulletin de la Banque de France, Banque de France, n° 198, 4ème trimestre 
2014. 
4 
 
Mais cette récession n’a pas été ordinaire car elle s’est accompagnée d’une crise financière 
aigüe : l’histoire montre que les récessions associées à des crises financières peuvent avoir 
un impact encore plus durable sur les performances économiques. Lors des crises 
financières, les contraintes de crédit peuvent se durcir considérablement pour les banques et 
pour les entreprises et les ménages, ce qui porte ensuite préjudice à la croissance du capital 
physique et de la productivité du travail. 
 
Les contraintes de financement peuvent entraîner une augmentation des défaillances 
d’entreprises. Cette évolution peut ne pas être préjudiciable à la croissance à long terme si 
elle a un « cleansing effect », c’est-à-dire si les entreprises et les équipements non 
performants disparaissent et libèrent des ressources pour les jeunes entreprises 
innovantes
3
. Cependant, elle peut également affecter des entreprises jeunes, innovantes et 
risquées, qui sont plus fragiles et financièrement dépendantes
4
. Selon Foster, Grim et 
Haltiwanger
5
, la réallocation aux États-Unis lors de la Grande récession a été moins 
intensive et moins stimulante pour la productivité qu’en temps normal, contrairement aux 
précédentes récessions. Une baisse similaire de la réallocation a été observée au Royaume-
Uni par la Banque d'Angleterre
6
.   
 
Les contraintes de financement affectent également plus particulièrement le financement de 
la R&D : selon une étude de la Banque de France
7
, la part de l’investissement en R&D 
devient procyclique lorsque les contraintes de crédit se durcissent et n’augmente pas 
proportionnellement en période de reprise. La Grande récession ayant été mondiale, les 
années perdues d’efforts de R&D ne peuvent pas être rattrapées par l’achat de technologie à 
l’étranger, puisque tous les pays ont été affectés. À moyen terme, cette situation pèsera sur 
la croissance de la productivité, qui est alimentée en partie par l’innovation technique. 
 
Les contraintes de financement peuvent contribuer à la baisse de l’investissement, 
notamment dans les industries dépendant plus largement du financement externe ou ayant

une plus faible tangibilité des actifs
8
, ce qui peut ralentir la formation de stock de capital et 
donc la croissance potentielle, mais également entraîner son vieillissement et peser sur sa 
productivité en raison de l’utilisation d’équipements plus anciens. Comme le montre une 
étude de la Banque de France
9
, la Grande dépression et la Grande récession ont toutes 
deux entraîné un vieillissement significatif du stock des équipements. 
 
Le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE est particulièrement conscient des vives tensions 
auxquelles le système financier a été soumis ces dernières années, ainsi que des 
perturbations du canal du crédit. Il craignait notamment que le processus de désendettement 
bancaire réduise l'offre de crédit et compromette les effets bénéfiques d'une réduction des 
taux d'intérêt sur les bilans des entreprises, ce qui aurait pu être un frein considérable pour la 
politique monétaire. Cela a renforcé les arguments en faveur d'une action décisive. 
 
Afin de remédier aux perturbations du canal du crédit, le Conseil des gouverneurs a lancé 
deux programmes d'opérations de refinancement ciblées, en complément des autres 
mesures non conventionnelles qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de rappeler. Ces deux séries 
d'opérations, TLTRO I et II, permettent aux banques d'emprunter à hauteur d'un pourcentage 
fixe de leurs portefeuilles de prêts, à un taux d'intérêt lié aux taux directeurs de la BCE. Les 
banques qui consentent un montant de prêts nouveaux supérieur à la valeur de référence 
bénéficient d'un coût de financement moyen moins élevé. Ces opérations sont une incitation 
puissante à accroître l'offre de prêts et contribuent en partie à atténuer les risques de 
financement lorsque les taux d'intérêt nominaux sont négatifs. 
 
Toujours en vue de relancer le canal du crédit, le Conseil des gouverneurs a décidé en 
mars 2016 d'inclure dans son programme d'achats d'actifs les obligations émises par des 
sociétés. Cela devrait réduire directement le coût de l'emprunt sur les marchés de capitaux 
pour les entreprises. 
 
Dans l'ensemble, ces mesures ont contribué efficacement à l’assouplissement des 
conditions du crédit dans la zone euro. Le volume des prêts consentis par les banques aux 
sociétés non financières a recommencé à augmenter et les taux débiteurs des banques ont 
diminué dans l'ensemble de la zone euro, mais plus notablement dans les pays où les 
conditions s'étaient le plus durcies.

2. La politique monétaire peut favoriser la croissance à long terme en soutenant 
les réformes structurelles  
 
La crise financière a, dans une certaine mesure, fait apparaître diverses faiblesses 
structurelles dans de nombreuses économies. Certains pays ont affiché des niveaux de dette 
publique excessifs

. D'autres se sont heurtés à des obstacles structurels au flux des 
ressources, notamment sur le marché du travail et dans l’allocation du crédit entre les 
différents secteurs, signe qu'un dysfonctionnement du secteur financier peut aggraver les 
faiblesses structurelles
11
. Dans d'autres pays, les deux symptômes étaient présents.   
 
Les changements structurels axés sur l'amélioration du suivi et de la capacité de résistance 
de notre système financier sont de la plus haute importance. À l'évidence, la crise financière 
a résulté en partie d'une prise de risque excessive et d'un surinvestissement dans les 
secteurs à faible productivité
12
. Le dispositif Bâle 3 à l'échelle mondiale et le mécanisme de 
surveillance unique pour la zone euro constituent de nouveaux outils de surveillance 
prudentielle qui permettront de limiter ces risques dans le futur.  
 
Cela étant, de nombreux pays de la zone euro ont dû aussi procéder à d'importants 
ajustements budgétaires et mettre en œuvre de vastes réformes structurelles. 
 
Malheureusement, nombre de ces réformes structurelles sont susceptibles d'avoir un effet 
déflationniste temporaire. C'est le cas des réformes sur les marchés de biens et services, qui 
ciblent directement la baisse des prix, mais également des réformes favorisant l'offre lorsque 
la demande est atone. La concurrence accrue dans le domaine des télécommunications a 
entraîné une baisse spectaculaire des prix : en France, l'arrivée d'un quatrième opérateur de 
téléphonie mobile s'est traduite par une diminution des coûts de 25 % dans ce domaine et 
par un impact négatif sur l'IPC moyen de 0,3 point en 2012. Des effets désinflationnistes 
similaires ont été observés dans de nombreux pays de la zone euro dits en difficulté.  
 
Or, au stade actuel, les réformes structurelles sont absolument indispensables en raison du 
ralentissement de la productivité, et des réformes plus importantes doivent être envisagées

sur les marchés des biens et services et du travail dans les pays très réglementés
13
. Dans ce 
cas, il est primordial pour la banque centrale d'ancrer les anticipations d'inflation par un 
engagement clair à l'égard de son objectif d'inflation. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a annoncé 
clairement qu'il était disposé à mettre en œuvre toutes les mesures nécessaires dans le 
cadre de son mandat pour réaliser son objectif, c'est-à-dire une inflation totale proche de, 
mais inférieure à, 2 % à moyen terme. 
 
Les réformes structurelles peuvent également avoir une incidence négative à court terme sur 
l'emploi et sur la croissance, en particulier dans un contexte de ralentissement 
économique
14
. À cet égard, la politique monétaire peut apporter un soutien bénéfique à la 
croissance, tout comme la politique budgétaire. 
 
Les diverses mesures mises en œuvre par le Conseil des gouverneurs depuis 2014 en 
faveur d’une orientation accommodante de sa politique monétaire ont déjà eu de très bons 
résultats en termes de soutien à la croissance nominale. Même si l'inflation totale est 
actuellement négative, elle aurait été beaucoup plus faible (de 80 points de base environ 
en 2016 d'après les estimations de l'Eurosystème) sans ces interventions. La croissance 
économique réelle est légèrement plus soutenue et le chômage moins élevé. 
 
Toutefois, il est important de souligner que la politique monétaire a pour rôle d'accompagner 
les réformes structurelles et non pas de s'y substituer. Une politique de relance monétaire ne 
peut servir d'excuse pour reporter les réformes structurelles. 
 
En effet, on a parfois l'impression que les banques centrales ont pour unique responsabilité 
de soutenir la croissance à court terme. Ce n'est pas une position confortable pour nous et 
ce ne devrait être acceptable pour aucun d'entre vous. L’orientation accommodante de notre 
politique monétaire a nettement réduit le coût de l'investissement mais son efficacité est 
légèrement émoussée si les chefs d'entreprise se heurtent à des obstacles structurels et à 
un manque de réforme sur le plan économique. Cela fait maintenant de nombreuses années 
que l'OCDE recommande vivement d'accélérer le rythme des réformes structurelles et 
j'aimerais que davantage de gouvernements l'écoutent.

Cependant, la politique monétaire et les réformes structurelles nationales ne peuvent pas 
être les seules parties à jouer. Il nous faut améliorer le dosage global des politiques 
économiques. Dans un contexte de politique monétaire accommodante et d'accélération des 
réformes économiques, nous avons besoin d'une politique budgétaire plus souple et mieux 
ciblée à l'échelle européenne. On pourrait faire davantage, par exemple, pour accroître 
l'investissement dans les infrastructures publiques, dans l'éducation et dans l'apprentissage 
en Europe du Sud. Les dépenses budgétaires pourraient être réorientées vers les 
programmes de formation à un nouveau métier ou d'autres mesures favorisant le transfert 
des ressources entre secteurs.  
 
L’un des aspects de nos problèmes actuels est que le taux d'intérêt réel à court terme naturel 
est trop faible, en raison d'un niveau d’investissement ex ante insuffisant par rapport à 
l'épargne. La BCE a donné une orientation très accommodante à sa politique monétaire, à 
l'aide d'instruments non conventionnels, pour contribuer à faire baisser le taux nominal 
effectif. Une meilleure solution à long terme consisterait à faire augmenter le taux d'intérêt 
réel naturel grâce à un renforcement de la croissance économique et de l'investissement. 
 
 
 
Conclusion : 
Comme pour de nombreux autres concepts et politiques économiques, la Grande récession 
nous a amené à réexaminer le rôle joué par les banques centrales dans la croissance à 
moyen et long terme. Outre la contribution normale qu’elles apportent à la croissance à long 
terme par leur rôle de gardiens de la stabilité des prix, les banques centrales en période de 
profonde récession doivent agir contre les effets d'hystérèse de la crise et contre les 
dommages causés par le dysfonctionnement du secteur financier. Tous les indicateurs, de 
l'adéquation entre l’offre et la demande sur le marché du travail à la réallocation des 
ressources entre les entreprises, ont montré la gravité des chocs liés à la Grande récession, 
justifiant une réaction de grande ampleur et déterminée de la politique économique partout 
dans le monde.  
Dans le cadre de cette réaction de la politique économique à l'échelle mondiale, on peut 
difficilement affirmer que les banques centrales n'ont pas fait leur part du travail.  
 
Toutefois, dans les circonstances actuelles, chacun doit faire sa part des efforts. S'agissant 
plus particulièrement de la zone euro, je suis convaincu que nous obtiendrions de bien 
meilleurs résultats avec la mise en œuvre de politiques budgétaires plus propices à la 
croissance, notamment dans les États membres disposant d'une marge de manœuvre 
9 
 
budgétaire, et simultanément de réformes structurelles plus ambitieuses, notamment dans 
les États membres qui n'ont pas de marge de manœuvre budgétaire.  
 
En effet, voilà probablement le reproche le plus subtil que l'on puisse faire à la politique 
monétaire active que mènent actuellement les banques centrales : est-elle prétexte à 
l'inaction des autres autorités publiques, en particulier du point de vue des réformes 
structurelles ? Nous ne pouvons pas, en guise de réponse, arrêter de faire notre travail mais, 
forts de la légitimité que nous confèrent nos propres actions, nous pouvons inciter 
fermement les gouvernements à agir davantage. En particulier dans mon propre pays, ici à 
Paris, les réformes sont nécessaires, comme je l'ai souligné dans ma récente Lettre au 
Président il y a quelques jours. Mais les réformes sont également possibles. Oui, la France 
elle aussi, comme nombre de ses voisins européens ayant fait leurs preuves, est 
« réformable ».  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention et vous souhaite un excellent dîner.

PRÉSENTATION DU RAPPORT D’ACTIVITÉ DE L’AUTORITE DE CONTRÔLE 
PRUDENTIEL ET DE RÉSOLUTION POUR 2015 
Conférence de presse du lundi 23 mai 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
J’ai le plaisir de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour cette conférence de presse de présentation 
du sixième rapport d’activité de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, l’ACPR et, 
pour moi, c’est la première fois. 
L’ACPR a su, au cours de ces dernières années, s’adapter et se restructurer constamment 
afin de répondre aux multiples évolutions qu’a connues l’exercice de son rôle de superviseur. 
Adossée à la Banque de France qui lui fournit notamment ses 1 065 agents, l’Autorité est 
garante de la stabilité du système financier français et de la protection de la clientèle. 
J’aborderai successivement cinq points pour souligner : 
<U+F02D> l’évolution de la régulation internationale des secteurs de la banque et de l’assurance ; 
<U+F02D> le renforcement de la dimension européenne de la supervision prudentielle ; 
<U+F02D> l’action de supervision en matière de protection de la clientèle et de lutte contre le 
blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme ; 
<U+F02D> la stabilité financière dans une situation de taux historiquement bas; 
<U+F02D> malgré ces défis, les résultats très satisfaisants des établissements bancaires en 2015, 
confortant ainsi encore davantage leur situation de solvabilité.  
Bernard Delas, vice-président de l’ACPR, vous commentera par la suite l’actualité 
prudentielle du secteur de l’assurance. Enfin, Rémi Bouchez présentera l’activité de la 
Commission des sanctions. 
 
   
2 
 
I – En 2015, l’ACPR a été activement engagée dans l’évolution de la régulation 
internationale des secteurs de la banque et de l’assurance  
Les équipes de l’ACPR sont impliquées dans tous les groupes de travail internationaux qui 
préparent les évolutions de la régulation bancaire, que ce soit dans le cadre du Comité de 
Bâle ou celui de l’Autorité bancaire européenne (ABE). 
Au niveau bâlois, l’enjeu est – après les études d’impact qui ont beaucoup occupé 2015 et 
se poursuivent en ce début d’année – d’achever la réforme dite de Bâle 3 d’ici la fin de 
l’année 2016 tout en veillant à la stabilisation du niveau global des exigences 
réglementaires. Le travail de renforcement de la régulation mené depuis la crise a été 
considérable mais il était indispensable et n’a pas pesé sur la croissance. Il ne s’agit pas 
aujourd’hui d’augmenter encore significativement les exigences globales en capital imposées 
au système bancaire, il n’y a pas de  « chantier » Bâle 4 à ouvrir, mais de finaliser le chantier 
des réformes post-crise : le G20 l’a redit à Washington en avril, le Comité de Bâle doit le 
faire. 
Le G20 a aussi publié en novembre 2015 les modalités finales de l’exigence de capacité 
d’absorption des pertes (TLAC - Total Loss Absorbing Capacity). En cas de crise bancaire, 
les autorités de résolution pourront mobiliser des passifs répondant à des critères précis 
pour absorber les pertes et reconstituer les fonds propres des banques d’importance 
systémique mondiale (G-SIB), tout en assurant la protection des déposants. C’est un 
élément important du dispositif post-crise. 
Dans le domaine de l’assurance, l’ACPR joue un rôle tout aussi actif,  notamment avec la 
mise en œuvre de la directive « Solvabilité II », entrée en application depuis le 1
er
 janvier 
dernier,  Bernard Delas reviendra  sur ce point tout à l’heure. 
Concernant la protection de la clientèle, l’ACPR a contribué aux travaux de l’ABE portant sur 
des orientations relatives au crédit hypothécaire. D’importants travaux ont également été 
menés sur l’harmonisation en matière de gouvernance des produits offerts à la clientèle par 
les secteurs de la banque et de l’assurance. 
 
II – L’Autorité a pleinement pris part au renforcement de la dimension européenne de 
la supervision prudentielle 
Dans le domaine bancaire, les travaux de contrôle ont bien évidemment été fortement 
orientés par la mise en œuvre opérationnelle du Mécanisme de Supervision Unique (MSU). Il 
s’est agi, pour nous d’être un acteur central dans la nouvelle organisation européenne du 
contrôle, avec une dimension plus transversale par rapport à ce qui existait avant le MSU. 
   
3 
 
Après son lancement le 4 novembre 2014, l’année 2015 a été la première année complète 
de fonctionnement du MSU et des équipes conjointes de contrôle (Joint Supervisory Teams 
– JST), composées de personnels issus de la Banque centrale européenne et des autorités 
nationales compétentes. Une JST a été mise en place pour chacun des 123 groupes 
bancaires significatifs. Ces équipes, dirigées par un coordinateur BCE et un sous-
coordinateur au sein de l’autorité nationale concernée, ont réalisé en 2015 la première revue 
exhaustive et harmonisée des risques de ces groupes selon une méthodologie commune, 
dite «SREP » (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process) ; une charge de travail 
considérable pour l’ensemble des JST, qui a été remplie avec succès. En 2016, ces 
évaluations vont être renouvelées et elles intègreront notamment les tests de résistance en 
cours et mis en œuvre par l’ABE et la BCE, en collaboration avec les autorités nationales. 
L’année dernière, le MSU a également procédé à des analyses thématiques transversales 
avec l’objectif d’accroître la comparabilité et la convergence des approches. Trois aspects 
principaux ont été couverts : l’appréciation du risque de gouvernance, les activités à effet de 
levier, ainsi que les risques liés à la cyber-sécurité des établissements.  La convergence, elle 
est aussi renforcée par la revue réalisée de plus de 120 options et discrétions nationales en 
matière de réglementation. Des mesures d’harmonisation entreront en vigueur courant 2016 
afin d’assurer progressivement une mise en œuvre cohérente de CRD4 à l’ensemble de la 
zone euro. Le premier pilier de l’Union bancaire – la supervision – est d’ores et déjà une 
réussite.  
L’année 2015 aura également été très fortement marquée par la thématique de la résolution 
– le second pilier – notamment avec la transposition en droit français de la directive sur le 
redressement et la résolution des établissements de crédit et des entreprises 
d’investissement, dite « BRRD ». Par ailleurs, au niveau européen, le Mécanisme de 
résolution unique (MRU) s’est graduellement mis en place, et son instance de décision, le 
Conseil de résolution unique (CRU) est pleinement entrée en fonction le 1
er
 janvier dernier. Il 
est souhaitable qu’il soit pleinement partie prenante de l’Union bancaire,  qui doit aligner 
Bruxelles – où est le MRU – et Francfort – où est le MSU. 
III – L’ACPR a également renforcé son action de supervision en matière de protection 
de la clientèle et de lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme 
L’ACPR a pour mission de veiller à la protection de la clientèle en matière de produits 
bancaires ou d’assurance, ceci est une responsabilité pleinement nationale. En 2015, 
l’ACPR a ainsi traité plus de 7 300 demandes et réclamations, un nombre en très forte 
augmentation par rapport à 2014 (+31%). À ce titre, l’ACPR est tout particulièrement 
vigilante à la bonne application de la loi dite « loi Eckert » relative aux comptes bancaires 
   
4 
 
inactifs et aux contrats d’assurance vie en déshérence : elle a, sur ce sujet, publié le 2 mai le 
rapport prévu par le Parlement qui a montré de gros progrès. 
C’est avec cette même vigilance, mais également avec un grand intérêt, que l’ACPR aborde 
le fort développement actuel des « Fintech ». La mise en place, au sein de l’ACPR, d’un(e) 
responsable Fintech innovation qui travaillera en étroite coopération avec l’AMF fait partie de 
cette ambition.  
Notre souci permanent du respect de la réglementation en vigueur est  également, et plus 
que jamais, présent dans l’action de l’ACPR en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment des 
capitaux et le financement du terrorisme (LCB-FT). La place financière, banques et 
assurances, est mobilisée mais c’est un domaine d’exemplarité d’importance majeure et 
chaque acteur doit garder à l’esprit que les obligations et diligences dans ce domaine ne 
peuvent qu’être amenées à croître. 
De plus, tous les acteurs sont vivement encouragés à établir une déclaration de soupçon 
auprès de Tracfin dès qu’un doute survient. En parallèle, l’ACPR a mené des actions de 
contrôle permanent sur la base d’un questionnaire et nos missions de contrôle sur place (22 
en 2015 et plusieurs dizaines en 2016, y compris en intégrant les informations post 
« Panama Papers »). Nous le faisons en coopération de plus en plus étroite avec les 
autorités de supervision étrangères, et nous accueillons favorablement bien-sûr tout ce qui 
renforcera, clarifiera, sécurisera le cadre de cette coopération. Si dans le cadre de nos 
enquêtes des manquements sont relevés,  des sanctions (5 en 2015) sont prononcées.  
Rémi Bouchez reviendra tout à l’heure sur ce point. 
IV – Le contexte macroéconomique, caractérisé par une situation de taux 
historiquement bas, fait l’objet d’une attention particulière de l’ACPR dans le but de 
préserver la stabilité financière 
Le contexte économique particulier lié à la situation, inédite en France et en Europe, de taux 
bas est un élément important de la politique monétaire pour soutenir l’activité économique, 
faciliter la distribution du crédit dans des conditions favorables (+ 4 % sur les encours à fin 
mars) et ainsi améliorer la situation des agents non financiers.  
À cet égard, je tiens à souligner que la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème a eu 
globalement, en 2015, un impact positif sur la rentabilité et à la solvabilité des banques de la 
zone euro. La baisse des taux courts et l’aplatissement de la courbe des taux ont réduit la 
marge nette d’intérêt des banques, mais l’accroissement des volumes de crédit vient 
partiellement compenser le premier effet ; la baisse des taux améliore la solvabilité et la 
qualité de crédit des emprunteurs, ce qui se traduit par une baisse du coût du risque. Les 
   
5 
 
banques bénéficient enfin d’une réduction du coût de leurs émissions de dette, via 
notamment le TLTRO. 
Mais, il est vrai aussi que les taux bas prolongés peuvent affecter la rentabilité des secteurs 
bancaire et assurantiel.  
C’est donc un point d’attention avec aussi une interrogation vis-à-vis des exigences des 
investisseurs en ce qui concerne le rendement des capitaux engagés, qui devraient être 
révisées à la baisse dans ce nouvel environnement de taux sans risque plus bas. Face à ce 
risque, l’ACPR suit tout particulièrement les modèles d’affaires les plus exposés. Dans le 
secteur de l’assurance, le contexte de taux bas conduit à une situation où les rendements 
des titres entrant en portefeuille sont inférieurs aux taux servis sur leurs polices d’assurance 
vie. J’appelle donc de nouveau les organismes à la prudence dans la fixation des taux de 
revalorisation de leurs contrats d’assurance vie. 
En outre, j’encourage les pouvoirs publics et les professionnels à poursuivre leur réflexion en 
matière de réorientation de l’épargne, notamment via le développement de nouveaux 
produits d’épargne de long terme, répondant à la fois à l’environnement de taux bas et aux 
besoins de long terme des ménages (retraites). Ces nouveaux produits d’épargne pourraient 
être moins liquides, assortis probablement d’une protection en capital sur le long terme : ils 
permettraient aux ménages de bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions sur la durée, 
tout en favorisant le financement de l’investissement des entreprises. Pour permettre leur 
développement, il conviendrait, à tout le moins, d’éviter des distorsions fiscales au détriment 
de ces produits par rapport à l’épargne liquide et sans risque. 
V – Malgré ces difficultés et les défis qui attendent les établissements, ceux-ci ont 
réalisé des résultats très satisfaisants en 2015, confortant ainsi encore davantage leur 
situation de solvabilité 
Le produit net bancaire (PNB) des six plus grands groupes bancaires  ressort en hausse de 
5,1%, au niveau consolidé, entre 2014 et 2015. On note en particulier la résilience de la 
banque de détail, soutenue par la reprise progressive de la demande de crédits, notamment 
à l’habitat et à la consommation pour les ménages, et de crédits à l’équipement pour les 
entreprises. Les activités de banque de financement et d’investissement (BFI) et de 
financements spécialisés ont également réalisé un bon exercice en 2015. Le résultat net part 
du groupe (RNPG) de ces six grandes banques atteint 23,7 milliards d’euros en 2015 (soit 
+65,9 % et +9,4 milliards d’euros par rapport à 2014). Toutefois, l’année 2014 avait été 
marquée par des charges exceptionnelles de forte ampleur. Une fois retraité ces éléments 
exceptionnels, le RNPG ressort néanmoins en hausse de 8%. 
   
6 
 
Ces bonnes performances permettent aux établissements d’affecter une part substantielle de 
ces résultats au renforcement de leurs fonds propres. On observe ainsi une amélioration des 
ratios de solvabilité Common equity tier 1 (CET1) « full CRD4 ». Le ratio de solvabilité 
agrégé de ces six groupes bancaires atteint donc 12,6 % à fin 2015, soit bien au-delà des 
exigences règlementaires et a plus que doublé par rapport à 2008. Les fonds propres 
« durs » (CET1) des banques françaises ont doublé entre décembre 2008 et décembre 
2015, passant de 132 à 275 milliards d’euros. Leur ratio de liquidité est supérieur à 100 % 
pour chaque groupe avec trois ans d’avance sur l’échéance réglementaire de 2018. Le 
système bancaire est aujourd’hui solide, parmi les plus solides d’Europe et des économies 
avancées : nous l’avons, avec le ministre des Finances redit au G7 de Shanghai ce week-
end. Ceci vaut aussi pour le marché de l’assurance. 
C’est donc avec confiance et détermination que nous abordons cette année 2016 qui sera, 
comme les précédentes, riche d’enjeux et d’évolutions. Au regard de ce que les 
établissements et les organismes ont su relever comme défis au cours de ces dernières 
années, je ne doute pas qu’ils sauront également bien aborder ces nouvelles échéances. 
Quant aux agents de l’ACPR, sachez qu’ils sauront rester mobilisés pour les accompagner 
dans ces transformations. J’ai toute confiance en leur dynamisme, leur expertise et leur 
professionnalisme pour la conduite de ces évolutions. 
Je cède maintenant la parole à Bernard Delas, vice-président de l’ACPR. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Comité Place de Paris 2020 : « La finance au service de l’économie » 
Lundi 30 mai 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Monsieur le Ministre, Monsieur le Président de Paris Europlace, Mesdames et Messieurs,  
 
Comme vous m’y avez invité, Monsieur le Ministre des Finances et des comptes publics, je 
suis très heureux de prendre la parole sur une réforme qui contribuera à soutenir la 
compétitivité des circuits de financement de notre économie.  
  
Nous réformons aujourd’hui le marché des titres de créances négociables qui est le principal 
marché de titres à court et moyen terme de la zone euro, et offre des financements 
compétitifs et diversifiés, en euros ou autres monnaies, en complément des autres 
instruments de financement. Il réunit un vaste écosystème constitué d’investisseurs, 
d’émetteurs financiers et non financiers de premier plan, et d’infrastructures post-marché 
robustes. 
 
Avec la Direction générale du Trésor, nous avons engagé cette modernisation, sous l’égide 
du Comité Place de Paris 2020, à la suite d’une large concertation avec la Place. Je saisis 
l’occasion qui m’est donnée aujourd’hui pour saluer l’engagement de tous les participants 
(associations professionnelles, intervenants de marché, infrastructures de marché, cabinets 
d’avocats, agences de notation, …) ainsi que la qualité du dialogue qui a été conduit dans ce 
cadre entre acteurs privés et publics. 
 
J’en viens maintenant aux objectifs et aux grandes lignes de la réforme.  
 
Du point de vue des pouvoirs publics, nous avons l’objectif d’encourager le financement de 
l’économie réelle et une meilleure intégration des marchés en Europe : à ce titre, nous 
souhaitons mettre le marché au service d’un plus grand nombre d’acteurs en France et à 
l’étranger, ainsi qu’au service des entreprises de taille intermédiaire.  
 
Pour les acteurs de marché, la réforme crée de nouvelles classes d’actifs aux règles de 
fonctionnement bien alignées sur les standards internationaux, avec une base 
d'investisseurs et d'émetteurs large et des conditions de liquidité attractives.  
 
Dans les grandes lignes, cette réforme se traduit par plusieurs avancées : 
 
Premier point, une plus grande lisibilité au travers de :  
 
2 
 
<U+F0FC> La fusion des titres de créances négociables d’une maturité inférieure à un an (anciens 
certificats de dépôts émis par les établissements de crédit, et anciens billets de trésorerie 
émis par les émetteurs non financiers) réunis sous la dénomination de « titres 
négociables à court terme » ;  
 
<U+F0FC> La nouvelle appellation commerciale de ces titres, qui vient d’être annoncée par le 
Ministre des Finances, et a été choisie par la Place (« Negotiable European Commercial 
Paper » -NEU CP prononcé « new CP ») afin d’exprimer directement la nature de 
l’instrument, sa maturité et la présence d’intervenants européens ; 
 
<U+F0FC> L’alignement de la dénomination juridique des titres d’une maturité supérieure à un an : 
titres négociables à moyen terme (anciennement « bons à moyen terme négociables »). 
 
Deuxième point, une plus grande accessibilité avec :  
  
<U+F0FC> La possibilité de rédiger la documentation financière dans une langue usuelle en matière 
financière, autre que le français, sans obligation de produire un résumé en français, 
possibilité très attendue de la part des principaux participants de marché ;  
 
<U+F0FC> Ensuite, une ouverture aux émetteurs internationaux appuyée sur un cadre élargi sur un 
plan comptable ( avec la reconnaissance des normes comptables locales des pays de 
l’Espace économique européen, ainsi que pour les émetteurs de pays-tiers des normes 
comptables et de contrôle légal des comptes reconnues par la Commission européenne 
comme équivalentes aux standards européens) ;  
 
<U+F0FC> Un choix pour la notation éventuelle des programmes d’émission élargi à toutes les 
agences enregistrées auprès de l’Autorité Européenne des Marchés Financiers (ESMA). 
 
Troisième point, enfin, une plus grande simplicité :  
 
<U+F0FC> Des textes réglementaires : un arrêté, au lieu de quatre précédemment, pris après avis de 
la Banque centrale européenne du 30 mars 2016 ; 
 
<U+F0FC> Des processus de post-marché grâce en particulier à l’allocation en temps réel des codes 
ISIN des titres souhaitée par les investisseurs internationaux pour sécuriser leurs 
transactions. 
 
Voilà désormais le marché modernisé, tout en en conservant ses atouts notamment en 
termes de transparence et de surveillance des conditions d'émission par la Banque de 
France, il appartient maintenant à l’ensemble des acteurs économiques d'en faire le meilleur 
usage. 
 
Monsieur le Ministre, Monsieur le Président de Paris Europlace, Mesdames et Messieurs, je 
vous remercie pour votre attention.

Séminaire de recherche Banque de France - Sciences Po  
""Les banques et le système financier : quelle régulation ?""  
Paris, le 7 juin 2016 
 
« La stabilité financière dans un monde digital » 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, Chers amis,  
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir ce soir pour cette table ronde, organisée à 
l’occasion de la parution de la Revue de la Stabilité Financière de la Banque de 
France, dans le cadre du séminaire co-organisé par Sciences -Po et la Banque sur la 
régulation financière. Le thème de notre revue et de cette table ronde porte sur « la 
stabilité financière dans un monde digital ».  
 
Pour assurer la stabilité financière, il y a d'abord la stabilité des prix. L'Eurosystème y 
est engagé : nos décisions et nos prévisions de Vienne ne sont pas un mode ""wait 
and see"". C'est claire ment une attitude ""act and see"". Agir pour mettre en œuvre tout 
le paquet décidé en mars : juin marquera le début du TLTRO 2 et des achats 
d'obligations d'entreprises; priorité donc à la qualité de l'implementation, sans qu'il 
soit besoin aujourd'hui de mesures supplémentaires. Et voir avec cette mise en 
œuvre quelle est l’amplification de l’impact de notre politique monétaire active. Nos 
prévisions en donnent déjà une première mesure : l'inflation devrait redevenir 
positive en deuxième moitié de cette année, et s'amplifier en 2017 et 2018. La 
reprise européenne se confirme comme prévu, à 1,6 % pour la zone euro, et en 
France avec au moins 1,4 % et un fort investissement des entreprises (+3,4 %). Mais 
ceci ne suffit pas : nous avons aussi dit qu'il était souhaitable de démultiplier cette 
reprise, et les effets de la politique monétaire,  par des réformes dans chaque pays 
comme au niveau européen.

I. Pourquoi le régulateur doit s’intéresser à la finance digitale ? 
 
Nous avons vécu, au cours de ces dernières années, une vague d’innovations 
portées par les nouvelles technologies numériques et informatiques, qui ont tout 
naturellement trouvé un champ d’application dans le domaine des services 
financiers. Plusieurs facteurs y ont contribué : technologiques bien sûr mais aussi 
des facteurs réglementaires, ayant contribué à la hausse du coût de l’intermédiation 
et favorisé l’émergence de solutions concurrentes ; la crise enfin, avec une image 
dégradée des banques auprès du public et l’essor des monnaies virtuelles. 
 
S’il est aujourd’hui difficile d’anticiper les conséquences de ces nouvelles 
technologies sur le fonctionnement futur du système financier, certaines innovations, 
sur lesquelles nous reviendrons ce soir, telles que la Blockchain ou le Registre 
distribué (Distributed ledger), rendent aujourd’hui techniquement possible, pour la 
première fois dans l’histoire, l’émergence d’un système complétement décentralisé, 
c’est-à-dire où les transactions pourraient potentiellement s’opérer sans 
intermédiaires financiers et sans banque centrale. Tout cela n’est cependant pas 
sans risques, notamment opérationnels, en particulier pour le consommateur, 
aujourd’hui capable d’effectuer quasiment sans délai et sans coût toutes sortes 
d’opérations bancaires, de paiement, de placement ou d’investissement. 
 
Ces nouvelles technologies sont, tout d’abord, potentiellement porteuses de grands 
bénéfices pour l’individu et la société. Elles répondent aux besoins des utilisateurs 
(services personnalisés et fluides par l’exploitation des informations disponibles sur 
le consommateur, ses habitudes, ses comportements, ses goûts). Ce sont ensuite 
des sources importantes de gains de productivité mais également de forte réduction 
des coûts de transactions, favorable à l’augmentation de la concurrence au sein du 
secteur financier, et ce au bénéfice du client et plus généralement du financement de 
l’économie.  
 
Les services offerts par ces nouvelles technologies digitales couvrent la quasi-totalité 
des services financiers : la digitalisation des services bancaires ; les moyens de 
paiements, avec la possibilité d’effectuer des paiements directs via son smart phone ; 
les services de paiement, tels les agrégateurs de comptes ou les initiateurs de 
paiements ; la gestion de portefeuille ou des placements, via l’accélération de la 
digitalisation des services aux clients particuliers (« robot advisors » pour le conseil 
financier en ligne), dans la réalisation des opérations de marché elles-mêmes 
(trading haute fréquence) ou enfin dans le domaine du financement  avec le 
crowdfunding.  
 
Il y a notamment un enjeu particulier autour des Fintechs dont les activités sont 
multiples et couvrent pratiquement tous les domaines de la finance, qu’elle soit 
intermédiée ou non. L’association d’Alain Clot en rassemble plus d’une cinquantaine, 
dont 62% sont aujourd’hui régulées du fait de leur activité par l’ACPR (71 %), l’AMF 
(21 %) ou les deux autorités (8 %). Ces nouveaux acteurs représentent encore une 
part marginale de l’activité mais leur essor est notable. Au-delà des Fin Techs dont 
certaines deviendront peut-être des Big Techs - ou pas, notre regard doit se porter 
aussi - voire surtout - vers les GAFA et les opérateurs télécom qui présentent des 
atouts significatifs à l’heure de la finance digitale (base de clientèle/réseau, capacité 
à analyser et à valoriser la donnée client). 
3 
 
 
Nous devons cependant rester attentifs aux risques, en particulier ceux portant sur la 
sécurité des transactions (paiements mobiles, monnaies virtuelles…) ; la 
cybercriminalité, en très forte augmentation en partie du fait de la multiplication des 
objets connectés qui recèlent de nombreuses failles de sécurité exploitables par les 
cybercriminels ; la protection du consommateur  et la lutte contre le blanchiment des 
capitaux et le financement du terrorisme, ainsi que les risques de conformité, la 
relation client étant au cœur du business model de ces innovations.  
 
II. Comment gérer trois objectifs apparemment divergents ? 
 
Nous devons, dans ce contexte, construire un triangle de compatibilité entre 
innovations, stabilité et régulation. L’innovation ne doit en effet pas se traduire par un 
nivellement par le bas de la sécurité. La Banque de France et l’ACPR l’ont 
récemment rappelé à l’égard des monnaies virtuelles. Pour autant, il ne faut pas non 
plus freiner ou brider son essor au point de la fragiliser voire de la condamner. Nous 
devons donc trouver un équilibre subtil entre différents objectifs : simplifier les 
démarches sans pour autant déréguler ; viser au développement d’un cadre souple 
mais sécurisé par une application proportionnelle des règles. 
 
La Banque de France et l’ACPR sont parties prenantes de ces évolutions en tant que 
garantes de la stabilité financière. Deux principes fondamentaux ont ainsi guidé notre 
réflexion et structuré notre plan d’action : 
 
Premièrement,  un principe absolu de sécurité des paiements, des opérations et des 
données.  
 
Je souhaite en particulier revenir sur le strict respect des obligations en matière de 
lutte contre le blanchiment des capitaux et le financement du terrorisme. La 
responsabilité des acteurs (en termes de conformité et, de manière plus profonde, en 
termes d’éthique) sera particulièrement importante en ce qui concerne l’usage des 
données clients, qui constitue un des enjeux fondamentaux de l’ère digitale. 
 
Deuxièmement, un principe relatif de proportionnalité dans la supervision. Nous 
visons ici à : adapter la réglementation à la taille et aux risques encourus par les 
acteurs, comme c’est par exemple le cas de l’agrément allégé d’établissement de 
paiement ou d’établissement de monnaie électronique (régime « small business ») et 
nous serons à l’écoute du marché sur ce sujet ; adapter également notre supervision, 
via une coopération renforcée ACPR-AMF pour les projets innovants impliquant les 
deux autorités et la création d’une équipe dédiée aux Fintech-Innovation à l’ACPR, 
s’appuyant en particulier sur un site ACPR destiné aux Fintechs (en lien avec le site 
AMF) et sur des démarches de communication dédiées à ces acteurs. Cette 
démarche vise à développer le dialogue des deux Autorités avec ces nouveaux 
intervenants, avec le Forum Fintech ou sous la forme d’évènements ad hoc. Je 
réunirai avec Gérard Rameix le premier Forum le 18 juillet prochain. 
 
Ces deux principes doivent toutefois veiller à préserver des conditions équitables de 
concurrence, notamment avec le secteur bancaire - nous sommes donc plus sur une 
approche de supervision en proportionnalité des risques que sur une approche de 
4 
 
type « bac à sable » comme c’est le cas en Grande-Bretagne - et s’inscrire dans un 
cadre de coopération européenne et internationale.   
 
Je voudrais à présent vous présenter nos panélistes dont certains nous ont fait 
l’honneur de contribuer à notre revue. Dans l’ordre de leurs interventions, j’ai tout 
d’abord le plaisir de vous présenter M. Yves Mersch, membre du Directoire de la 
Banque Centrale Européenne, en charge notamment des questions relatives aux 
paiements et aux infrastructures de marché, aux billets et à la gestion des risques. 
Yves vous présentera succinctement son article, qui porte sur l’impact de ces 
nouvelles technologies sur les systèmes de paiement et les infrastructures de 
marché, et plus largement sur le fonctionnement des marchés et la stabilité des 
systèmes financiers. M. Cyril Vignet,  Responsable Projets Innovation pour le groupe 
BPCE, abordera pour sa part la question de l’impact de la digitalisation sur la banque 
et ses métiers, à la fois sous l’angle des ruptures qu’elle pourrait engendrer mais 
également des opportunités qu’elle pourrait créer. M. Serge Darolles, Professeur de 
Finances à l’Université Paris-Dauphine, également contributeur à la Revue, traitera 
de l’essor des Fintechs et de la question de leur régulation. Alain Clot, Président de 
l’Association France Fintech, nous présentera un panorama des Fintechs en France, 
leur contribution au financement de l’activité, leurs risques mais également ses 
attentes vis-à-vis du Superviseur.

Institut allemand pour la recherche économique - DIW - Berlin 
L'Europe à la croisée des chemins : Comment améliorer la gouvernance économique et les 
performances de la zone euro en termes de croissance ? 
Berlin, 8 juin 2016 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
  
Je suis très heureux de cette opportunité qui m'est offerte par le DIW de partager quelques 
réflexions sur l’Europe, ici à Berlin.  
Comme vous le savez peut-être, j'ai des liens forts avec l'Allemagne. En particulier, je partage 
sans réserve l'idée de l'importance de la responsabilité et d’une vision à long terme propre à la 
culture allemande.  
À l'heure actuelle, nous sommes probablement tous d'accord sur deux points - et je mettrai 
l'accent aujourd'hui sur leur étroite imbrication :  
<U+F0B7> La politique monétaire ne peut pas être la seule partie à jouer. 
<U+F0B7> Même si l'Union monétaire est un succès, l’Union économique reste à construire.  
Je tiens à rendre hommage à Helmut Schmidt qui déclarait en octobre 2011 : « Nous n'avons pas 
réussi à définir les règles du jeu économiques pour l'union monétaire. Aucune autorité 
responsable de la politique budgétaire et économique et dotée de pouvoirs forts n'a été créée »1. 
Je soutiendrai tout d'abord que la politique monétaire a fait sa juste part (I). Puis j'évoquerai la 
nécessité d'une « pleine coordination » des politiques économiques nationales dans la zone euro 
et les progrès concrets qui peuvent être réalisés (II). Enfin, s'agissant du partage du risque privé 
dans la zone euro, je mettrai l'accent sur l'importance de la création d'une Union de financement 
et d’investissement efficace (III).

I - LA POLITIQUE MONÉTAIRE REMPLIT SON DEVOIR, ET ELLE A DÉJÀ FAIT 
BEAUCOUP. 
 
Je suis pleinement conscient que certaines décisions de politique monétaire prises récemment par 
le Conseil des gouverneurs font l'objet de vifs débats en Allemagne. Le fait que de telles 
critiques s'expriment souligne, à tout le moins, la nécessité de mieux expliquer nos décisions de 
politique monétaire. Toutefois, je souhaiterais faire valoir que nos récentes décisions de politique 
monétaire sont largement conformes aux principes de stabilité que la culture allemande incarne 
si bien. Permettez-moi de développer trois de ces principes. 
Premièrement, l'indépendance. Les performances divergentes en termes d'inflation qui ont été 
observées dans les principales économies industrialisées après l'effondrement du système de 
Bretton Woods ont profondément influencé la conduite suivie ultérieurement par les banques 
centrales. Sur le plan pratique, on a estimé que l'Allemagne avait traversé l'épisode dit de 
stagflation des années soixante-dix beaucoup mieux que les autres pays. La Bundesbank a joué le 
rôle de modèle pour l'indépendance des autres banques centrales.  
Deuxièmement, un mandat clair pour la stabilité des prix. L'Eurosystème a été bâti sur ces 
fondements tels qu'inscrits dans le traité de Maastricht. Nous avons également adopté, dès 2003, 
une définition quantitative transparente de la stabilité des prix, à savoir un taux d'inflation proche 
de, mais inférieur à 2 % à moyen terme - ce qui est très proche de la définition actuellement 
retenue par la Réserve fédérale américaine,  la Banque d'Angleterre et la Banque du Japon : il n'y 
a donc rien de nouveau ou de spécifique à la BCE.  
Entre 1999 et 2011, la hausse annuelle de l'IPCH est ressortie à 2 % en moyenne dans la zone 
euro, un niveau remarquablement conforme à l'objectif.  
 
Mais depuis lors, l'Eurosystème a rencontré des difficultés pour égaler cette performance. 
L'inflation est nettement inférieure à 2 % depuis trois ans maintenant, l’Allemagne elle-même est 
touchée exactement par ce même phénomène, et la diminution de l’inflation ne peut s'expliquer 
entièrement par le recul des prix du pétrole. Dans le même temps, les anticipations d'inflation se 
3 
sont progressivement inscrites en baisse au cours des trois dernières années. Notre mandat nous 
impose de réagir, afin de protéger l'économie de la zone euro, y compris l'économie allemande, 
du danger mortel de la déflation.  
Troisièmement, la patience qui s’impose au regard d’une perspective à moyen et long 
terme. Dans le monde volatil où nous vivons, nos réactions de politique monétaire ne sont pas 
dictées par les fluctuations économiques à court terme, les surréactions des marchés, les gros 
titres des médias ou les résultats des sondages. Notre crédibilité est également symétrique. Si 
nous tolérons maintenant des écarts prolongés de l'inflation en dessous de 2 %, il existe un risque 
qu'à l'avenir, quand l’inflation se situera au-dessus de ce seuil, notre détermination à la ramener à 
des niveaux proches de, mais inférieurs à 2 % manque de crédibilité. Comme Romer et Romer, 
deux spécialistes américains de l'économie monétaire, l'ont soutenu avec force dans un document 
récent2, l'idée la plus dangereuse pour les banquiers centraux est de penser que la politique 
monétaire ne peut guère agir contre les modifications de l'écart de production, qu'elles soient 
négatives ou positives. Rétrospectivement, il a maintenant été démontré que la Grande 
Dépression des années trente et la Grande Inflation des années soixante-dix ont été alimentées 
par cette croyance. La crédibilité et l'ancrage des anticipations d'inflation nécessitent que nous 
n'accordions, en matière de politique monétaire, aucun crédit à la théorie passée dite de la « pâte 
dentifrice » (une fois l’inflation « sortie du tube », une politique monétaire restrictive ne peut la 
combattre) ni, de façon symétrique, à la vision actuelle de la corde que l’on peut tirer mais pas 
pousser, (une politique accommodante ne peut donc pas lutter contre la déflation).  
Nos résultats doivent donc être jugés à moyen terme. Quinze mois seulement se sont écoulés 
depuis le véritable démarrage de l'assouplissement quantitatif dans la zone euro mais nous 
pouvons déjà constater certains effets positifs. Selon les évaluations des services de la BCE, sans 
l'APP (Asset Purchase Program – Programme d’achats d’actifs), l'inflation aurait été négative 
en 2015 et serait inférieure de plus d'un demi-point de pourcentage en 2016 et d'environ un demi-
point de pourcentage en 2017.  
Si nous poursuivons notre programme, à quoi devons-nous nous attendre à l'avenir ? La 
réserve fédérale des États-Unis nous a montré le chemin, en prenant une série de mesures très 
importantes pour accroître la relance monétaire, même après avoir ramené son taux d'intérêt 
directeur à zéro. La Fed a donné des indications sur l'orientation future de la politique monétaire 
afin de signaler une période prolongée de bas niveau des taux d'intérêt et a débuté 
l'assouplissement quantitatif. Les États-Unis ont logiquement ouvert la voie dans la mesure où ils 
ont été le premier épicentre de la Grande Récession. 
                                                     
2 C.Romer et D. Romer The Most Dangerous Idea in Federal Reserve History: Monetary Policy Doesn’t Matter, American Economic 
Review: Papers & Proceedings 2013, 103(3): 55-60. 
4 
 
L'assouplissement quantitatif a débuté en novembre 2008 aux États-Unis et l'inflation sous-
jacente a atteint son point bas en octobre 2010. Le chômage a reculé régulièrement depuis et le 
taux d'inflation s'est rapproché de 2 %, qui est la cible d'inflation fixée par la Réserve fédérale. 
C'est seulement alors que le Comité fédéral de l'open market a pu arrêter d'accroître son bilan, 
relever le taux des fonds fédéraux par rapport à son plancher et amorcer ainsi une stratégie de 
sortie. 
De toute évidence, nous ne nous situons pas, dans la zone euro, au même point du cycle 
économique, mais nous parcourons la même route s'agissant de la politique monétaire. 
 
 
5 
Certains considèrent que ces politiques non conventionnelles dans la zone euro sont 
contreproductives, parce que les taux d’intérêt ultra-bas lèsent les épargnants et les banques. 
Toutefois, nous avons effectué un suivi attentif de la rentabilité des banques et – si l’on 
prend en compte TOUS les éléments de la politique monétaire – aucun signe ne montre 
d’effets globalement négatifs du niveau des taux en 2015. En outre, le taux d’intérêt réel 
mondial à long terme baisse depuis 30 ans environ, reflétant un déséquilibre entre une forte 
volonté d’épargner et une rareté relative des agents économiques disposés à emprunter pour 
investir. Comme nous le savons tous, ce déséquilibre est particulièrement prononcé en 
Allemagne où cet excédent est de l’ordre de 8 % du PIB allemand. 
Surtout, nous ne pouvons pas fonder nos décisions sur les résultats qu’elles auraient pour 
des groupes particuliers, mais sur le bien commun. L’activité économique ne dépend pas 
seulement des épargnants, mais aussi des entrepreneurs, des travailleurs, des accédants à la 
propriété et des emprunteurs, qui bénéficient du bas niveau des taux d’intérêt. Ces politiques 
finiront par rétablir des niveaux d’inflation plus conformes à notre mandat et nécessiteront des 
taux d’intérêt plus élevés tant en termes nominaux que réels. Pour que les taux d’intérêt soient 
durablement plus élevés demain, nous devons les maintenir à des niveaux bas aujourd’hui. 
Cela étant, tous les instruments non conventionnels ne sont pas légitimes. Le niveau négatif 
des taux d’intérêt ne doit pas aller au-delà d’une certaine limite, ainsi que l’a déclaré Mario 
Draghi. Aussi, ce type de mesure non conventionnelle, bien qu’utile, doit être utilisé avec 
précaution. Et je pense que la « monnaie hélicoptère » ferait plus de mal que de bien : nous 
n’en avons pas besoin et ce n’est pas à l’ordre du jour. 
Le véritable problème est que la politique monétaire ne peut pas tout. Nous avons fait notre part, 
mais nous ne pouvons pas générer la croissance économique durable qui sous-tend la prospérité, 
y compris pour les épargnants. Pour cela, il est nécessaire que les autres responsables de la 
politique économique agissent. 
Au moment où la zone euro enregistre à la fois un écart de production négatif et un important 
excédent extérieur, c’est-à-dire un excédent d’épargne par rapport à l’investissement, nous 
devons réfléchir à la façon la plus productive d’utiliser l’abondante épargne européenne pour 
l’investissement en Europe. 
6 
 
 
C’est pourquoi nous devons favoriser un partage des risques privés plus étendu dans la zone 
euro, ce qui nécessite un cadre de financement et d’investissement plus intégré. Ainsi qu’il est 
écrit dans le rapport Fratzscher sur l’accroissement de l’investissement en Allemagne : « la clef 
d’une reprise durable en Europe est une croissance plus forte qui doit d’abord et avant tout être 
soutenue par une campagne d’investissement et de modernisation conjointe ». J’y viendrai. 
Mais nous devons également parvenir à une meilleure coordination des politiques publiques. 
À cette fin, nous devons examiner en détail le rôle concret que pourrait jouer un ministre des 
Finances de la zone euro. 
 
II – POURQUOI NOUS AVONS BESOIN D’UNE INSTITUTION CHARGÉE DE LA 
« PLEINE COORDINATION » DANS LA ZONE EURO, INCARNÉE PAR UN 
MINISTRE DES FINANCES.  
 
À l’évidence, la politique monétaire ne peut se substituer ni à la coordination des politiques 
économiques ni au manque de réformes. Ne serait-ce que pour cette raison, les banquiers 
centraux doivent prendre part au débat, même si c’est aux dirigeants politiques que revient la 
décision d’agir. C’est aussi pourquoi nous devons mettre l’accent sur la question de la 
gouvernance économique et de la coordination dans la zone euro.  
Nous sommes conscients des fortes résistances politiques au partage des ressources 
budgétaires et de la souveraineté, ainsi que de la montée de l’euroscepticisme. C’est pourquoi 
nous devons faire valoir des arguments économiques. L’enjeu ici, ce n’est pas « plus de 
Bruxelles », mais c’est très concrètement plus de croissance et d’emplois en Europe.  
7 
La crise de la zone euro a montré à quel point nous manquions de préparation. L’absence de 
coordination a en effet un vrai coût économique. Plusieurs approches font état d’un coût 
significatif de l’absence de coordination, de l’ordre de 2 à 5 % du PIB depuis la crise, et par 
conséquent de millions d’emplois.  
Pour faire avancer le débat, il faut opérer plusieurs choix fondamentaux. Premièrement, 
progresser en parallèle sur les réformes nationales et [non pas « ou »] sur la coordination 
européenne. Il s’agit là de la pierre angulaire de tout accord franco-allemand : pour être juste, 
tant l’appel français à une plus grande implication de l’Allemagne dans la coordination que les 
doutes de l’Allemagne au sujet des réformes françaises étaient et demeurent fondés. Cela 
nécessite de surmonter la méfiance réciproque et de placer ensemble ces deux aspects sous les 
auspices d’une institution commune. 
Deuxièmement, nous devons reconnaître que les «institutions avec mandat » sont plus 
efficaces que les « règles sans institutions », ainsi que l’a souligné Mario Draghi dans son 
analyse de la différence fondamentale qui existe entre une institution de politique monétaire et 
des règles budgétaires. Pour renforcer la cohérence et la coordination des politiques 
économiques, il faut reconnaître que nous avons besoin de règles plus simples. Mais elles 
doivent être complétées par des institutions fortes dotées de pouvoirs discrétionnaires.  
Troisièmement, il y a place pour un niveau intermédiaire d’intégration, illustré par une 
matrice simple : 
 
Une institution chargée de la pleine coordination 
 
Je l’appellerai « pleine coordination des politiques économiques nationales », soit le chaînon 
actuellement manquant entre intégration complète, du type de celle de la politique monétaire, et 
8 
surveillance fondée sur des règles, comme c’est actuellement le cas des politiques budgétaires 
nationales en Europe, et dont l’efficacité est clairement insuffisante. Et je ne pense pas que nous 
soyons prêts pour une véritable union budgétaire dotée d’une capacité budgétaire commune et de la 
grande confiance mutuelle qu’elle exige. 
Outre l’achèvement de l’union bancaire, le volet nécessaire de la réforme de l’UEM concerne la 
mise en place d’une institution forte afin de coordonner pleinement les politiques 
budgétaires et structurelles nationales. Cela permettrait de faire de la zone euro plus que la 
somme de ses parties. Pour reprendre une phrase célèbre de Jean Monnet, « rien ne se crée sans 
les hommes, mais rien ne dure sans les institutions ». 
L’idée d’un ministre des Finances de la zone euro n’est pas nouvelle : Marcel Fratzscher et le 
DIW, par exemple, ont récemment défendu l’idée d’un « ministre des Finances commun », 
conscients qu’une monnaie unique « requiert un processus de convergence économique et une 
coordination étroite des politiques économiques, comportant des règles communes »
3
. Mais 
laissez-moi préciser ses missions concrètes. J’en vois quatre.  
Premièrement, le ministre serait chargé de la préparation d’une stratégie collective à l’échelle 
de la zone euro pour remplir son mandat d’atteindre une croissance durable et pour 
s’accorder collectivement sur le partage des tâches via la définition d’objectifs de performances 
individuels pour les États membres. Nul ne conteste sérieusement qu’une stratégie collective 
comportant davantage de réformes structurelles dans certains pays, y compris la France, et 
davantage d’investissement public dans d’autres pays, notamment l’Allemagne, permettrait un 
meilleur dosage des politiques économiques au profit d’une croissance durable et de l’emploi en 
Europe. 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la surveillance de la mise en 
œuvre de la stratégie collective, en utilisant les instruments appropriés pour créer des 
incitations symétriques. Les incitations négatives comprendraient les mécanismes de sanction 
existants et pourraient être élargies aux procédures contractuelles déjà présentées dans le cadre 
de la contribution franco-allemande de 2013 sur l’UEM, ou dans la proposition de la Chancelière 
allemande
4
 de « contrats de réforme contraignants ». Une incitation positive serait par exemple 
l’accès à un « fonds de convergence de la zone euro », grâce auquel les États membres 
bénéficieraient d’un financement commun.  
 
Troisièmement, le ministre des Finances serait responsable de la mise en œuvre de la gestion de 
crise centralisée. Le ministre des Finances de la zone euro serait naturellement chargé du 
contrôle des opérations du Mécanisme européen de stabilité.  
 
Enfin, au fur et à mesure de l’intégration, le ministre pourrait se voir confier la gestion du fonds 
de convergence de la zone euro, évoluant progressivement vers un budget de l’euro.  
Le renforcement de l’intégration et la responsabilité démocratique devraient progresser en 
parallèle. Ces modifications institutionnelles nécessitent de toute évidence un nouveau Traité.

Premièrement, nous avons besoin d’une procédure de nomination de nature à établir 
fortement la légitimité de la fonction. Le ministre des Finances pourrait ainsi être nommé pour 
une période de cinq ans par le Conseil européen à la majorité qualifiée, sur proposition du 
président de la Commission européenne. Cette nouvelle nomination serait soumise à 
l’approbation formelle du Parlement européen, et le ministre des Finances serait membre de la 
Commission et président de l’Eurogroupe.  
 
Deuxièmement, le ministre des Finances de la zone euro devrait pouvoir s’appuyer sur un 
véritable Trésor européen. Cette administration bénéficierait également de l’expertise publique 
de deux organismes indépendants, le Conseil budgétaire européen et le Conseil de compétitivité.  
 
Enfin, si nous parvenons à mettre en œuvre une intégration plus poussée, nous aurons besoin 
d’un contrôle démocratique plus fort sur les affaires de la zone euro. À cette fin, nous 
devrons envisager d’institutionnaliser un format « zone euro » au sein du Parlement européen. 
Les relations entre les députés de la zone euro et les parlements nationaux devront également être 
renforcées. 
Comme je l’ai dit, nous ne devons pas seulement mieux coordonner les politiques publiques, 
mais également favoriser le partage du risque privé dans l’ensemble de la zone euro. Comme le 
disait Wolfgang Schaüble, les dirigeants européens doivent montrer « que l’équilibre budgétaire, 
la croissance et l’investissement ne s’excluent pas mutuellement, mais qu’ils vont plutôt de 
pair »

III. CONSTRUIRE UNE UNION DE FINANCEMENT ET D’INVESTISSEMENT 
EFFICACE POUR DEMAIN  
Nous devons améliorer le financement de l’investissement dans l’UE. Nos efforts doivent se 
concentrer sur le financement de la croissance et de l’innovation et sur le dosage approprié entre 
les solutions de financement par endettement et par émission d’actions, tout en continuant de 
préserver la stabilité financière et d’assurer la protection des consommateurs. Dans l’UE, la 
Commission européenne a lancé le Plan d’investissement, dit « plan Juncker », et l’Union des 
marchés de capitaux (UMC).  
Jusqu’à présent, ces initiatives ont produit des résultats, mais ils restent insuffisants. Une 
approche plus ambitieuse réunirait l’UMC, l’Union bancaire et le plan Juncker. C’est pourquoi je 
suggère la mise en œuvre d’une Union de financement et d’investissement. Il est essentiel de 
clarifier deux objectifs : (a) la diversification du financement des entreprises, et (b) le 
renforcement de la zone euro. Comme indiqué dans l’article co-écrit avec Jens Weidmann en 
février, cette Union de financement et d’investissement, comportant davantage de financement 
par émission d’actions, semble être le meilleur moyen pour résoudre le paradoxe d’une épargne 
abondante qui n’est pas suffisamment mobilisée au bénéfice de l’investissement.  
Premièrement, je vais me concentrer sur la diversification des modes de financement. Les 
besoins des entreprises doivent représenter le point de départ. Il convient de favoriser de 
nouveaux modes de financement de l’investissement des entreprises, une des clés de 
l’innovation. Il devrait surtout y avoir davantage de financement par émission d’actions.  
 
<U+F0B7> Fait essentiel, le financement des entreprises par émission d’actions est deux fois moins 
important en Europe qu’aux États-Unis : 52 % du PIB dans la zone euro, contre 121 % 
aux États-Unis.  
<U+F0B7> Cela est regrettable, car le financement par émission d’actions est le meilleur moyen de 
partager les risques et les opportunités, et aussi de soutenir l’innovation. La  croissance 
de nombreux marchés émergents en rattrapage peut se financer par l’endettement. Mais 
une économie à la frontière technologique, comme c’est le cas des États-Unis ou, 
espérons-le, de l’Europe, doit se financer par émission d’actions : l’innovation étant plus 
11 
risquée, l’investisseur doit avoir un « upside », un fort potentiel d’appréciation face à son 
risque. 
<U+F0B7> Selon l’enquête Innobaromètre de la Commission, le financement est le principal obstacle 
à la promotion de la R&D et de l’innovation en Europe. Que pouvons-nous faire ? Les 
politiques fiscales, entre autres, pourraient être révisées pour favoriser le financement par 
émission d’actions. Il est également impératif de développer des dispositifs innovants au 
niveau européen, comme des fonds européens de capital-risque, afin de faciliter la 
création et la croissance de nouvelles entreprises. 
De plus, une Union de financement et d’investissement sert à renforcer la zone euro. Les 
flux bancaires à court terme ont augmenté après l’introduction de l’euro, mais la crise financière 
a fait la démonstration que le canal du partage des risques via les marchés de capitaux était 
encore sous-développé dans la zone euro. La réalité de la fragmentation financière et ses 
conséquences négatives sur l’économie nous permettent de tirer une conclusion évidente : le 
financement par actions est clairement l’instrument qui permet le mieux d’atténuer les chocs 
asymétriques dans une union monétaire. Ses avantages sont multiples (Financial Integration 
Report 2016 de la BCE) : il est moins volatil que le financement par endettement et il améliore la 
capacité de résistance des entreprises à des conditions défavorables.  
 
Par exemple, le marché boursier américain, qui présente une forte intégration, est capable 
d’amortir 40 % environ d’un choc économique spécifique à un État, les bénéfices et les pertes 
d’une entreprise étant répartis entre les propriétaires sur l’ensemble du territoire américain. Dans 
la zone euro, cette forme de partage des risques est pratiquement inexistante.

En conclusion, permettez-moi de citer Robert Mundell
6
, fondateur de la théorie des zones 
monétaires optimales. Il a reconnu que la zone euro était loin d’être optimale. Il est toutefois 
resté confiant, en déclarant : « [L’Europe] y parviendra, parce qu’elle n’a pas le choix. » Une 
politique économique d’ensemble, et non la seule action des banques centrales, est effectivement 
l’unique partie à jouer.  
Nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre une énième occasion manquée : pour l’Europe, pour ses 
citoyens, 2016-2017 est le moment décisif pour agir.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et  
Président de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution 
 
Conférence de l’ACPR – Paris, 16 juin 2016  
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous pour conclure cette première 
partie de la conférence de l’ACPR. La question des nouvelles réglementations 
bancaires, qui a été explorée ce matin, suscite actuellement des inquiétudes : 
faut-il aller plus loin ? Les réglementations ne sont-elles pas un frein à la 
croissance économique ? Avant de parler de demain, parlons d’hier et 
d’aujourd’hui. Nous serons, je l’espère, tous d’accord pour reconnaître qu’il y 
avait, après la crise, une nécessité absolue de renforcer la stabilité financière. 
Et la réponse a été forte : sous l’impulsion du G20 et du Conseil de stabilité 
financière, un travail remarquable a été accompli ; il a conduit à l’adoption d’un 
ensemble complet de nouvelles réglementations, beaucoup plus exigeantes, à 
la fois au plan international avec les travaux bâlois, et en Europe. De ce fait, 
notre système bancaire est aujourd’hui beaucoup plus solide qu’avant la crise. 
Entre 2008 et 2015, les grands groupes bancaires français ont ainsi plus que 
doublé leurs fonds propres – de 132 à 275 milliards d’euros. Et, contrairement 
à ce que l’on entend parfois, le renforcement de la réglementation depuis la 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
2 
 
crise n’a pas pesé sur la croissance : personne ne peut dire sérieusement que 
l’offre de crédit en France serait aujourd’hui contrainte par les ratios 
prudentiels. Cela est dû aussi aux effets favorables de la politique monétaire 
menée par l’Eurosystème, qui a contribué à l’assouplissement des conditions 
de crédit dans la zone euro.  
** 
Demain est une autre question. Il nous faut garder le cap sur quatre priorités 
fortes : 
 
1) D’abord, la nécessité de stabiliser rapidement l’environnement 
réglementaire, sans augmentation significative de l’exigence globale de 
capital.  
Au niveau international, huit ans après la crise, il est largement temps 
de finaliser la réforme Bâle 3 d’ici la fin de l’année. Le GHOS (Gouverneurs et 
superviseurs) l’a affirmé à Bâle en janvier, le G20 des Ministres des Finances 
l’a dit à Shanghai en février, puis redit à Washington en avril : les travaux en 
cours ne doivent pas conduire à une « augmentation significative des 
exigences globales en fonds propres » imposées au système bancaire. En 
l’état, les propositions techniques actuelles du Comité de Bâle ne paraissent 
pas respecter suffisamment cet engagement : il faut donc poursuivre le 
travail ; le QIS (étude d’impact chiffrée) en cours est essentiel à cet égard. Il 
se joue là, particulièrement en Europe où le canal bancaire est majoritaire, la 
bonne transmission de la politique monétaire et le bon financement de 
l’économie. Je sais que c’est une préoccupation partagée par beaucoup de 
banquiers centraux dans la zone euro, en Europe, et hors d’Europe, comme 
de la Commission européenne et de l’ABE. La finalisation de Bâle 3 doit offrir 
au plus vite aux banques un cadre d’activité pérenne et lisible. Ce ne peut 
donc être un « Bâle 4 » – et l’abus de ce terme-choc ne sert pas toujours ses 
auteurs. Ce n’est pas à l’inverse un statu quo, banque par banque : si des 
écarts non justifiés existent dans l’emploi des modèles, il faudra les corriger 
pour assurer une comparabilité des exigences.  
Page 3 sur 6 
 
3 
 
Au niveau européen, le cadre de gestion des crises bancaires et de 
résolution a lui aussi enregistré des progrès importants. Il faut s’en féliciter, 
même si, là non plus, tout n’est pas terminé. Dans la mise en place du 
dispositif de prévention et de résolution de crise,  les banques ont leur part à 
prendre, en élaborant des plans de rétablissement adaptés à leurs activités et 
en répondant aux exigences des autorités de supervision et de résolution. Il 
est également important qu’elles se préparent aux futures exigences en 
matière de capacité d’absorption des pertes. Celles-ci vont être fixées très 
prochainement pour les plus grands groupes par le Conseil de résolution 
unique, en tenant compte du cadre international du TLAC finalisé par le G20 
en novembre dernier. Il est souhaitable que ce dernier serve de socle – sans 
« goldplating » ou surtransposition – au dispositif européen, le MREL, qui doit 
être revu d'ici la fin de l'année et qui, lui, s'applique à l'ensemble des banques 
de l'Union européenne.  
 
2) Deuxième priorité : l’importance de maintenir la sensibilité au risque 
dans le nouveau cadre réglementaire.  
La tentation est forte, chez certains, de simplifier à outrance le cadre 
réglementaire. La comparabilité est nécessaire, je l’ai dit, mais la sensibilité au 
risque doit être conservée, car c’est l’une des grandes avancées de la 
réglementation bancaire internationale. Certaines contraintes pesant sur les 
modèles internes devraient être renforcées, notamment pour les portefeuilles 
présentant des historiques de défauts peu « probants ». Renforcer ainsi 
encore la confiance dans l’approche pondérée des risques – qui est au cœur 
de Bâle 3 –, ce n’est évidemment pas revenir à l’approche « standard » : ni 
explicitement, ni implicitement par la fixation d’ « output floors » mal calibrés.   
Les travaux de Bâle ne doivent pas plus conduire à une remise en 
cause des spécificités nationales vertueuses. À cet égard, j’ai entendu les 
craintes exprimées au sujet des prêts à l’habitat. Nombre d’acteurs de la place 
s’inquiètent de l’avenir de certaines pratiques qui caractérisent notre marché 
immobilier national : les prêts à taux fixes, la sélection des emprunteurs en 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
4 
 
fonction de leur aptitude à rembourser leur dette ou encore le recours au 
cautionnement plutôt qu’à l’hypothèque. Aucune de ces bonnes pratiques ne 
doit être pénalisée par le Comité de Bâle ; ce n’est pas l’objectif de la réforme. 
La Banque de France et l’ACPR veilleront à ce que les nouvelles règles 
relatives au financement de l’habitat soient compatibles avec notre marché 
national. 
 
3) Troisième priorité, nous devons veiller à préserver un contexte 
réglementaire équitable, un level playing field international.  
L’adoption des nouvelles normes prudentielles pour le secteur bancaire 
ne doit pas être l’occasion de modifier les conditions de concurrence, de 
favoriser un modèle d’activité plutôt qu’un autre. Les règles communes doivent 
être appliquées de façon effective et convergente par les différents pays 
concernés. Et il est important que le renforcement de la réglementation porte 
de façon adaptée sur l’ensemble des intermédiaires financiers – c’est par 
exemple le sens des travaux initiés par le Conseil de stabilité financière 
concernant l’industrie de la gestion d’actifs. 
Au sein de la zone euro, la convergence du cadre réglementaire des 
banques est favorisée par le Mécanisme de Supervision Unique, à la fois 
grâce à la supervision directe par la BCE des plus grands groupes bancaires, 
via les équipes de surveillance prudentielle conjointes, et grâce au 
développement de standards de supervision communs pour les banques de 
taille moins importante. Néanmoins la complexité de la réglementation 
européenne peut être excessive pour les établissements les plus petits, 
notamment en termes d’exigences de reporting et d’application des standards 
techniques. Sur ces points-ci, des réflexions tout à fait légitimes sont 
engagées au sein de l’Union européenne pour une application plus 
proportionnée de la réglementation. Il convient cependant de veiller à 
maintenir le niveau des exigences de solvabilité et de liquidité, équitablement 
pour tous les acteurs du marché européen. Sinon l’Union européenne 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
5 
 
risquerait de créer de lourds effets de seuil, et des distorsions de concurrence 
transfrontières.  
 
4) Enfin, quatrième et dernier point d’attention : la rentabilité des 
banques, et les exigences des investisseurs.  
L’effet de la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème sur la rentabilité des 
banques de la zone euro est un sujet complexe. On tend abusivement à le 
limiter aujourd’hui aux taux négatifs. Quand on regarde ce sujet, il faut 
regarder tous les effets. La baisse des taux courts et l’aplatissement de la 
courbe des taux ont certes réduit la marge nette d’intérêt des banques. Mais 
l’accroissement des volumes de crédit est venu partiellement compenser cet 
effet. La baisse de la charge du risque, favorisée notamment par la politique 
monétaire, joue aussi positivement. De plus, les banques ont bénéficié d’une 
réduction sensible du coût de leurs émissions de dette, y compris via le 
TLTRO-II décidé en mars et appliqué à partir du 22 juin prochain : sous 
condition de croissance suffisante des encours de prêts à l’économie réelle (+ 
2,5 % au total sur deux ans), ce TLTRO-II sera lui-même de fait à taux négatif.  
Dans la durée, des banques rentables et solides sont bien sûr un 
élément essentiel à la pleine efficacité de la politique monétaire. Cela étant, 
dans l’environnement actuel de taux bas, la baisse du taux de financement 
sans risque devrait normalement engendrer une baisse des exigences des 
investisseurs en ce qui concerne le rendement des capitaux engagés dans les 
banques (« cost of equity »). Pourtant, ce n’est pas – ou pas suffisamment – 
ce que l’on constate. C’est une contradiction que la stabilisation souhaitée du 
cadre réglementaire en cours de finalisation devrait contribuer en partie à 
corriger : des banques plus solides – elles le sont déjà –, aux résultats plus 
comparables, sorties des incertitudes réglementaires récurrentes, devraient en 
toute logique voir baisser le coût de leurs fonds propres.

La finalisation de l’agenda « post-crise » est une étape  majeure, tant pour les 
banques que pour la communauté des superviseurs. Tout doit être fait pour 
que cela se fasse dans l’esprit souhaité par le GHOS et le G20 - les autorités 
françaises, comme beaucoup d’autorités européennes et internationales, sont 
vigilantes à cet égard. Il est important, aussi, que la Profession fasse sa part 
du chemin en se préparant dès maintenant aux nouvelles évolutions qui se 
dessinent. C’est à cette double condition – action vigilante des régulateurs et 
superviseurs, et préparation active des banques – que nous pourrons, 
ensemble, aboutir à un cadre réglementaire de confiance, au service du 
financement de l’économie. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Colloque du conseil scientifique de l’AMF 
« L’éducation financière à l’ère du digital » 
Paris, le 20 juin 2016 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de répondre ce matin à l’invitation de l’AMF et de son 
président, Gérard Rameix, pour parler de la question de l’éducation financière. 
Maîtriser les notions économiques et financières de base est loin d’être une 
simple exigence théorique. Chaque individu est amené, au quotidien, à 
prendre des décisions financières, qu’il s’agisse de consommer, d’acquérir un 
logement ou encore de préparer sa retraite. L’éducation financière doit 
permettre à chacun de faire des choix éclairés. Elle est indispensable plus 
encore dans un monde digital. Les nouvelles technologies multiplient en effet 
les opportunités pour le consommateur, en matière de paiement, de 
financement – le crowdfunding – ou encore d’investissement – les « robo- 
advisors » –, mais elles ne sont pas exemptes de risques. Mieux comprendre, 
pour mieux décider, c’est là tout l’enjeu de l’éducation financière aujourd’hui. 
Elle est un facteur d’efficacité économique et d’équité sociale – ce sera mon 
premier point. Et c’est la raison pour laquelle les pouvoirs publics ont engagé 
des actions concrètes pour la faire progresser – j’y reviendrai ensuite.  
 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
I. D’abord, l’éducation économique et financière comme facteur 
d’efficacité pour le financement de l’économie, et d’équité sociale 
 
1) La France a des lacunes en matière d’éducation économique et 
financière des ménages. Des études menées à la Banque de France
1
, sur la 
base des travaux académiques de Lusardi et Mitchell, montrent qu’en France, 
moins d’un individu sur trois est capable de ne pas faire d’erreurs sur des 
questions financières de base – le calcul des intérêts, l’effet de l’inflation sur 
l’épargne et le caractère plus ou moins risqué des produits financiers. Cette 
faible proportion est comparable à celle observée aux États-Unis, mais elle est 
nettement inférieure aux résultats de certains de nos voisins : au moins une 
personne sur deux répond correctement en Allemagne et en Suisse. En outre, 
en France, ces lacunes touchent particulièrement les jeunes : selon l’enquête 
PISA, près de 20 % des élèves de quinze ans n’atteignent pas le niveau de 
compétence de base en culture financière ; c’est plus que la moyenne des 
pays de l’OCDE évalués
2
.  
2) Une meilleure éducation économique et financière des Français est 
primordiale, à la fois pour l’équité sociale et pour le bon fonctionnement 
de l’économie :  
- L’éducation financière contribue à une meilleure intégration sociale, car elle 
limite les risques de surendettement et d’exclusion financière. Elle permet 
aussi de corriger les différences qui existent entre les catégories de 
population. De nombreuses études, comme par exemple celle menée par 
le Comité consultatif du secteur financier en 2014
3
, montrent en effet que 
les revenus, l’âge, le sexe, la structure familiale, le niveau d’éducation 
générale ou encore la classe sociale sont autant de facteurs qui jouent 
dans l’accès aux connaissances économiques et financières : les hommes, 
                                                          
1
 Arrondel et al. 2013 et 2015.  
2
 15,3 % en moyenne dans les 13 pays évalués contre 19,4 % en France. 
3
 De même, l’étude PISA montre que l’écart de performance des élèves français suivant leur groupe socio-
économique est particulièrement marqué. 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
d’âge moyen, plus éduqués, ont généralement un meilleur niveau 
d’éducation financière que les autres catégories de population.  
- De plus, l’éducation financière participe au bon fonctionnement de 
l’économie, car elle favorise une meilleure orientation de l’épargne des 
ménages. Les travaux académiques
4
 montrent que les individus les plus 
éduqués financièrement sont les plus à même de planifier sur le long 
terme, ce qui est crucial dans un contexte de vieillissement de la population 
et de réforme des systèmes publics de retraite. Ils sont aussi les plus 
enclins à détenir des actions, ce qui est vital pour notre économie : pour 
innover, nos entreprises ont en effet besoin de trouver davantage de 
financements par fonds propres.   
 
II. Pour faire progresser l’éducation financière en France, quel rôle pour 
les pouvoirs publics ?  
1) L’éducation financière, un engagement fort de la Banque de France. 
La Banque de France, comme l’ACPR et l’AMF, ont une expérience concrète 
et quotidienne des besoins d’information et d’explication de nos concitoyens. 
Avec 780 000 consultations de notre site internet commun Assurance-banque-
épargne info-services (ABEIS) et 340 000 appels téléphoniques reçus au 
numéro d’appel unique associé en 2015, nous répondons tous les jours aux 
questions pratiques des clients sur les produits qu’ils ont souscrits ou 
s’apprêtent à souscrire. La Banque de France a d’ailleurs fait depuis 
longtemps de l’éducation économique et financière du public un objectif 
stratégique, dans le cadre de sa responsabilité sociétale. Elle dispose grâce à 
son réseau d’une couverture de l’ensemble du territoire et mène déjà des 
actions par le biais d’ateliers pédagogiques, d’expositions, de son site internet 
Citéco ou encore de la Cité de l’Économie et de la Monnaie qui doit ouvrir à 
Paris en 2018.   
                                                          
4
 Notamment Americks et al. (2003),  Arrondel et al. (2013) et (2015). 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Fin avril, la Banque de France a été désignée par le Ministre des Finances 
comme opérateur de la stratégie nationale d’éducation financière de la 
population. Cette stratégie nationale est un engagement fort des pouvoirs 
publics, qui s’inscrit dans le prolongement des principes élaborés par l’OCDE 
et adoptés par le G20 en 2012.  Dans ce rôle d’opérateur national, la Banque 
de France ne sera pas soliste, mais chef d’orchestre. Elle veillera, en 
coordination étroite avec l’AMF, à l’association de toutes les parties prenantes, 
notamment les acteurs déjà fortement impliqués dans ce domaine, comme 
l’Institut pour l’éducation financière du public avec le site internet « La finance 
pour tous ». Notre objectif collectif sera si j’ose dire un cube à trois 
dimensions : toucher tous les publics – les jeunes bien sûr, les personnes en 
situation de fragilité financière aussi, les enseignants et les étudiants, mais 
plus généralement tous les citoyens à chaque moment de leur vie –, de traiter 
tous les sujets qui s’y rattachent – l’éducation financière, mais aussi 
budgétaire, et les questions économiques et monétaires – et d’utiliser tous les 
supports pertinents pour diffuser largement ces connaissances – sites internet, 
actions de terrain, partenariats avec les autres services publics – en premier 
lieu l’Éducation nationale – et les associations. 
2) Former, informer, mais aussi réguler.  
L’éducation financière est indispensable dans un monde digital, qui donne plus 
d’autonomie aux consommateurs. Mais elle ne suffit pas à elle seule à les 
protéger. L’ACPR et l’AMF agissent donc aussi en tant que régulateurs. Pour 
accompagner le développement du digital, au bénéfice de tous, nous marions 
ensemble l’ancien et le nouveau : l’ancien, c’est notre expertise commune sur 
la protection du consommateur ; le nouveau, ce sont nos orientations sur la 
finance digitale, avec une coopération renforcée dans ce domaine et la 
création d’un pôle commun sur les Fintech. Nous réunirons d’ailleurs, avec 
Gérard Rameix, le premier Forum Fintech le 18 juillet prochain. 
L’autonomie des consommateurs face au digital n’existe en effet réellement 
que si elle est garantie tout au long du parcours client par une information et 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
un conseil adaptés, à la fois en termes de contenu, de cohérence et de 
chronologie. En outre, il faut veiller à ce qu’en amont de son choix, le client ne 
soit pas profondément influencé (via internet ou les réseaux sociaux), parfois 
même à son insu. Les contrôles menés par l’ACPR et les visites mystère 
conduites par l’AMF, ainsi que les travaux communs, montrent que tel n’est 
pas encore toujours le cas. De même, le sujet des données doit faire l’objet 
d’une attention particulière à la fois en raison des enjeux de sécurité qu’il 
comporte, mais également en termes d’information des consommateurs sur 
l’utilisation de leurs données personnelles. Tout ceci nous amène à un 
principe d’évidence : les Français doivent être aussi bien protégés sur le digital 
que sur la finance traditionnelle. C’est d’ailleurs la condition sine qua non de la 
confiance, et donc de la croissance du digital.  
** 
Je voudrais conclure mon propos ce matin avec l’aide de Paul Valéry (Variété 
III) : « L'éducation ne se borne pas à l'enfance et à l'adolescence. 
L'enseignement ne se limite pas à l'école. Toute la vie, notre milieu est notre 
éducation, et un éducateur à la fois sévère et dangereux. » S’il est vrai que 
l’éducation – notamment financière – se joue tout au long de la vie, l’ambition 
de la Banque de France, avec l’ACPR et l’AMF, sera au contraire d’être un 
éducateur bienveillant, mais un régulateur attentif. À l’ère digitale, il est 
impératif de faire avancer ensemble l’éducation financière et la régulation, 
pour permettre le développement de nouvelles technologies, comprises par 
tous et au bénéfice de tous. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence : « Rétablissement et résolution des contreparties centrales »  
Paris, 24 juin 2016 (Banque de France) 
 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Je ne ferai pas de commentaires sur le résultat du référendum britannique. Soyez 
seulement assurés que nous sommes mobilisés et déterminés. 
 
* 
 
En France, l’histoire des contreparties centrales est déjà relativement ancienne. La 
Caisse de liquidation, établie au Havre, a été la première à offrir, en 1882, une 
assurance contre le risque de contrepartie sur les marchés de matières premières. 
Cela explique notre rôle traditionnel d’autorité de surveillance des contreparties 
centrales ; de là vient également l’intérêt particulier que nous portons à cette 
question et notre engagement à contribuer au débat dans ce domaine. J’aimerais 
vous dire quelques mots à ce sujet. Compte tenu de l’importance croissante des 
contreparties centrales pour les marchés financiers et la stabilité financière, 
nous avons la responsabilité collective, partagée entre le secteur financier et 
les régulateurs, de maintenir un réseau solide de contreparties centrales. 
Convaincus du rôle essentiel des contreparties centrales, nous devons 
garantir qu’elles ne deviennent jamais les prochaines institutions « trop 
importantes pour faire faillite » (too big to fail).  
 
* 
 
2 
 
L’importance croissante des contreparties centrales est liée aux évolutions 
réglementaires, mais pas seulement. Elle tient également à la 
désintermédiation financière et aux modifications du comportement des 
intervenants de marché, deux évolutions particulièrement bienvenues. 
Les évolutions réglementaires et l’agenda de Pittsburgh ont été, à l’évidence, 
des facteurs essentiels contribuant à l’importance systémique des contreparties 
centrales. Toutefois, l’obligation de compensation pour les dérivés de gré à gré ne 
marque pas la fin de l’histoire.  
En effet, la tendance à la désintermédiation est un autre facteur puissant, qui 
pourrait encore amplifier le rôle des contreparties centrales. Cette tendance à la 
désintermédiation est encouragée par des initiatives publiques, comme l’Union des 
marchés de capitaux soutenue par la Commission européenne dans l’UE. Ce 
mouvement est également lié à des initiatives de marché, notamment au niveau de 
notre place financière, ici à Paris, visant à promouvoir le financement de marché en 
complément du crédit bancaire : par exemple, l’ESNI (Euro Secured Note Issuer) 
permet la titrisation de créances privées de très haute qualité afin d’améliorer le 
financement des PME.  
Nous observons également une appétence croissante des intervenants de 
marché pour la compensation centrale avec comme objectif de sécuriser 
davantage leurs transactions. Les opérations de pensions livrées sont de plus en 
plus compensées auprès de contreparties centrales dans l’UE et cela a joué un rôle 
clé dans la robustesse affichée par le marché européen des pensions livrées au 
cours des dernières années. 
Toutefois, l’accroissement de l’importance systémique s’accompagne de 
responsabilités plus grandes.  
* 
 
Ces responsabilités croissantes incombent au premier chef au secteur lui-
même.  
3 
 
Le secteur de la compensation doit avoir une organisation cohérente et 
robuste. Nous ne devons pas céder à la tentation de maximiser les effets de 
compensation.  
Nous sommes tous d’avis que la compensation centrale a pour objectif 
principal de réduire le risque systémique. Les contreparties centrales ne peuvent 
être considérées avant tout comme des outils permettant d’améliorer l’efficience 
opérationnelle et en matière de fonds propres. Elles doivent également accroître la 
stabilité financière. Le projet de fusion entre le London Stock Exchange Group et la 
Deutsche Börse pourrait être une illustration pertinente du risque d’un arbitrage entre 
ces deux objectifs. Comme je l’ai déjà indiqué, nous suivrons donc attentivement ce 
projet du point de vue de la stabilité financière. 
Le secteur doit aussi implanter les contreparties centrales dans la zone monétaire 
appropriée, en vue d’améliorer la gestion du risque de liquidité, ce qui est essentiel 
pour la capacité de résistance des contreparties centrales.  
Les membres compensateurs doivent également piloter la gestion des risques des 
contreparties centrales vers l’adoption des meilleures pratiques. Leur participation à 
la gouvernance des contreparties centrales est essentielle à cet égard. Elle devrait 
se traduire par des retours d’information réguliers sur la méthodologie et les résultats 
des tests de résistance des contreparties centrales, qui devraient être communiqués 
aux participants. 
S’agissant des régulateurs et des autorités de surveillance, la priorité est 
d’améliorer en permanence la robustesse des contreparties centrales, en s’appuyant 
sur les Principes pour les infrastructures des marchés financiers définis par le CPIM 
et l’OICV. Nous devons éviter l’arbitrage réglementaire et la concurrence qui s’exerce 
via la réduction des exigences prudentielles. Cela signifie une harmonisation plus 
stricte au niveau international des exigences applicables aux contreparties 
centrales. À cet égard, je salue les importants travaux que réalisent actuellement le 
CPIM et l’OICV en vue de proposer des orientations plus granulaires et de piloter les 
contreparties centrales vers l’adoption des meilleures pratiques. Il s’agit notamment 
de l’alignement des incitations entre les acteurs du marché afin d’améliorer la 
gestion du risque. Une illustration en est donnée par la promotion de l’inclusion d’une 
part dédiée du capital (« skin in the game ») des contreparties centrales dans le 
4 
 
mécanisme d’allocation des pertes en cas de défaut, qui aligne les incitations des 
actionnaires de la contrepartie centrale sur celles des membres compensateurs. Les 
contreparties centrales devraient aussi être soumises à des tests de résistance 
prudentiels fréquents, ce qui permettrait de  rassurer quant à leur robustesse. Cela 
créerait une mesure externe objective garantissant le caractère approprié et la 
cohérence de leurs procédures de gestion des risques. Ces pratiques doivent être 
développées pour évaluer la gestion du risque de crédit mais également du risque de 
liquidité, qui est trop souvent ignoré. 
 
* 
Enfin, permettez-moi de dire encore quelques mots d’introduction sur le sujet précis 
de cette conférence. Comme vous le savez, les règlements requièrent des 
contreparties centrales qu’elles envisagent tous les scénarios extrêmes mais 
plausibles dans leur gestion quotidienne du risque. Toutefois, nous ne pouvons pas 
ignorer le risque de perte extrême. La moindre possibilité que les ressources de la 
contrepartie centrale puissent être épuisées dans une crise doit trouver une solution 
adaptée. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous avons besoin de dispositifs de 
rétablissement et de résolution robustes pour les contreparties centrales, afin de 
préserver la stabilité financière en toutes circonstances. 
Avant de vous laisser le soin d’examiner cette question complexe, j’aimerais vous 
faire part de quelques réflexions : 
- Le principe fondateur de la résolution est toujours la stabilité financière : 
elle doit être obtenue en assurant la continuité des services de la contrepartie 
centrale si cela est possible, mais en aucun cas aux dépens de la survie 
financière des membres et des clients de la contrepartie centrale. 
- Le coût permanent d’un tel régime doit être évalué soigneusement afin de 
préserver les incitations en faveur d’une compensation centrale. Les 
contreparties centrales ont déjà des ressources financières correctement 
dimensionnées et un modèle d’activité sain, qui doivent être préservés. 
- Les dispositifs de résolution doivent trouver le juste équilibre entre 
prévisibilité pour les participants à la contrepartie centrale et flexibilité 
pour les autorités de résolution, dont la mission consistant à préserver la 
5 
 
stabilité financière dans les circonstances les plus extrêmes ne doit pas être 
perturbée. 
- Et enfin, la coopération entre les autorités et la cohérence au niveau 
international sont essentielles pour garantir l’efficacité de la planification de la 
résolution et des mesures de résolution, et pour éviter des failles dans la 
réglementation et les arbitrages réglementaires. Cette conférence témoigne 
véritablement de la volonté de renforcer la coopération internationale dans ce 
domaine.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention. Je vous souhaite une conférence très 
fructueuse.

Conférence Handelsblatt, 31 août  2016, Francfort 
François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Quelle politique monétaire et quel système bancaire pour une Europe de 
croissance et de stabilité ? 
 
Je suis ravi d’être parmi vous cet après-midi, ici à Francfort, à la fois au 
milieu des banques allemandes et au cœur de l’Eurosystème. Même si ces 
deux parties ne sont pas toujours d’accord, nous partageons tous une même 
conviction : l’Europe a besoin de davantage de croissance durable, et toutes 
les politiques économiques doivent contribuer à cet objectif ; et la politique 
monétaire ne peut pas et ne doit pas porter tout le fardeau, même si 
malheureusement ceci tente actuellement trop de gouvernements.  
Pour les banquiers centraux et les régulateurs, ceci signifie deux 
impératifs : la stabilité monétaire et la stabilité financière. Les deux ont des 
conséquences significatives sur l’économie réelle. La stabilité monétaire – ou 
stabilité des prix –, réduit les incertitudes et les coûts pour les agents 
économiques. La stabilité financière – et en particulier celle des banques –, 
permet d’assurer l’allocation de l’épargne vers les investissements profitables 
sans défaillances graves. Ces deux impératifs se renforcent mutuellement : la 
stabilité des prix limite les chocs susceptibles d’affecter la valeur réelle des 
actifs ; la stabilité financière permet la bonne transmission de la politique 
monétaire. Cependant, l’une ne garantit pas l’autre. Il suffit de se rappeler que 
les déséquilibres financiers qui ont mené à la grave crise de 2008 se sont 
constitués dans une période de grande stabilité des prix. C’est pourquoi nous 
2 
 
travaillons résolument à ces deux objectifs. Je vais les détailler chacun, puis 
revenir sur leurs interactions.  
 
I. La stabilité des prix, d’abord : notre politique monétaire y est conforme  
Je suis tout à fait conscient que la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème 
suscite de vifs débats en Allemagne. Mais contrairement à ce que suggèrent 
certains critiques, ce n’est pas une fantaisie latine incontrôlée. Nous la 
décidons de façon collective au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs, pour 
assurer la stabilité des prix, c’est-à-dire une inflation ni trop forte, ni trop faible. 
Une inflation trop forte aurait des conséquences désastreuses sur l’économie 
– l’histoire de l’Allemagne en témoigne ; une inflation trop faible nous 
exposerait au danger mortel de la déflation, les années 1930 l’ont hélas 
montré. La stabilité des prix est l’objectif prioritaire que nous confie le Traité de 
l’Union européenne ; nous avons le devoir de nous y consacrer.  
En pratique, elle a été définie comme un taux d’inflation à moyen terme 
proche de, mais inférieur à 2 %. Cette définition est partagée par les grandes 
banques centrales des pays développés. [Slide 2] Dans la zone euro, nous 
avons connu une période de remarquable stabilité des prix jusqu’à la crise. À 
partir de 2012 cependant, l’inflation est passée nettement sous la barre des 2 
% et les anticipations d’inflation ont baissé. Notre mandat nous imposait de 
réagir. Après d’autres banques centrales, nous menons donc depuis 2014 une 
politique monétaire « non conventionnelle ». Nous la menons résolument, 
mais avec prudence : prudence dans le choix des instruments – certains, 
comme la monnaie hélicoptère, ne sont pas légitimes et d’autres, comme les 
taux d’intérêt négatifs, sont utiles mais ne sont qu’un instrument parmi 
beaucoup d’autres et ont leurs limites. Prudence aussi quant aux 
répercussions éventuelles sur la stabilité financière, j’y reviendrai.  
Notre politique monétaire produit des résultats tangibles au service des 
économies de la zone euro. Plusieurs études le montrent, dont une récente de 
la Bundesbank. [Slide 3] Selon la fourchette basse de leurs estimations, le 
programme d’achats d’actifs (APP) de janvier 2015 a contribué à la croissance 
3 
 
du PIB à hauteur de + 0,5 pp en 2015 et en 2016, et fait augmenter l’IPCH, qui 
permet de mesurer l’inflation, de + 0,2 pp en 2015 et + 0,3 pp en 2016 ; 
encore que ces chiffres n’incluent pas l’effet de nos mesures de décembre 
2015 et de mars 2016. D’autres analyses conduisent d’ailleurs à des résultats 
encore plus élevés.  
Beaucoup d’épargnants allemands s’inquiètent de l’effet des taux d’intérêt 
bas sur leur épargne. [Slide 4] En réalité, il est important de distinguer les taux 
nominaux – ceux qui sont affichés –, des taux réels – ceux qui déterminent ce 
que leur rapporte vraiment leur épargne, une fois déduite l’inflation. Et 
précisément, les taux d’intérêts réels sont aujourd’hui bien plus profitables aux 
épargnants allemands qu’ils ne l’étaient entre 2011 et 2013. La meilleure 
façon de retrouver des taux nominaux durablement plus élevés, ce sera 
d’avoir retrouvé une trajectoire d’inflation faiblement positive, et pour cela 
d’être persévérants dans notre politique monétaire actuelle.  
 
II. La stabilité des banques, ensuite : ce que nous avons déjà fait  
En tant que régulateurs, nous agissons par ailleurs pour garantir la stabilité 
financière. De grands progrès ont été réalisés depuis la crise, avec : i) une 
réglementation prudentielle renforcée, grâce à la réforme Bâle 3 ; ii) un 
contrôle des banques plus intégré, avec le mécanisme de supervision unique 
des banques de la zone euro, et, en amont, un état des lieux complet des 
bilans bancaires, l’Asset Quality Review en 2014.  
 En conséquence, la résilience du système bancaire de la zone euro a 
augmenté. Ainsi, entre fin 2013 et fin 2015, les banques européennes ont 
accru leurs fonds propres CET1 de 180 milliards d’euros, ce qui leur permet 
de mieux faire face aux situations de stress éventuelles, comme l’a montré le 
résultat du dernier stress test de l’ABE, meilleur que le précédent mené en 
2014. En France en particulier [Slide 5], le système bancaire est nettement 
plus solide qu’avant la crise : le ratio de solvabilité CET1 des grands groupes 
bancaires a plus que doublé, de 5,8 % en 2008 à 12 % en 2015, soit plus que 
l’ensemble des banques suivies par le Comité de Bâle (11,5 %). Les réserves 
4 
 
de liquidité ont augmenté de 359 milliards d’euros depuis fin 2011 alors que 
l’endettement de marché à court terme a baissé. Les taux de prêts non 
performants restent bas, à 4 %. Enfin, la rentabilité est résiliente, avec un ROE 
de 7 % en moyenne en 2015 pour les 4 banques françaises cotées, contre 5,8 
% pour les banques significatives de la zone euro.  
 
III. J’en viens maintenant aux interactions entre ces deux objectifs 
1) Dans certains cas, des tensions peuvent survenir  
Nous sommes particulièrement attentifs aux effets de notre politique monétaire 
accommodante sur :  
- La rentabilité des banques. Cette question doit être abordée dans toutes 
ses composantes. Certes, la baisse des taux et l’aplatissement de la 
courbe réduisent la marge nette d’intérêt des banques. Toutefois, il y a 
également des effets positifs qu’il ne faut pas oublier : grâce à la politique 
monétaire, le volume des crédits est reparti à la hausse ; des plus-values 
en capital significatives ont été enregistrées ; le coût du risque a diminué 
avec l’augmentation de la solvabilité des emprunteurs ; et le coût de 
refinancement des banques sur les marchés a baissé. De plus, dans le 
cadre des mesures TLTRO-II, nous mettons à disposition des banques des 
lignes de crédit sécurisées à taux très favorables. Des estimations de la 
BCE [Slide 6] montrent que nos mesures récentes de politique monétaire 
ont un impact net positif sur la rentabilité des banques, pour la période 
2014-2017. Toutefois, en dynamique pour l’avenir, nous devons être 
attentifs à l’effet des taux négatifs sur la rentabilité des banques. 
- Le prix des actifs et le risque de bulles. Nous surveillons de près le 
système, les acteurs et les marchés financiers. La dernière Financial 
Stability Review de la BCE, notamment, l’a confirmé : [Slide 7] actuellement 
il n’y a pas signes de déséquilibres généralisés sur les prix des actifs, ni sur 
les actions, ni sur les prix de l’immobilier. Ainsi, si l’on observe [graphique 
de droite] l’évolution conjointe des prix immobiliers et du crédit à 
l’immobilier, qui sont au cœur de la formation de bulles spéculatives, la 
5 
 
situation actuelle ne montre pas de dynamique déstabilisatrice, ni en 
France, ni en Allemagne puisque ces deux pays se situent dans la phase 
basse de leur cycle financier (les courbes bleue et rouge sont en effet 
inférieures à leur moyenne historique représentée par l’axe des abscisses). 
Cela étant, pour rester efficace, chaque politique doit rester concentrée sur 
son objectif propre : la stabilité monétaire doit être assurée par la politique 
monétaire ; la stabilité financière par la politique macroprudentielle et la 
surveillance microprudentielle des différents acteurs. Et heureusement, nous 
disposons d’instruments différents pour atteindre ces objectifs.   
 
2) Il y a néanmoins des convergences souhaitables  
Premièrement, un système bancaire solide et intégré est nécessaire à la 
bonne transmission de nos mesures de politique monétaire – Mario Draghi l’a 
rappelé en juillet dernier lors de sa dernière conférence de presse. Pour 
préserver le bon fonctionnement du canal bancaire, il faut avancer dans trois 
directions. D’abord, il faut lever l’incertitude réglementaire en finalisant Bâle 3 
d’ici la fin de l’année 2016. Le GHOS et le G20 l’ont dit clairement : cela doit 
se faire sans « augmentation significative des exigences globales en fonds 
propres ». Ensuite, il faut traiter le problème des prêts non performants de 
certaines banques européennes. Enfin, il faut permettre davantage de 
consolidation transfrontière des banques au sein de la zone euro. Dans le 
cadre de l’union bancaire, des banques plus largement multidomestiques, 
pourront mieux diversifier leurs risques au sein de la zone euro, et mieux y 
faire circuler l’épargne à travers les frontières. Je suis conscient que ceci 
suppose un affinement des réglementations actuelles.  
  Deuxièmement, les déséquilibres économiques dans la zone euro doivent 
être réglés. La politique monétaire n’est en effet pas la véritable cause des 
taux très bas que nous observons. Plus fondamentalement, ils sont le 
symptôme de l’insuffisance d’investissement par rapport à l’épargne : la zone 
euro a un excédent courant sous-optimal, à plus de 3 % du PIB. Et plutôt que 
de réduire l’épargne, notre objectif doit être de développer l’investissement, 
6 
 
avec des réformes structurelles favorables. Cela passe aussi par la 
construction d’une véritable « Union de financement et d’investissement ». 
Cette union devra rassembler les initiatives existantes qui contribuent à 
stimuler l’investissement – le plan Juncker, l’Union des marchés de capitaux, 
l’Union bancaire – mais elle devra aussi aller plus loin en créant des synergies 
pour atteindre deux objectifs clairs : [Slide 9] d’une part, la diversification du 
financement des entreprises, pour répondre à leurs besoins. L’investissement 
innovant doit pouvoir être davantage financé par les fonds propres. Dans ce 
domaine, l’Europe est en très retard : le financement des entreprises par fonds 
propres y est deux fois plus faible qu’aux États-Unis (52 % du PIB contre 121 
%). D’autre part, l’augmentation de la résilience de la zone euro grâce à des 
marchés de capitaux intégrés. Comme je l’ai écrit avec Jens Weidmann en 
février 2016, cette forme de partage des risques privés est le  meilleur moyen 
d’atténuer les chocs asymétriques dans une union monétaire.  
 
* 
Pour conclure, laissez-moi citer Hans Tietmeyer, qui fut président de la 
Bundesbank et dont on vient de fêter le 85
ème
 anniversaire. Lui qui a vécu la 
naissance de l’euro, nous disait dès 19971, en anglais : « […] a stable euro is 
more like a valuable treasure buried in a field. At present, some work is still 
needed to uncover it. And it will require further energy to guard the euro’s 
stability on a lasting basis. » Et il ajoute : « That is why the architects of 
monetary union must not forget that monetary stability is a perpetual 
challenge. » Ses mots sont toujours d’actualité. La stabilité est pour nous à la 
fois un bien précieux et un défi permanent, qui nous oblige à agir. Face aux 
enjeux du moment – le risque de déflation et le trop faible investissement – 
nous ne pouvons pas nous enfermer dans l’inaction, précisément parce que la 
stabilité est notre but, et une condition essentielle de notre croissance.

Forum des décideurs économiques régionaux 
16 septembre 2016  - Espace conférence, salle 2 
Discours introductif de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de 
France 
 
Monsieur le Ministre, 
Mesdames et Messieurs les vice-présidents, 
Mesdames et Messieurs les conseillers régionaux, 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je suis heureux de vous accueillir à la Banque de France pour cette deuxième édition du forum 
des décideurs économiques régionaux. La première édition a eu lieu il y a un an, presque jour pour 
jour, dans le contexte immédiat de la promulgation de la loi de réforme territoriale, la loi NOTRe. 
Depuis un an, les nouvelles régions sont devenues réalité, la Banque de France s’y est adaptée 
rapidement pour répondre toujours mieux aux attentes de tous les acteurs économiques. Mais ses trois 
grandes missions sont réaffirmées, ce sont les 3S : la Stratégie monétaire, avec notre participation 
active à la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème ; la Stabilité financière, avec la supervision des 
banques et des assureurs qui s’est beaucoup renforcée après la crise ; et la mission qui nous intéresse 
plus particulièrement aujourd’hui, le Service à l’économie, en faveur des ménages, des entreprises et 
des collectivités publiques. Ces trois missions se renforcent mutuellement : la Banque de France a 
cette chance d’avoir la tête en Europe, mais les pieds sur le terrain. Je veux vous dire très 
concrètement comment : ce que nous faisons déjà, et ce que nous voulons faire en plus avec vous.  
*** 
 
1) Quelques mots d’abord sur l’adaptation de la Banque de France à la nouvelle organisation 
territoriale issue de la loi NOTRe.  
 
Notre réseau de succursales est désormais structuré autour de 13 directeurs régionaux qui sont 
naturellement présents à vos côtés, ce matin comme le reste de l’année. Nos directeurs régionaux ont 
mobilisé leurs équipes et leurs données pour que les services de la Banque de France soient calqués, le 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
 
plus rapidement possible, sur les nouveaux périmètres régionaux : il en va ainsi par exemple des 
travaux de conjoncture, qui donnent désormais lieu à des publications sur la base des nouvelles 
régions, qu’il s’agisse de notre suivi mensuel – avec Tendances Régionales – ou annuel – avec 
l’Enquête Rapide de Fin d’Année Régionale.  
 
2) Dans ce nouveau cadre, nous renforçons notre mission de service économique à la collectivité.  
 
a) S’agissant des ménages d’abord, la Banque de France reste au cœur de la gestion des grands 
fichiers, de l’exercice du droit au compte ou encore du traitement des situations de surendettement – 
nous œuvrons pour la simplification de la procédure, avec la suppression de l’homologation par le juge 
d’instance des mesures d’effacement de dettes et la concentration de la phase de négociation amiable 
sur les situations dans lesquelles un bien immobilier est en jeu. Nous nous préparons également à 
exercer la nouvelle mission qui nous a été confiée par l’État : l’éducation économique et financière des 
publics, en tant qu’opérateur national. Le premier Comité stratégique se tiendra à Bercy lundi. 
 
b) J’en viens maintenant plus en détail aux actions que nous menons pour répondre au mieux 
aux besoins des entreprises et des Conseils régionaux. Cela passe par plusieurs dispositifs :  
 
Premièrement, la mise en place d’un correspondant TPE dans chaque succursale départementale de 
la Banque de France d’ici la fin de ce mois de septembre. Nous avons en effet constaté que les TPE 
avaient souvent besoin d’un accompagnement plus adapté à leur situation. La médiation du crédit joue 
un rôle très efficace, en aval, d’aide à la résolution des problèmes financiers. En 2015, elle a contribué 
à préserver plus de 18 000 emplois. Mais il importe aussi et surtout, en amont, de chercher à prévenir 
les difficultés. Le correspondant TPE, un expert de la Banque de France dans chaque département, 
sera chargé d’accueillir et d’écouter les dirigeants de TPE en qualité de tiers de confiance, et de les 
orienter vers le réseau ou le service professionnel adapté à leurs besoins. En pratique, les dirigeants de 
TPE pourront le contacter directement par téléphone, via un numéro vert qui sera prochainement 
communiqué, par messagerie ou encore en se déplaçant dans nos succursales.  
 
Deuxièmement, des outils d’analyse personnalisés pour les entreprises : 
- Nous proposons depuis plusieurs années aux PME ainsi qu’aux ETI la prestation GEODE. Elle 
leur permet de s’appuyer sur un expert de la Banque de France pour piloter leur développement 
tout en maitrisant leurs risques, grâce à un diagnostic complet de leur situation et à des prévisions 
détaillées.  
- Pour que les outils d’analyse et de simulation de la Banque de France puissent bénéficier au plus 
grand nombre d’entreprises – y compris aux TPE –, nous avons décidé de lancer à partir de 
décembre 2016 le service en ligne OPALE (pour Outil de Positionnement et d’Analyse en Ligne 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
 
des Entreprises). Il sera dans un premier temps ouvert aux entreprises dont nous disposons des 
comptes, c’est-à-dire celles dont le chiffre d’affaires atteint au moins 750 K€. Une extension est 
prévue, courant 2017, à celles d’une taille inférieure, dès lors qu’elles établissent des liasses 
fiscales dites « normales ». Nous avons souhaité que le prix de ce nouveau service reste modique, 
avec des formules qui s’échelonneront entre 200 et 500 €. Grâce à OPALE, les dirigeants de PME 
et TPE pourront ainsi disposer, dans un langage courant, d’une comparaison des performances et de 
la situation financières de leur entreprise au regard de celles de leur secteur d’activité. Ils pourront 
compléter cette analyse par une simulation de leurs évolutions sur la base de différentes hypothèses 
de gestion.  
 
Troisièmement, pour les Conseils régionaux, des services adaptés pour accompagner la mise en 
œuvre de leurs nouvelles compétences économiques :  
- D’une part, comme devrait nous le permettre le projet de loi Sapin en cours de discussion, nous 
nous préparons à vous ouvrir l’accès à notre base de données FIBEN (Fichier InterBancaire sur les 
Entreprises), dans les mêmes conditions de confidentialité que les banques et les autres acteurs du 
financement des entreprises qui y ont déjà recours. FIBEN est une base unique en Europe et 
probablement dans le monde de par l’ampleur des informations qu’elle contient sur les entreprises 
et les groupes. Elle couvre plus de 7 millions d’entités, y compris les entrepreneurs individuels, 
parmi lesquels figurent les 250 000 entreprises cotées par la Banque de France. Cet outil pourra 
vous aider à instruire les demandes d’aides publiques des entreprises et suivre, dans la durée, 
l’impact de votre soutien financier sur leur développement.  
- D’autre part, nous avons adapté notre prestation d’analyse du tissu économique des territoires, dite 
ACSEL (Analyse Conjoncturelle et Structurelle de l’Économie Locale), en développant un 
véritable service sur mesure, ajusté en fonction de vos attentes et de vos besoins. Elle permet par 
exemple d’établir un diagnostic de territoire par comparaison avec une ou plusieurs autres régions, 
ou de réaliser des analyses approfondies sur certaines catégories d’entreprises ou certaines filières 
professionnelles, comme l’aéronautique. Les services ACSEL peuvent naturellement être déployés 
sous la forme d’un partenariat dans la durée entre votre Conseil régional et la Banque de France.  
- Certains élus travaillent d’ailleurs avec nos directeurs régionaux pour bâtir une coopération plus 
complète encore, autour d’un partenariat global combinant l’accès à FIBEN et à la cotation 
Banque de France, le recours à d’ACSEL, et le subventionnement de l’accès à GEODE pour les 
entreprises. Je vous invite, si vous êtes intéressés, à vous rapprocher de votre directeur régional de 
la Banque de France. Je le dis clairement, nous sommes prêts à signer des « conventions de 
service » globales et innovantes avec les régions qui le souhaiteront : ce forum annuel est aussi 
l’occasion de nous faire part de toutes vos attentes.

Je voudrais terminer par un exemple concret de ce que pourraient être nos préoccupations 
communes en matière de développement des territoires, avec la question suivante : comment 
développer la capacité exportatrice des entreprises de nos régions, pour augmenter leur rayonnement 
international ? Matthias Fekl, Secrétaire d’État chargé du commerce extérieur, qui nous fait l’honneur 
de conclure cette matinée, reviendra certainement sur cette question. C’est en tout cas un point 
d’intérêt constant de la Banque de France qui, comme vous le savez, établit la Balance des paiements 
pour la France. Il existe un potentiel certain de développement : il passe globalement par la 
compétitivité de notre pays, et individuellement par la compétitivité de chacune de nos entreprises. 
Dans ce domaine, nos directeurs régionaux sont à votre disposition pour mobiliser nos données et nos 
experts afin de vous aider à poser un diagnostic et à suivre dans la durée l’efficacité de vos actions de 
soutien à l’export.  
Sans plus tarder, je cède la parole à Claude Piot, directeur des entreprises à la Banque de 
France, pour débuter cette matinée, et vous souhaite, Mesdames, Messieurs, un excellent Forum 2016.

Première conférence annuelle du CERS – 23 septembre 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
 gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 « Le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt et  
ses conséquences pour la stabilité financière » 
 
 
La question des conséquences du bas niveau des taux d’intérêt pour la 
stabilité financière est un sujet complexe. Il est d’autant plus ardu qu’il y a une 
confusion grandissante dans le débat public quant à la signification de 
l’expression « taux bas ». Lorsque les gens parlent de taux bas, ils les 
confondent souvent avec les taux directeurs négatifs des banques centrales 
ou avec l’aplatissement de la courbe des rendements. Mais il s’agit là de 
concepts différents. L’expression « taux bas » elle-même présente de 
multiples facettes et recouvre des réalités différentes. Avant de parler des 
conséquences pour la stabilité financière, je souhaiterais commencer par ces 
questions : qu’entendons-nous par « taux bas » et quelles en sont les 
causes ?  
 
A. Qu’entendons-nous par « taux bas » ?  
Commençons par la référence la plus commune : les taux d’intérêt 
nominaux. La crise financière de 2007-2008 a clairement créé une rupture, 
avec la chute brutale des taux nominaux à court terme, d’abord aux États-Unis 
puis dans la zone euro, ceux-ci étant revenus de plus de 5 % à un niveau 
proche de 0 % en un cours laps de temps ; les taux nominaux à long terme ont 
diminué plus progressivement. Ces évolutions reflètent les réponses 
Page 2 sur 8 
 
 
apportées à la crise par les banques centrales : elles ont dû réduire les taux 
d’intérêt pour stimuler l’économie et ramener l’inflation sur une trajectoire plus 
satisfaisante. Pour ce faire, l’Eurosystème a adopté un ensemble exhaustif de 
mesures de politique monétaire : la baisse des taux directeurs a réduit les taux 
d’intérêt du marché monétaire ; les indications fournies sur la trajectoire future 
des taux (forward guidance) ont suscité des anticipations relatives aux taux 
futurs à court terme, ce qui a aplati l’ensemble de la courbe des rendements ; 
le programme d’achats d’actifs a comprimé les primes de risque, et cette 
réduction s’est propagée aux différentes classes d’actifs et à l’ensemble des 
échéances par des effets de rééquilibrage des portefeuilles. 
S’agissant des taux d’intérêt réels, la tendance observée après la crise 
financière est moins marquée, même si les taux à court et à long terme ont 
également baissé, tant aux États-Unis que dans la zone euro. Mais, point plus 
important, si nous remontons un peu plus loin en arrière, les taux réels ont 
fortement fluctué au cours de la période – ils ont même déjà été négatifs dans 
le passé, et ils ont culminé dans les années quatre-vingt et quatre-vingt-dix. 
Cependant, on ne voit pas clairement quelle est la période faisant exception : 
est-ce la situation actuelle de taux bas ou l’épisode de taux élevés des années 
quatre-vingt et quatre-vingt-dix ? Quoi qu’il en soit, la tendance générale 
depuis les années quatre-vingt est à une baisse des taux réels, plus encore en 
ce qui concerne les taux à long terme. Cela est conforme aux estimations d’un 
taux d’intérêt réel « naturel » ou « d’équilibre », qui peut être défini comme le 
taux d’intérêt réel compatible avec le plein emploi des facteurs de production 
et une inflation stable. Bien que ce concept fasse débat, il existe un large 
consensus sur le fait que le taux naturel a baissé pour s’inscrire à de très bas 
niveaux au cours des dernières décennies dans la plupart des économies 
avancées. Compte tenu de ces évolutions fondamentales, il serait 
déraisonnable de tabler sur une remontée des taux jusqu’aux niveaux des 
années quatre-vingt et quatre-vingt-dix dans un avenir proche.

B. Ces évolutions conduisent à formuler deux conclusions 
provisoires. 
Premièrement, les taux d’intérêt nominaux sont probablement proches 
désormais de leur point bas, ce qui n’implique pas qu’ils vont remonter bientôt. 
La BCE a réduit l’un de ses taux directeurs jusqu’à le rendre négatif ; les taux 
négatifs sont un élément utile de notre boîte à outils, mais ils ont 
manifestement des limites. Nous savons qu’il y a une borne inférieure, même 
si nous ignorons où elle se situe exactement : quelque part légèrement en 
dessous de zéro. Toutefois, le rythme d’une éventuelle hausse des taux 
d’intérêt nominaux dépendra de la vitesse à laquelle l’inflation se rapproche de 
son objectif, elle-même liée notamment à l’orientation accommodante de notre 
politique monétaire et à la reprise économique au sens large. La BCE a 
énoncé clairement que les taux directeurs resteraient à leurs niveaux actuels 
ou à des niveaux plus bas sur la durée nécessaire. Elle ne sera en mesure de 
normaliser les taux directeurs que si elle les maintient à de bas niveaux aussi 
longtemps que nécessaire pour faire remonter l’inflation. C’est le paradoxe 
apparent souligné par Mario Draghi : « un bas niveau des taux d’intérêt 
aujourd’hui conduira à des taux plus élevés demain »1.  
Deuxièmement, il y a davantage d’incertitude sur les taux d’intérêt 
réels, car, à long terme, ils résultent essentiellement de facteurs non 
monétaires : ils reflètent les fondamentaux propres à l’économie. L’excès de 
l’épargne par rapport à l’investissement est largement connu sous l’appellation 
de « savings glut » (surabondance d’épargne) : pourtant, il serait plus exact – 
et plus parlant – de le qualifier d’« investment dearth » (pénurie 
d’investissement). Quoi qu’il en soit, ce phénomène exerce des pressions à la 
baisse sur les taux réels. S’agissant de certains pays d’Asie de l’Est et de la 
zone euro, l’écart entre épargne et investissement est en effet 
extraordinairement important : en 2015, l’excédent du compte courant 
s’établissait à 3 % environ du PIB dans la zone euro, atteignant 8,5 % du PIB 
en Allemagne et 9,1 % aux Pays-Bas. Des taux d’intérêt réels à long terme

plus élevés nécessitent de procéder à un rééquilibrage structurel entre 
épargne et investissement, et d’encourager clairement l’investissement plutôt 
que de réduire l’épargne. Cela suppose des réformes structurelles, ainsi que 
des actions coordonnées au niveau de la zone euro pour relancer 
l’investissement.  
Dans ce contexte, à quel genre d’environnement économique les 
institutions financières peuvent-elles s’attendre ? À court terme, les taux 
d’intérêt demeureront bas et la courbe des rendements restera plutôt plate. À 
plus long terme, l’inflation remontant, les taux nominaux devraient très 
probablement augmenter de nouveau, plus fortement - ou moins lentement - 
que les taux réels. En outre, avec le redémarrage de l’inflation, la pente de la 
courbe des rendements devrait s’accentuer, les marchés anticipant une 
nouvelle hausse des taux d’intérêt futurs. C’est essentiel car ce qui compte 
pour la rentabilité des banques ce sont les taux nominaux, pas les taux réels, 
ainsi que la pente de la courbe des rendements.  
 
C. Quelles sont, pour l’heure, les conséquences pour la stabilité 
financière ?  
Il existe actuellement deux sujets de préoccupation, même si l’environnement 
économique doit s’améliorer par la suite, comme je viens de l’indiquer :  
- premièrement, la baisse de la rentabilité des institutions financières. 
Les sociétés d’assurance et les fonds de pension, qui ont un important 
stock de garanties à taux fixe, souffrent du creusement de l’écart entre les 
niveaux élevés des taux d’intérêt servis sur les engagements et la faiblesse 
des taux auxquels sont réinvestis les titres arrivant à échéance et les 
intérêts. S’agissant des banques, la réduction des taux d’intérêt et 
l’aplatissement de la courbe des rendements compriment leurs marges 
nettes. Toutefois, la politique monétaire a également eu des effets 
compensateurs : les volumes de prêt ont augmenté de nouveau, les 
banques ont enregistré d’importantes plus-values, le coût du risque a 
baissé en raison de l’amélioration de la solvabilité des emprunteurs, le coût 
Page 5 sur 8 
 
 
de financement y compris celui du financement de marché est devenu plus 
faible, et notre programme TLTRO-II (targeted longer-term refinancing 
operations) leur a donné accès à des lignes de crédits pluri-annuelles 
sécurisées à des taux extrêmement favorables. Le fort tirage enregistré lors 
de la TLTRO de septembre démontre sa force de frappe, qui avait été 
sous-estimée par de nombreux analystes. Dans l’ensemble, les estimations 
de la BCE font état d’une incidence nette positive des récentes mesures de 
politique monétaire sur la rentabilité des banques pour la période 2014-
2017. Toutefois, nous devons être vigilants à l’avenir quant à l’impact de 
faibles taux d’intérêt sur la rentabilité des banques. 
- deuxièmement, la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt pourrait également entraîner 
une prise de risque excessive. Au CERS et à la BCE, nous suivons de 
près le système financier, ses participants et ses marchés, et nous 
sommes attentifs au moindre signe de déséquilibre général des prix des 
actifs, notamment pour ce qui concerne les actions ou l’immobilier. Nous 
n’observons pas actuellement de tendances déstabilisatrices généralisées, 
mais nous nous tenons prêts à intervenir si nécessaire en utilisant des 
instruments macroprudentiels dédiés.  
 
La situation appelle deux réactions, l’une des institutions financières, l’autre 
des autorités de surveillance : 
- premièrement, les institutions financières doivent ajuster leurs 
modèles d’activité (business models). L’enjeu pour leur rentabilité est 
probablement moins une période future et de très longue durée de taux 
nominaux très bas, que la période présente qui cumule taux bas, 
innovations digitales et réglementation. Chacune de ces trois évolutions est 
fondée et gérable : mais leur concomitance crée incontestablement un 
grand défi. De nombreuses institutions financières, françaises notamment, 
ont démarré leur processus d’adaptation. S’agissant des sociétés 
d’assurance, les priorités sont de passer de modèles d’activité fondés sur 
des contrats à rendement garanti vers des modèles fondés sur des contrats 
Page 6 sur 8 
 
 
en unités de compte, et d’abaisser progressivement les rendements des 
placements en assurance vie sans risque. Pour ce qui concerne les 
banques, le développement des opérations non fondées sur les taux 
d’intérêt et l’accroissement  de la diversification permettraient de réduire 
leur vulnérabilité à la contraction de la marge d’intérêt nette. Plus 
généralement, des améliorations en termes d’efficience sont requises 
lorsque les coefficients d’exploitation sont élevés. Et, à l’évidence, une 
structure financière solide est primordiale. À cet égard, les marchés 
devraient mieux faire la distinction entre le tableau global au niveau 
européen et certains cas spécifiques. Le tableau global au niveau 
européen est celui d’une plus grande solidité depuis la crise. Depuis 2012 
le ratio CET1 des institutions importantes de la zone euro est passé de 9 % 
à 13 %. Mais des difficultés subsistent avec certaines banques, s’agissant 
des créances douteuses en Italie et au Portugal par exemple. Il faut 
désormais s’attaquer sérieusement à ces problèmes mais ils sont gérables 
s’ils sont pris à temps, comme l’illustre l’expérience de l’Irlande ou de 
l’Espagne. Dans le cadre d'un système bancaire européen plus robuste, il 
ne faut pas craindre les consolidations transfrontières qui sont la réponse 
logique à la situation de surcapacité du secteur bancaire (overbanking) 
décrite par Mario Draghi. 
- et deuxièmement, les superviseurs doivent adapter la manière dont ils 
contrôlent les banques et les sociétés d’assurance. En France, 
plusieurs mesures ont déjà été prises. S’agissant des sociétés 
d’assurance, l’ACPR a exercé individuellement une pression prudentielle 
sur les assureurs pour les inciter à tenir compte de l’environnement actuel. 
En ce qui concerne les banques, le risque associé au modèle d’activité et à 
la rentabilité est devenu, en 2016, une priorité prudentielle du Mécanisme 
de surveillance unique (MSU) et fait partie intégrante du Processus annuel 
de surveillance et d’évaluation prudentielle (Supervisory Review and 
Evaluation Process - SREP). De plus, l’ACPR évalue régulièrement au sein 
du MSU les critères d’octroi des crédits afin d’éviter une détérioration 
Page 7 sur 8 
 
 
excessive de la qualité des expositions des banques et jusqu’à présent, 
ces mesures se sont révélées satisfaisantes. L’autorité macroprudentielle 
française, le HCSF (Haut Conseil de stabilité financière), joue également 
pleinement son rôle. Par exemple, il suit attentivement le secteur de 
l’immobilier commercial ; il a annoncé récemment qu’il était prêt à activer 
des instruments macroprudentiels si nécessaire. Enfin, et surtout, en tant 
que régulateurs, nous devons évidemment stabiliser les règles - finalement, 
huit ans après Lehman. Ce faisant, nous devons éviter de surcharger les 
banques européennes, qui ont sensiblement renforcé la qualité et la 
quantité de leurs fonds propres et qui sont actuellement confrontées au défi 
de la rentabilité. À cet égard, l’engagement du G20 et du GHOS (Groupe 
des gouverneurs de banque centrale et des responsables du contrôle 
bancaire) de finaliser Bâle III sans augmentation significative des 
exigences globales en fonds propres est primordial. Accroître les fonds 
propres c’est accroître la stabilité financière, mais seulement jusqu’à un 
certain point ; si cela implique des contraintes excessives pour les 
banques, une transmission moins efficace de notre politique monétaire 
active et, par conséquent, moins de croissance, cela s’avèrerait alors 
contreproductif.  
 
En conclusion, dans le contexte actuel, notre objectif ne doit pas être de 
calmer la douleur, qu’est censée être l’environnement de taux d’intérêt 
nominaux bas, mais plutôt d’éliminer la maladie, qui est une inflation trop 
faible. Notre engagement en tant que banquiers centraux est de préserver la 
stabilité des prix. Nos mesures de relance monétaire soutiennent la demande, 
afin que l’inflation revienne à son objectif à moyen terme et, qu’à leur tour, les 
taux directeurs retrouvent des niveaux plus élevés. Mais la politique monétaire 
ne peut pas remédier aux déséquilibres structurels qui sont à l’origine du faible 
niveau global des taux d’intérêt réels : la combinaison actuelle d’un excès 
d’épargne et d’une pénurie d’investissement. D’autres politiques, qui soient 
Page 8 sur 8 
 
 
coordonnées, doivent intervenir pour relever ce défi, tandis que celles 
consacrées à la stabilité financière doivent maintenir une vigilance constante.

Audition devant la Commission des affaires économiques et monétaires 
du Parlement européen – 28 septembre 2016  
François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
 
Monsieur le Président, 
Mesdames et Messieurs les Députés, 
 
Je vous remercie de m’accueillir dans cette enceinte, qui incarne la 
démocratie européenne. Je tenais à venir dialoguer avec vous dès ma 
première année de mandat. Je parle en outre devant vous deux jours après 
Mario Draghi. Je vais me concentrer en introduction sur un sujet qui nous est 
cher : l’avenir de l’Europe ; et, comme banquier central, je veux aborder cette 
question sous l’angle économique.  
 
L’Europe actuellement ne va pas bien, en tout cas pas aussi bien qu’elle 
le pourrait. Huit ans après la crise, ses performances économiques restent 
décevantes. La reprise se confirme, mais elle est trop lente : même si les bons 
résultats de certains pays montrent qu’il n’y a aucune fatalité en Europe, la 
croissance plafonne globalement. Cela a des conséquences concrètes : le 
fléau du chômage continue de toucher plus de 21 millions de personnes ; 16 
millions pour la seule zone euro. À cela s’ajoute un euroscepticisme croissant : 
la victoire du « Brexit » en a été l’emblème, même si elle a aussi des causes 
spécifiquement britanniques. Trop souvent, l’Union européenne n’est plus 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
perçue par ses citoyens comme une solution, mais comme un problème de 
plus face aux difficultés que nous avons à gérer. Et nous voyons nos 
divergences plus que nos convergences. 
Pourtant, je crois que nous devons plus que jamais garder la fierté de 
notre identité européenne. Notre identité, c’est plus que notre histoire 
exemplaire de réconciliation, plus que la richesse de notre diversité. Notre 
identité commune, c’est un modèle social unique, qui combine un haut niveau 
de service public, et des inégalités relativement faibles – nettement moins 
fortes que dans la société américaine. Et ceci au sein d’une économie de 
marché : oui, la marque de l’Europe, c’est une économie sociale de marché. A 
l’heure où le sort des laissés-pour-compte de la mondialisation inquiète un peu 
partout dans le monde, ce n’est pas le moment de lâcher notre modèle 
commun, de baisser notre drapeau européen.  
Mais cette ambition doit être lucide. Affirmer notre modèle social passe 
non par l’immobilisme, mais par une confiance retrouvée, et une croissance 
plus forte. Dans le domaine économique, ceci veut dire partir de nos deux 
atouts, et en tirer enfin le plein potentiel par trois projets.  
 
Nous avons deux atouts majeurs en Europe :  
- Nous avons construit un grand marché unique. C’est un formidable 
actif qui nous appartient collectivement. Ce n’est pas pour rien que 
l’accès au marché unique est au cœur des débats qui entourent le 
« Brexit ». Nous ne pouvons pas préjuger du résultat des négociations 
qui vont avoir lieu, mais l’accès au marché unique doit continuer à aller 
de pair avec le respect strict de toutes les règles habituelles de l'Union 
européenne : il ne peut pas y avoir d’Europe « à la carte » (cherry-
picking), ni de « passager clandestin » (free-riding).  
- Nous avons aussi construit une monnaie solide, l’euro, reconnue dans 
le monde entier. Les citoyens de la zone euro y sont très 
majoritairement attachés (à 68 %). Au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs 
de la BCE, nous prenons très au sérieux le devoir qui nous a été confié 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
par le Traité de l’Union européenne : assurer la stabilité des prix, c’est-
à-dire, en pratique, une inflation ni trop forte, ni trop faible, qui était le 
plus grand danger ces dernières années. Dans un monde d’incertitudes, 
la politique monétaire européenne est aujourd’hui un repère de stabilité. 
Et elle produit des résultats tangibles : soutien de la demande – pour 0,3 
à 0,5 % par an –, et de l’inflation – nous devrions dépasser 1 % début 
2017, et être à 1,6 % d’inflation en 2018. Mais si nous avons réussi 
l’Union monétaire, il reste beaucoup à faire pour l’Union économique. Et 
pour cette raison même, nous avons utilisé activement la politique 
monétaire, mais nous ne l’avons pas assez relayée par d’autres 
politiques économiques. 
 
À partir de ces deux atouts, l’Europe de la croissance doit à mon sens 
avancer selon trois projets concrets, trois étapes :  
 
Première étape : l’Europe a besoin, dès maintenant, de ce que je 
préfère appeler une véritable « Union de financement et d’investissement » 
(UFI), plutôt que seulement une « Union des marchés de capitaux ». 
Pourquoi ? Car il y a aujourd’hui encore en Europe des entreprises qui veulent 
investir et innover, mais qui ne trouvent pas les financements adaptés. 
Pourtant, les ressources ne manquent pas : dans la zone euro, l’excédent 
courant, qui est une mesure de l’écart entre épargne et investissement, 
représente plus de 3 % du PIB. C’est considérable. On parle parfois de 
surabondance d’épargne (savings glut) pour qualifier ce phénomène. Je crois 
qu’il est plus juste de parler de pénurie d’investissement (investment dearth), 
car la solution pour combler l’écart entre les deux n’est pas de réduire 
l’épargne ; la solution est au contraire d’accroître l’investissement productif. 
L’insuffisance de l’investissement identifiée lors du lancement du plan Juncker 
reste en effet à peu près aujourd’hui de l’ordre de 2 % du PIB. 
Pour bâtir cette UFI, il faut prendre appui sur les initiatives qui existent 
déjà : l’Union des marchés de capitaux bien sûr, mais aussi le Plan Juncker et 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
l’Union bancaire. Et il faut non seulement les additionner, mais en démultiplier 
l’impact par des synergies croisées. Il s’agit de mobiliser toutes les énergies – 
aujourd’hui trop cloisonnées entre Commission, BEI, voire BCE – dans la 
même direction : un grand marché européen de l’épargne et de 
l’investissement. Dans ce nouveau cadre, l’Europe pourra mener des actions 
plus ambitieuses. Je citerai deux exemples. D’abord, pour les entreprises : 
qu’elles aient la possibilité de se financer davantage par fonds propres plutôt 
que par endettement. Les fonds propres sont en effet le meilleur moyen de 
financer l’innovation, plus risquée par nature. L’Europe est en retard dans ce 
domaine : la part des fonds propres des entreprises représente 52 % du PIB 
en zone euro contre 121 % aux États-Unis, soit moins de la moitié. En 
pratique, cela implique notamment l’harmonisation des régimes de faillite des 
entreprises, et une information financière plus large et plus standardisée sur 
les PME. Deuxième action, sur le secteur financier : il faut permettre 
davantage de consolidations transfrontières au sein de la zone euro. Des 
banques plus largement européennes pourront mieux accompagner l’épargne 
au-delà des frontières nationales. Et pour réduire le lien excessif entre dette 
souveraine et secteur bancaire domestique, une solution pourrait être la 
création d’obligations synthétiques de haute qualité, à l’échelle de la zone euro 
(« European safe bonds »), à partir d’un portefeuille diversifié de titres de dette 
souveraine émis par les États membres. Ceux-ci resteraient seuls 
responsables de leurs émissions de dette et de leurs remboursements. 
 
La deuxième étape pour la zone euro, c’est une stratégie économique 
collective. Quand chaque État agit de façon isolée, nous nous retrouvons 
inexorablement dans une situation sous-optimale pour tous. Nous nous 
accusons mutuellement d’être coupables des déficits au Sud, et des 
excédents au Nord… et du coup nos politiques économiques restent 
bloquées. Elles deviennent même otages de postures politiques 
simplificatrices. Mais la réponse ne passe pas par un stimulus 
budgétaire général, comme une mode récente semble le dire. Nous savons à 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
l’inverse que la croissance et l’emploi seraient plus forts en Europe avec une 
stratégie économique différenciée, qui combinerait davantage de réformes 
structurelles là où elles sont nécessaires, comme en France ; et davantage de 
soutien budgétaire là où des marges de manœuvre existent, comme en 
Allemagne. En pratique, pour que cette coordination existe, la zone euro a 
besoin d’une institution de confiance, qui incarne et qui fasse vivre 
l’engagement commun des États. Cette institution de confiance pourrait être 
un « Ministre des Finances », membre de la Commission et président de 
l’Eurogroupe, appuyé sur un Trésor européen. Il veillerait à la préparation de 
la stratégie collective, qui serait ratifiée par le Parlement européen, et à sa 
mise en œuvre par chaque pays. Il se verrait confier la gestion du MES 
(Mécanisme européen de stabilité) renforcé. Comme cette étape nécessite de 
changer les Traités, elle ne peut raisonnablement venir qu’après les élections 
qui doivent avoir lieu l’année prochaine dans plusieurs pays de la zone euro. 
 
Enfin, la troisième et dernière étape serait l’achèvement de l’Union 
économique et monétaire grâce à une capacité budgétaire européenne. Elle 
suppose préalablement des progrès de la confiance entre États membres, 
pour ne pas être ressenti comme une « Union de transferts » à sens unique.  
Un vrai budget de l’euro serait un outil de stabilisation incluant par exemple un 
niveau européen d’assurance chômage. Il pourrait être aussi un outil de 
financement de certains «  biens publics européens », comme le numérique, la 
transition énergétique ou l’intégration des réfugiés. À terme, ce budget de 
l’euro aurait la capacité directe de lever des impôts et d’émettre une dette 
commune. 
 
Pour conclure, c’est en tant que banquier central et Européen convaincu 
que je vous ai présenté mes convictions pour l’avenir de l’Europe. Comme 
banquier central, la décision ne m’appartient bien sûr pas. La responsabilité 
qui est la mienne est de contribuer au sein de l’Eurosystème à une politique 
monétaire conforme au mandat qui nous a été confié, et de faire des 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
propositions pour que les autres politiques économiques soient plus efficaces, 
et plus complémentaires. Car la politique monétaire ne peut pas tout faire ; les 
fondateurs de l’euro n’ont d’ailleurs jamais caché que d’autres étapes seraient 
nécessaires. Je les ai esquissées devant vous, et je serai heureux de 
répondre maintenant à vos questions.

 Conférence internationale de l’assurance :  
« Vers l’assurance de demain » – Paris, 14 octobre 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Président de l’Autorité de 
contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être ici aujourd’hui pour cette huitième conférence 
internationale de l’assurance : la première sous l’égide de la Fédération 
Française de l’Assurance, dont je salue chaleureusement le Président, 
Bernard Spitz, et les Vice-Présidents. Même si je vous ai souvent rencontrés 
depuis un an, c’est ma première participation également comme Président de 
l’ACPR, l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution. Soyez sûrs qu’à ce 
titre, le secteur de l’assurance est pour moi, pour nous, aussi cher et important 
que celui des banques. Avec 826 organismes recensés en France en 2015, le 
contrôle du secteur de l’assurance représente une part très importante de 
notre mission de stabilité financière – aux côtés des deux autres missions qui 
m’occupent comme Gouverneur de la Banque de France, la stratégie 
monétaire et le service à l’économie.  
 
Page 2 sur 7 
En tant que superviseurs, nous sommes mobilisés au quotidien par le thème 
de cette journée : l’assurance de demain. À vrai dire, la rapidité des évolutions 
en fait déjà largement l’assurance d’aujourd’hui. Parmi ces multiples 
changements auxquels vous devez vous adapter au mieux – technologiques, 
environnementaux, macroéconomiques ou encore réglementaires – je veux 
aborder plus particulièrement deux enjeux : l’environnement de taux d’intérêt 
bas persistants, et l’évolution profonde du cadre réglementaire avec l’entrée 
en application de Solvabilité 2.  
** 
 
I. D’abord, l’enjeu des taux bas 
 
Sur ce sujet, il est important de ne pas perdre de vue la perspective générale : 
les taux bas ne tiennent pas qu’à la politique monétaire, ils tiennent aussi à 
l’excédent global d’épargne ; et l’environnement actuel de taux d’intérêt bas 
n’a pas que des effets négatifs. Il produit aussi des bénéfices, qui ne doivent 
pas être sous-estimés. Si la BCE n’avait pas agi en faisant baisser les taux 
d’intérêt, il y aurait aujourd’hui moins d’inflation, avec le risque mortel de la 
déflation, et moins de croissance en France et en Europe. Ceci pénaliserait les 
assureurs comme les banques. En outre, les taux bas se traduisent aussi par 
des effets positifs directs sur le bilan des assureurs : les plus-values latentes 
sur les titres achetés par le passé ont fortement augmenté. Elles représentent 
au total 271 milliards d’euros en 20151. 
 
Le fait que cet environnement de taux bas soit persistant nécessite néanmoins, 
bien sûr, une vigilance des autorités de régulation, et une adaptation du 
                                                     
1 ACPR, Les chiffres du marché français de la banque et de l’assurance 2015, octobre 2016. Il s’agit des plus-values latentes de 
l’ensemble des organismes (y compris mutuelles et institutions de prévoyance), et sur l’ensemble des classes d’actifs. Les plus-
values latentes obligataires des organismes du code des assurances s’élèvent en 2015 à 151 Mds €. 
Page 3 sur 7 
secteur de l’assurance. C’est particulièrement le cas dans le domaine de 
l’assurance-vie, le placement phare en France, avec un encours moyen par 
habitant de plus de 24 000 euros. Le contexte de taux bas exerce une 
pression sur la rentabilité des organismes : il conduit à une situation où les 
rendements des titres entrant en portefeuille sont inférieurs aux taux servis sur 
les polices d’assurance. Pour y faire face, les organismes d’assurance se sont 
d’ores et déjà engagés dans la baisse des taux servis aux assurés : ils ont été 
réduits en moyenne de 25 points de base en 2015 par rapport à l’année 
précédente. Cependant, cette baisse reste encore insuffisante, en 
comparaison notamment avec la baisse du rendement des OAT 10 ans : 
- 80 points de base sur la même période. J’appelle donc de nouveau les 
organismes à faire preuve de modération et de réalisme dans la fixation des 
taux de rendement de leurs contrats d’assurance-vie en euros sur l’année 
2016. 
 
Au-delà, l’environnement de taux bas pose une question de fond sur la 
diversification des produits d’épargne. L’année 2015 a été marquée par une 
réorientation des assurés vers les produits en unités de compte : la collecte 
nette a presque doublé par rapport à l’année précédente, pour atteindre 
11,4 milliards d’euros, alors qu’elle a diminué de près de 25 % sur les supports 
en euro, à 10,5 milliards2. Toutefois, les contrats en unités de compte ne sont 
sans doute pas la seule réponse à apporter, d’autant que leur essor ne peut 
aller sans une grande exigence de qualité de l’information financière, afin que 
les assurés soient pleinement conscients des risques associés.  
 
Nous devons donc collectivement – pouvoirs publics et professionnels – 
poursuivre notre réflexion en matière de réorientation de l’épargne des 
Français. Sans en faire nécessairement un enjeu du débat électoral des 
                                                     
2 ACPR, Les chiffres du marché français de la banque et de l’assurance 2015, octobre 2016. 
Page 4 sur 7 
prochains mois, la réponse peut viser une triple compatibilité : avec 
l’environnement de taux bas, avec une meilleure allocation des ressources 
vers le financement de l’investissement productif – et donc les fonds propres 
des entreprises –, et avec les attentes des épargnants. Compte tenu de 
l’allongement de la durée de vie, et de la volonté de préparer leur retraite, les 
épargnants adoptent en effet de plus en plus un horizon de long terme : ils 
sont davantage attachés à la sécurité de leurs placements qu’à leur liquidité. 
Selon la voie ouverte par Euro-croissance, il y a donc un sens à proposer aux 
épargnants, à titre complémentaire, de nouveaux produits d’épargne, moins 
liquides, assortis d’une forme de protection du capital sur le long terme, et 
pouvant bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions sur la durée. Et il faut à 
tout le moins éviter les distorsions fiscales au détriment de ces produits par 
rapport à l’épargne liquide et sans risque. 
 
Dans l’environnement de taux bas, l’ACPR veille à ce que les organismes 
d’assurance restent vigilants face aux risques d’évolutions défavorables et 
prennent les mesures nécessaires pour les contrer. C’est pourquoi, dans le 
cadre de l’exercice 2015 de préparation à l’évaluation interne des risques 
(ORSA), elle a demandé aux assureurs d’analyser de façon approfondie 
l’impact de scénarios d’environnement de taux bas prolongé sur leur 
solvabilité, l’équilibre de leur situation financière et le respect de leurs 
engagements. De plus, l’EIOPA mène cette année un stress test à l’échelle 
européenne. Pour la France, le périmètre de l’exercice est particulièrement 
large : l’ACPR l’a étendu pour qu’il couvre 90 % du marché, contre 75 % 
attendus par l’EIOPA. Contrairement aux stress tests bancaires, les stress-
tests assurantiels ne sont pas « fail or pass » et ne donneront donc pas lieu à 
des exigences de capital supplémentaires. Les résultats qui seront publiés 
d’ici mi-décembre globalement permettront de déterminer avec précision 
l’exposition du marché assurantiel aux risques liés à l’environnement de taux 
bas. L’exercice ORSA, comme les stress-tests en cours, permettent à l’ACPR 
Page 5 sur 7 
de cibler les éventuelles vulnérabilités et nous entendons bien en 
conséquence discuter avec les établissements concernés des mesures à 
mettre en œuvre pour y remédier.  
 
Enfin, il y a la proposition, dans le cadre du projet de loi Sapin, d’étendre les 
pouvoirs de l’autorité macroprudentielle française, le HCSF, au secteur de 
l’assurance. La polémique sur ce sujet est inutile, en fait contre-productive 
pour la protection des assurés. Je vous le dis avec fermeté : il n'y a aucune 
menace sur l'épargne des Français, aucune remise en cause des contrats des 
assurés ; bien au contraire, notre responsabilité, après la crise que nous 
avons traversée, est de protéger au mieux les droits des assurés, de tous les 
assurés. L'unique objectif de cette mesure est de pouvoir protéger l’épargne 
des Français, en cas de circonstances graves et exceptionnelles menaçant la 
stabilité financière. Si cela devait s'avérer nécessaire, nous saurions en faire 
bon usage, dans l'intérêt de tous.   
 
II. Deuxième grand enjeu pour le secteur de l’assurance : la profonde 
évolution du cadre réglementaire 
 
La directive Solvabilité 2 est entrée en application dans l’Union européenne au 
1
er
 janvier de cette année, après dix années de négociation difficile. Malgré ce 
que disent certains critiques, cette refonte du cadre de régulation était 
nécessaire. Le cadre antérieur, qui datait des années 1970, n’était plus adapté. 
Il ne prenait pas en compte la vraie nature des risques : les exigences en 
capital, par exemple, étaient indépendantes de l’allocation d’actif. Désormais 
le nouveau cadre de supervision inclut des exigences de gouvernance, de 
coopération entre superviseurs européens d’un même groupe, de reporting et 
de transparence vis-à-vis du marché. Les principes mêmes de Solvabilité 2, 
Page 6 sur 7 
sans être parfaits certes, sont un net progrès : liberté d’investissement en 
contrepartie du respect du principe « de la personne prudente », évaluation 
conjointe des actifs et passifs d’assurance, prise en compte des « branches 
longues » pour atténuer les effets de la volatilité des marchés financiers sur 
les fonds propres.   
 
Cela étant, il y a aujourd’hui des évolutions souhaitables. Une phase de revue 
de la formule standard et du paquet branches longues est prévue au niveau 
européen à l’horizon 2018-2020. Ce rendez-vous est une opportunité pour des 
améliorations dans au moins trois directions :  
- Premièrement, la simplification du cadre réglementaire. La complexité 
de la formule standard n’est souhaitable ni pour l’industrie qui doit 
produire ces nouveaux calculs, ni pour les superviseurs, ni pour les 
marchés financiers.  
- Deuxièmement, il faut permettre aux assureurs de rester un vrai levier 
de financement de l’économie. Le secteur de l’assurance est le principal 
investisseur institutionnel de l’Union européenne, avec près de 
9 800 milliards d’euros investis en 2015 dans l’économie3. De ce sujet, 
vous m’avez souvent parlé… et il est maintenant bien identifié au niveau 
européen. Des améliorations sont déjà envisagées, en amont de la 
phase de revue, dans deux domaines : les entreprises d’infrastructure 
d’une part – l’EIOPA a proposé une révision ; les produits de titrisation 
de bonne qualité d’autre part. Plus globalement, il est indispensable de 
s’interroger sur les potentiels effets dissuasifs de Solvabilité 2 sur les 
investissements plus « à risque », nécessaires au bon fonctionnement 
de notre économie : les actions, cotées ou non, les prêts aux PME et 
ETI, mais aussi les actifs verts ou les investissements dans les 
entreprises innovantes. 
                                                     
3 European Insurance – Key facts, Insurance Europe, August 2016. 
Page 7 sur 7 
- Enfin, nous savons que Solvabilité II est plus volatile que le régime 
précédent. Des mesures ont déjà été intégrées afin de limiter les effets 
procycliques d’un bilan basé sur la valeur de marché. Je pense à 
l’ajustement égalisateur4, au correctif pour la volatilité5 et à l’ajustement 
symétrique pour le risque action 6 , qui viennent compléter un jeu de 
mesures transitoires permettant une entrée en application progressive 
du nouveau régime. Il conviendra, ces prochaines années, de juger de 
l’efficacité de ces mesures, et en cas d’insuffisance, de proposer 
d’éventuels amendements.  
** 
J’aurais pu parler aussi du digital, ou du changement climatique ; je vous sais 
mobilisés. Il y a pour l’avenir un repère sûr : dans un monde d’incertitudes, et 
donc de volatilité, le métier de l’assurance, votre métier, restera au cœur de 
deux enjeux clés, la protection contre les risques et le long terme. L’assurance 
est une force de la France et de son économie. Dans les évolutions à venir, 
soyez assurés que les agents de l’ACPR resteront pleinement mobilisés pour 
vous accompagner au quotidien. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence « L'avenir de l'épargne » – 4 novembre 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Excès d’épargne ou déficit d’investissement (« investment dearth ») ?  
 
Tout d'abord, je tiens à vous souhaiter chaleureusement à tous la 
bienvenue ici, à la Banque de France. Je suis très heureux d'inaugurer cette 
conférence consacrée à l'avenir de l'épargne, en compagnie d'intervenants et 
d'experts d'une telle qualité : universitaires de renom, éminents experts du 
secteur de la banque et de l'assurance, ainsi que régulateurs. Avant de leur 
laisser la parole, je voudrais partager avec vous quelques réflexions 
concernant le rôle que peut jouer l'épargne dans un contexte 
macroéconomique actuellement difficile.  
 La croissance après la crise a été décevante, aussi bien à l'échelle 
mondiale, avec un taux tout juste supérieur à 3 % en 2015 - et aussi très 
probablement en 2016, qu'en Europe, où elle plafonne  (diapo 2). Quel est 
donc le problème ? Nous devons à Ben Bernanke, au milieu des années 2000, 
d’avoir forgé la célèbre expression « global savings glut » (surabondance 
d'épargne au niveau mondial) pour désigner l'excédent d'épargne des 
économies de marché émergentes. L'épargne est toujours abondante au 
niveau mondial mais une chose a radicalement changé au cours des dernières 
années : (diapo 3) c’est l'investissement, qui a fortement diminué en 
proportion du PIB dans les économies avancées. C’est ce que je qualifie 
d'« investment dearth » ou pénurie d'investissement. C’est particulièrement 
vrai dans la zone euro, où l'écart entre l'épargne et l'investissement est très 
 
élevé : l'excédent du compte courant a atteint 350 milliards d'euros en rythme 
annuel en août 2016, soit plus de 3 % du PIB
i
. Je suis convaincu que la 
solution pour combler cet écart n’est pas de réduire l'épargne mais d’accroître 
l'investissement productif – et l'épargne peut jouer un rôle essentiel à cet 
égard. Permettez-moi d'approfondir le sujet en répondant à trois questions : 
quelles sont les preuves dont nous disposons ? Quelles sont les causes ? 
Quels sont les remèdes ? 
** 
Premièrement, quelles sont les preuves dont nous disposons ? 
Le ratio de l'investissement total rapporté au PIB offre un premier 
aperçu de la pénurie d'investissement actuelle (diapo 4). La crise de 
2007-2008 a entraîné une forte baisse du ratio d'investissement total. Dans de 
nombreux pays, il n'a pas encore retrouvé ses niveaux d'avant crise. C'est tout 
particulièrement le cas dans la zone euro où le ratio d'investissement total a 
diminué de 3 points environ depuis le point haut qu'il avait atteint en 2007 et 
ne s'est que légèrement redressé depuis. Par comparaison, le rythme de 
reprise est beaucoup plus soutenu aux États-Unis.   
Maintenant (diapo 5), regardons de plus près les composantes de cette 
pénurie d'investissement : l'investissement immobilier et l’investissement 
public ont contribué à la baisse de l'investissement total après la crise mais ce 
qui importe le plus pour notre économie, c'est la contraction de 
l'investissement des entreprises. Selon les estimations du FMI, il est de 10 
à 15 % inférieur aux prévisions d'avant-crise dans la zone euro
ii
. Toutefois, 
pour bien comprendre la situation, il nous faut examiner de plus près la nature 
de l'investissement des entreprises. Nous devons distinguer l'investissement 
dans la construction d'une part – qui n'est pas en soi facteur d'innovation – de 
l'investissement dans la recherche et le développement et dans les 
équipements industriels, d'autre part, ce que j'appelle l'« investissement 
productif »
iii
. Ce qui est préoccupant, c'est que son niveau est insuffisant : 
dans l'ensemble de l'économie, le taux d'investissement productif est resté 
 
longtemps inférieur à son niveau d'avant 2007 dans la zone euro et demeure 
plus faible en France qu'en Allemagne.  
Cela nous amène à la troisième caractéristique importante de cette 
pénurie d'investissement : le comportement des entreprises (diapo 6). 
Depuis 2009, il a radicalement changé : compte tenu de la faiblesse de 
l'investissement des entreprises, les sociétés non financières sont devenues 
prêteurs nets alors qu'elles étaient auparavant emprunteurs nets. Ainsi, elles 
ont alimenté l'excédent du compte courant de la zone euro. En résumé, toutes 
ces réalités convergent : la cause du problème qui se pose aujourd'hui en 
Europe réside davantage dans le déficit d'investissement que dans la 
surabondance de l'épargne. 
 
2. Quelles sont donc les causes de cette pénurie d'investissement ?  
Permettez-moi de m’arrêter sur les principaux leviers de 
l'investissement. Le premier, et le plus important, est la demande attendue 
(diapo 7). La faiblesse générale de l'activité économique a un effet dissuasif 
sur la plupart des entreprises. La dernière enquête semestrielle menée par 
Bpifrance montre que la demande demeure le principal obstacle à 
l'investissement pour les chefs des petites entreprises françaises
iv
. Ce 
diagnostic est confirmé au niveau macroéconomique par l'un des récents 
documents de travail de nos services, au terme de recherches sur un panel de 
22 économies avancées : la demande attendue constitue le principal 
déterminant du recul de l'investissement des entreprises (contribution négative 
de plus de 80 %)
v
. Le second levier économique important de l'investissement 
est la confiance ou, en d'autres termes, le niveau d'incertitude (17 %)
vi
. Si 
l'environnement est flou, complexe ou instable – en particulier du point de vue 
des règles et des normes –, les entreprises adoptent un comportement 
attentiste et reportent leurs décisions d'investissement. Par conséquent, la 
simplification et la stabilisation des règles est un moyen clé, mais souvent 
sous-estimé, de stimuler l'investissement des entreprises. 
 
Les leviers économiques sont les plus importants mais les leviers 
financiers jouent également un rôle. Actuellement, le coût du financement par 
endettement est faible dans la zone euro, il n’existe aucun signe de 
rationnement du crédit et, pourtant, l’investissement des entreprises ne réagit 
pas pleinement. Par conséquent, qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ? Deux éléments 
étroitement liés peuvent expliquer cette énigme. Premièrement, l’économie de 
l’Europe se situant « à la frontière technologique », les entreprises doivent 
innover davantage, ce qui signifie qu’elles doivent diversifier leurs sources de 
financement : pour pouvoir prendre plus de risques, elles ont besoin de moins 
d’autofinancement et de financement par endettement et de davantage de 
financement par fonds propres. Cependant, (diapositive 8) et c’est la seconde 
caractéristique de notre environnement actuel, le coût des capitaux propres 
(cost of equity - CoE) est resté élevé en dépit de la forte baisse des taux 
d’intérêt au cours des vingt dernières années. Selon les calculs de la Banque 
de France, le coût nominal des capitaux propres demeure supérieur à 9 % 
pour les grandes entreprises cotées dans la zone euro – alors que le taux 
sans risque se situe autour de 0 %. En d’autres termes, la prime de risque a 
augmenté. Le coût élevé des capitaux propres incite les entreprises à donner 
la priorité aux dividendes et aux rachats d’actions par rapport à 
l’investissement. De plus, cette situation va souvent de pair avec un taux de 
rendement minimal à dépasser (« hurdle rate »)
vii
 durablement élevé au sein 
des entreprises, avec pour résultat une sélection excessivement sévère des 
projets d’investissement. Les États-Unis en sont un bon exemple 
(diapositive 9) : depuis le début des années 2010, les rachats d’actions et les 
dividendes ont fortement augmenté pour représenter plus de 100 % des 
bénéfices déclarés, tandis que l’investissement productif s’est sensiblement 
ralenti jusqu’à enregistrer une croissance pratiquement nulle.  
 
3. Que peut-on faire pour remédier à la pénurie d’investissement 
(investment dearth) ? 
 
D’abord et avant tout, nous avons besoin en Europe d’une thérapie 
globale, tant économique que financière. Sur le plan économique, la politique 
monétaire est active et efficace mais elle ne peut pas rester la seule partie à 
jouer. La croissance sera plus forte en Europe si nous combinons des 
réformes structurelles – y compris des mesures pro-business – là où elles sont 
nécessaires, comme en France, et davantage de soutien budgétaire pour 
stimuler l’investissement dans les pays qui disposent d’une marge de 
manœuvre, comme l’Allemagne. Mais nous devons également traiter le volet 
financier de cette pénurie d’investissement. Les États-Unis nous montrent 
combien cela peut s’avérer crucial à long terme. Leur modèle a des 
caractéristiques positives : (diapositive 10) les fonds propres des entreprises 
représentent 121 % du PIB aux États-Unis, contre seulement 52 % dans la 
zone euro, ce qui signifie qu’aux États-Unis l’innovation trouve plus facilement 
les financements appropriés. Mais il a également des limites que nous devons 
garder à l’esprit : un coût des capitaux propres excessif peut avoir des effets 
néfastes.  
Pour relever ce défi financier, l’épargne a un rôle central à jouer. Je vais 
mettre l’accent sur deux pistes pour la diriger vers l’investissement productif. 
Premièrement, l’épargne doit être réorientée vers le long terme, plus 
aisément que vers la prise de risque directe. Les épargnants français, et plus 
généralement européens, affichent une plus grande aversion au risque que les 
américains et cela ne va probablement pas changer. Le premier motif 
d’épargne dans la zone euro est en effet de se prémunir contre des 
évènements inattendus (cité par plus de 50 % des ménages
viii
). Mais dans le 
même temps, les épargnants sont de plus en plus préoccupés par 
l’augmentation de l’espérance de vie et la nécessité de préparer leur retraite : 
la prévoyance pour la vieillesse arrive au deuxième rang des principaux motifs 
d’épargne (près de 40 % des ménages
ix
). Il y a donc un sens à proposer aux 
épargnants, à titre complémentaire, de nouveaux produits d’épargne, moins 
liquides au cours des premières années mais assortis d’une forme de 
protection du capital sur le long terme. Ces nouveaux produits offriront aux 
 
intermédiaires financiers – en particulier aux sociétés d’assurance-vie – des 
passifs suffisamment longs pour leur permettre de prendre des risques 
mutualisés, essentiellement sous forme d’investissements en capital, et 
permettront aux épargnants de bénéficier du meilleur rendement des actions 
sur la durée. Pour promouvoir ces produits, il faut également à tout le moins 
éviter les distorsions fiscales qui pourraient les pénaliser davantage que les 
investissements liquides et sans risque.  
Deuxièmement, l’épargne doit mieux circuler à travers l’Europe, 
pour se diriger là où se trouvent les besoins d’investissement. Une grande 
partie de la solution se situe au niveau européen, avec la construction de ce 
que j’appelle une « Union de financement et d’investissement » (UFI), 
plutôt qu’une « Union des marchés de capitaux » seulement. Cette UFI 
regrouperait les initiatives qui existent déjà, l’Union des marchés de capitaux 
bien sûr mais aussi le Plan Juncker et l’Union bancaire, afin d’en amplifier 
l’impact par des synergies et des mesures plus ambitieuses. Permettez-moi de 
citer deux mesures visant à surmonter les obstacles à l’investissement 
transfrontière. Premièrement, l’UFI encouragerait le développement d’un 
écosystème paneuropéen de capital-risque. Une des limites les plus claires de 
l’Europe est la taille de ses fonds comparés à ceux des États-Unis : l’échelle 
de tailles varie d’au moins 1 à 10 en raison des frontières nationales et du 
biais domestique en Europe. Cela limite malheureusement la capacité des 
fonds européens à prendre des participations suffisamment importantes, 
notamment dans des entreprises prometteuses (« scale up » companies), qui 
deviendront ultérieurement des start-ups à succès. Le second exemple 
concerne les barrières réglementaires et juridiques au financement par fonds 
propres. L’UFI favoriserait une plus grande harmonisation des régimes de 
faillite et une information financière plus large et plus standardisée sur les 
entreprises européennes, y compris les PME. À cet égard, l’expérience 
acquise dans certains États membres – en France par exemple, l’expertise de 
la banque centrale en matière de cotation des entreprises – pourrait être mise 
à profit.   
 
** 
En conclusion, permettez-moi de citer Benjamin Franklin qui, dans son essai 
intitulé The Way to Wealth, donnait un conseil qui reste largement d’actualité : 
« les grands vaisseaux peuvent s’aventurer davantage, mais les petits 
bateaux doivent rester près du rivage ». Dans le contexte actuel, l’épargne 
ressemble certainement plus à un grand vaisseau qu’à un petit bateau. Et 
pourtant, à la différence des grands vaisseaux, elle ne prend pas 
suffisamment de risques raisonnables. Notre avenir dépendra de sa capacité à 
s’aventurer davantage pour contribuer à résorber la pénurie d’investissement, 
fléau de notre économie. Je vous ai fait part de mes réflexions sur les formes 
que cette évolution pourrait prendre et je vous souhaite des débats fructueux 
tout au long de cette conférence.

Convention financière annuelle de l’Asociación de Mercados Financieros 
Madrid, 21 novembre 2016 
François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
L’Europe confrontée à une nouvelle économie politique 
 
Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je vous remercie de votre invitation. Je vous remercie de cette opportunité de 
m’exprimer aujourd’hui, ici à Madrid, avec mon ami le gouverneur L. Linde, devant la 
communauté financière espagnole et dans un pays qui a démontré son engagement actif 
dans le projet européen depuis son adhésion à l’Union européenne il y a trente ans. Nous 
avons parcouru un long chemin en Europe et notre histoire commune et nos réussites 
passées nous aideront à aborder l’avenir en cette période difficile. Le référendum sur le 
Brexit en juin et la victoire de M. Trump il y a deux semaines ont constitué de véritables 
chocs pour l’Europe : tous deux ont accru l’incertitude et questionnent l’identité européenne. 
Comment réagir en tant qu’Européens ? Pas par moins d’Europe : ce serait évidemment une 
erreur si nous voulons maîtriser collectivement notre destin dans ce monde nouveau. Mais 
par une « meilleure » Europe, plus concentrée sur ses priorités et plus efficace. 
Concrètement, nous devons nous adapter de deux manières : premièrement, en tirant 
activement parti de nos atouts économiques et sociaux – notamment notre monnaie unique 
et notre politique monétaire ; deuxièmement, en nous rassemblant autour de quelques 
priorités nouvelles soigneusement sélectionnées – y compris remédier à l’actuelle pénurie 
d’investissement.   
** 
I. Premièrement, les atouts de l’Europe dans la nouvelle « économie politique ». 
Permettez-moi de commencer par une brève remarque d’ordre terminologique. 
Longtemps, les grands économistes ont utilisé le terme d’économie politique à propos de la 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
 
discipline que nous appelons aujourd’hui l’« économie », qu’il s’agisse d’Adam Smith, de 
David Ricardo ou de Léon Walras, pour n’en citer que quelques-uns. En dépit d’une histoire 
vieille de quatre cents ans, le terme d’« économie politique » a progressivement perdu de 
l’importance au cours des dernières décennies en tant qu’approche globale des questions 
économiques. Et pourtant, il pourrait désormais revenir au premier plan, compte tenu des 
fortes interactions entre la politique et l’économie. Au niveau international, nous ne pouvons 
pas encore prévoir ce que sera réellement la présidence de M. Trump mais nous pouvons 
nous attendre à un changement majeur de politique, qui aura des conséquences sur la 
politique économique des États-Unis. Par ailleurs, le cycle électoral va se poursuivre en 
Europe, en commençant par le référendum italien de décembre. De toute évidence, la 
première certitude est que nous sommes confrontés à une grande incertitude. Comment 
l’Europe va-t-elle surmonter  cette situation ? Pas par une politique attentiste, je l’espère 
sincèrement, mais plutôt en préservant et en développant davantage les trois atouts 
économiques et sociaux qu’elle partage : la monnaie unique, le marché unique et le 
modèle social qui lui est propre. Nous devons travailler activement à les développer, et ne 
pas nous reposer paresseusement sur nos lauriers : la fierté ne doit pas être confondue avec 
l’autosatisfaction.  
Premièrement, avec l’euro, nous partageons une monnaie solide qui est reconnue dans 
le monde entier. Les citoyens de la zone euro y sont très majoritairement attachés (à 68 % 
selon le dernier Eurobaromètre
i
). De plus, dans un monde d’incertitudes, la politique 
monétaire européenne constitue un repère de stabilité. Au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs 
de la BCE, autour de Mario Draghi, nous prenons très au sérieux le devoir qui nous a été 
confié par les Traités européens : assurer la stabilité des prix, à savoir un taux d’inflation à 
moyen terme proche de, mais inférieur à, 2 %. Notre politique monétaire a préservé la zone 
euro de la menace de la déflation sur la période récente et elle réalise des progrès tangibles 
nous rapprochant de notre cible d’inflation : l’inflation a atteint 0,5 % en octobre et devrait 
dépasser 1 % début 2017. Elle soutient la demande tout en réduisant l’écart de production 
(output gap), qui est revenu de – 2,4 % en 2014 à – 1,0 % en 2016, d’après les estimations 
de la Commission européenne
ii
. L’Eurosystème a déjà fourni une abondante liquidité à 
l’économie européenne : nos avoirs détenus dans le cadre du programme étendu d’achats 
d’actifs s’élevaient à près de 1 400 milliards d’euros en octobre 2016.   
Nous pouvons dresser le bilan des progrès accomplis, tout en restant attentifs aux 
dernières évolutions financières et à leurs effets économiques contrastés : la hausse des 
marchés d'actions, mais aussi celle des taux d’intérêt à long terme ; l’appréciation du dollar, 
mais la quasi-stabilité du taux de change global de l’euro ; et la hausse des anticipations 
d’inflation. Nous devons à la fois avoir confiance en nos progrès et être vigilants vis-à-vis de 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
 
notre environnement. Jusqu’en mars, nous continuerons de mettre en œuvre notre politique 
en exacte conformité avec ce que nous avons annoncé : notre réussite manifeste à acquérir 
aujourd’hui des actifs pour un montant de 80 milliards d’euros par mois, y compris des 
obligations d’entreprises, est la meilleure garantie de notre crédibilité future. Je suis certain 
que lors de nos prochaines réunions de politique monétaire, au cours des mois à venir, nous 
déciderons, avec une approche pragmatique, de la meilleure évolution au-delà du mois de 
mars de tous les outils à notre disposition : l’assouplissement quantitatif (QE), les TLTRO et 
les indications sur la trajectoire future des taux d’intérêt (forward guidance). Et de 
nombreuses options sont ouvertes quant à la taille et à la durée de nos instruments, comme 
l’APP, à l’exclusion d’un arrêt brutal de sa contribution à notre politique accommodante en 
mars ou de la poursuite de cette même contribution pour toujours. 
Deuxième atout, nous partageons en Europe un grand marché unique. C’est un 
formidable actif qui appartient collectivement à nos 27 pays. Ce n’est pas pour rien que 
l’accès au marché unique est au cœur des débats qui entourent le « Brexit ». Nous ne 
pouvons pas préjuger du résultat des négociations qui vont avoir lieu mais un principe de 
cohérence s’impose : l’accès au marché unique doit continuer d’aller de pair avec le respect 
strict de toutes ses règles. Il ne peut pas y avoir d’Europe « à la carte » (cherry-picking), ni 
de « passager clandestin » (free-riding). Et nous devons évidemment préserver la politique 
commerciale européenne unique si nous voulons continuer d’exister dans les négociations 
commerciales à venir dans le monde entier. 
Troisièmement, nous partageons un modèle social commun (diapo 2) qui combine un 
haut niveau de service public et des inégalités relativement faibles – nettement moins fortes 
que dans la société américaine. Et ceci au sein d’une économie de marché. À l’heure où la 
mondialisation peut produire de nombreux laissés-pour-compte dans les économies 
avancées, où le débat à propos des inégalités revient au premier plan – et ce sont des défis 
réels derrière la vague populiste – ce n’est pas le moment de renoncer à notre modèle 
social. Mais cette ambition doit être lucide : dans certains pays comme la France et l’Italie, le 
coût élevé de ce modèle et ses résultats décevants en termes de croissance et d’emploi 
rendent nécessaire une accélération des réformes dans la bonne direction (diapo 3). 
Plusieurs pays européens, dont l’Allemagne et l’Espagne, montrent la voie à suivre : ils ont 
réussi à mener à bien des réformes de grande ampleur compatibles avec notre modèle 
social commun. Des progrès ont été réalisés dans les quatre principaux domaines : 
l’Entreprise, l’Emploi, l’Éducation et l’État (réduction des dépenses publiques). Et ces 
réformes donnent des résultats aujourd’hui : ces dernières années, le PIB et l’emploi ont 
progressé beaucoup plus vite dans les pays « réformateurs » qu’en France ou en Italie par 
exemple.  
Page 4 sur 7 
 
 
 
II. Au-delà de nos atouts existants, nous devons, en Europe, rassembler nos énergies 
pour rester maîtres de notre destin commun.  
L’Europe a besoin que tous les États membres contribuent à l’effort commun. Elle a 
besoin de la France aussi bien que de l’Espagne et de son engagement européen constant. 
Pour que ce soit une réussite, les projets visant à renforcer l’Europe doivent être choisis 
avec soin et classés par ordre de priorité ; et nous ne devons pas simplement en parler, 
nous devons nous donner les moyens pratiques d’obtenir des résultats concrets. En 
résumé : « peu, bien, jusqu’au bout » ou, en Espagnol si vous le permettez, « poco, bién, 
hasta el final ». Il y a bien sûr des domaines non-économiques : pour en citer quelques-uns, 
la défense et la protection des frontières, le changement climatique ou l’éducation et la 
formation des jeunes – un programme Erasmus Pro devrait être une priorité pour mettre fin à 
ce drame de la jeunesse sans emploi ni diplôme, qui est commun à la France, à l’Italie et à 
l’Espagne. Mais dans le domaine économique, il reste beaucoup à faire également. Bien que 
nous ayons réussi l’union monétaire, nous devons progresser sur la voie de l’union 
économique – afin que la politique monétaire ne reste pas la seule partie jouée.  
 
1. La première priorité sur le plan économique consiste à s’attaquer aux causes 
profondes de la faiblesse persistante de la croissance en Europe, dont l’une 
des principales est ce que j’appelle la « pénurie d’investissement » 
(« investment crunch »). 
(diapo 4) Nombreux sont ceux qui, à la suite du discours de Ben Bernanke en 
mars 2005, ont parlé à juste titre de la « surabondance d’épargne au niveau mondial » qui 
exerçait des pressions sur les économies du monde. Actuellement, l’épargne reste élevée en 
raison de la conjonction de surplus importants dans les économies de marché émergentes et 
du vieillissement des populations des pays avancés. Cependant (diapo 5), ce qui a 
radicalement changé depuis la crise de 2007-2008, c’est l’investissement, qui a fortement 
diminué en proportion du PIB dans les économies avancées. Dans la zone euro, le ratio de 
l’investissement total rapporté au PIB a baissé de 3 points environ depuis le pic de 2007 et 
ne s’est que légèrement redressé depuis lors. L’écart entre l’épargne et l’investissement est 
donc très élevé : l’excédent du compte courant a atteint 350 milliards d’euros en rythme 
annuel en août 2016, soit plus de 3 % du PIB. Cette « pénurie d’investissement »   – plutôt 
que la « surabondance de l’épargne » – freine notre croissance.  
Page 5 sur 7 
 
 
Il est vrai qu’une part du recul de l’investissement total depuis la crise provient d’une 
chute de l’investissement immobilier, qui était en plein essor avant la crise, notamment dans 
les pays ayant connu des bulles immobilières comme l’Espagne. Mais ce qui importe le plus 
pour notre croissance à long terme est l’investissement des entreprises – et plus 
précisément l’« investissement productif » (diapo 6) – qui comprend l’investissement dans la 
recherche et le développement et dans les équipements industriels, par opposition à 
l’investissement dans la construction, qui n’est pas en soi facteur d’innovation. Il est 
préoccupant de constater que le taux d’investissement productif est longtemps resté inférieur 
à son niveau d’avant la crise dans la zone euro. En outre, il a été plus faible en France et en 
Espagne que dans l’ensemble de la zone euro, même s’il s’est redressé ces dernières 
années, notamment en Espagne. Ces évolutions se sont traduites par une modification 
radicale du comportement des entreprises (diapo 7) : depuis mi-2009, les sociétés non 
financières de la zone euro sont passées d’une situation d’emprunteurs nets à celle de 
prêteurs nets, alimentant ainsi l’excédent du compte courant de la zone euro.    
2. Pour remédier à la « pénurie d’investissement », nous avons besoin d’une thérapie 
globale, à la fois économique et financière.  
Sur le plan économique, l’investissement des entreprises dépend de deux leviers 
(diapo 8). Le premier est la demande attendue. Les travaux de recherche de la Banque de 
France
iii
, sur la base d’un panel de 22 économies avancées, montrent que, sur la période 
1996-2014, elle a constitué le principal déterminant du recul de l’investissement des 
entreprises (contribution négative de 80 %). Le second levier est la confiance ou, en 
d’autres termes, le niveau d’incertitude (17 %). Concrètement, il faut que les règles 
deviennent plus simples et plus stables pour les entrepreneurs. La France et l’Espagne sont 
encore loin des pays les plus performants dans le dernier classement de l’indicateur Doing 
Business de la Banque mondiale : nous arrivons en 29
e
 et 32
e
 positions, respectivement
iv
.  
Mais parallèlement aux leviers économiques, les leviers financiers jouent également un 
rôle (diapo 9). Comme l’économie de l’Europe est proche de la « frontière technologique », 
les entreprises doivent innover davantage. Elles doivent donc être capables de prendre plus 
de risques, ce qui signifie davantage de financement par fonds propres, plutôt que du 
financement par endettement. Mais l’Europe est en retard : les fonds propres représentent 
seulement 52 % du PIB dans la zone euro, contre 121 % aux États-Unis. Par ailleurs 
(diapo 10), le coût des capitaux propres est resté étonnamment élevé des deux côtés de 
l’Atlantique – plus de 9 % pour les grandes entreprises cotées de la zone euro selon les 
calculs de la Banque de France –, malgré la forte baisse des taux d’intérêt observée ces 
deux dernières décennies. Cela signifie que les primes de risque ont augmenté. Le coût 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
 
élevé des capitaux propres pourrait inciter les entreprises à donner la priorité aux dividendes 
et aux rachats d’actions par rapport à l’investissement – nous avons constaté cette situation 
aux États-Unis.  
Quelle est donc la solution en pratique ? À l’évidence, comme je l’ai déjà mentionné 
précédemment, nous avons besoin de réformes économiques et sociales au niveau national. 
Mais une grande partie de la solution se trouve au niveau européen : (diapo 11) 
actuellement, l’Europe a besoin de ce que j’appelle une « Union de financement et 
d’investissement » (UFI) afin de diriger l’épargne abondante vers l’investissement productif. 
L’UFI regrouperait les initiatives déjà en place mais qui ne donnent pas suffisamment de 
résultats : l’Union des marchés de capitaux, bien sûr, mais également le plan Juncker et 
l’Union bancaire. Nous devons mettre les pièces du puzzle en place afin d’en amplifier 
l’impact par des synergies. Il faut atteindre deux objectifs : une plus grande diversification du 
financement des entreprises        – avec davantage de financement par fonds propres – et 
une plus grande résilience de la zone euro grâce au partage privé des risques au-delà des 
frontières.  
3. Au-delà de l’« Union de financement et d’investissement », qui constitue la première 
étape, je pense que l’Europe doit progresser avec deux nouvelles étapes concrètes. 
  
La deuxième étape, après l’UFI, est une stratégie économique collective pour la zone 
euro. La croissance et l’emploi seront plus forts en Europe si nous combinons davantage de 
réformes là où elles sont nécessaires, comme en France et en Italie, et davantage de 
soutien budgétaire dans les pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre, comme l’Allemagne. 
En pratique, pour que cette stratégie économique collective puisse exister, la zone euro doit 
surmonter le sentiment actuel de méfiance. Elle a donc besoin d’une institution qui favorise 
la confiance : cela pourrait être un ministre des Finances de la zone euro. Il serait 
responsable de la définition de la stratégie collective avec l’Eurogroupe et garantirait sa mise 
en œuvre dans chaque pays. Il aurait également pour mission de gérer un Mécanisme 
européen de stabilité (MES) renforcé. En termes de calendrier, cette deuxième étape ne 
peut raisonnablement se produire qu’après les élections prévues l’année prochaine dans 
certains pays de la zone euro, car elle nécessite de modifier les Traités européens. 
La troisième étape, à plus long terme, serait de compléter l’Union économique et 
monétaire par une capacité budgétaire européenne. Cela implique d’obtenir davantage de 
confiance de la part des États membres, afin d’éviter qu’elle ne soit perçue comme une 
« union de transfert » à sens unique. Un véritable budget au niveau de la zone euro 
constituerait un instrument de stabilisation et pourrait comprendre, par exemple, un dispositif 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
 
d’indemnisation du chômage au niveau européen. Il pourrait également servir à financer 
certains « biens publics européens » tels que la technologie numérique, la transition 
énergétique ou l’intégration des réfugiés. Et à long terme, il pourrait directement émettre une 
dette commune et même collecter des impôts. 
** 
En résumé, pour surmonter les obstacles qui existent actuellement au plan mondial, 
nous, les Européens, devons préserver nos trois atouts économiques et sociaux communs. 
Et nous ne pouvons nous contenter d’être attentistes. À ce titre, je vous ai fait part de mon 
opinion de banquier central quant au chemin que nous pouvons emprunter dans le domaine 
économique. Il est désormais temps pour les Européens de s’engager dans des actions 
décisives afin de pouvoir aborder l’avenir avec confiance. Comme l’a formulé le célèbre 
philosophe madrilène José Ortega y Gasset : « La vie est une série de collisions avec le 
futur ; elle n’est pas la somme de ce que nous avons été, mais ce que nous aspirons à 
être ». Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence de l’ACPR du 25 novembre 2016  
Discours introductif de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et Président de l’Autorité de 
Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution 
Les banques et les assurances face à la révolution digitale 
 
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour cette nouvelle 
conférence de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR). 
Après le lancement du Forum FinTech et la création d’un pôle FinTech-
Innovation, nous voulons en effet continuer à accompagner l’innovation dans 
le secteur financier. Je sais que beaucoup des FinTech françaises sont 
présentes dans la salle et je m’en réjouis. C’est la démonstration du 
dynamisme de l’industrie financière française et du savoir-faire de ses 
entrepreneurs.   
 Pour fournir à chacun d’entre vous les repères utiles au développement 
de vos entreprises et à la réussite de vos projets innovants, les services de 
l’ACPR vous présenteront ce matin notre action à l’égard des FinTechs – de 
l’agrément au contrôle. Je veux quant à moi replacer les FinTechs dans le 
contexte plus large de la révolution digitale qui bouscule l’ensemble du secteur 
financier. J’aborderai trois questions : en quoi la révolution digitale est-elle un 
défi pour les établissements financiers ? Comment, en pratique, peuvent-ils y 
répondre ? Et comment la réglementation et la supervision s’adaptent-elles ?  
Page 2 sur 6 
 
 
 
 
1. D’abord, en quoi la révolution digitale est-elle un défi ? 
L’innovation n’est pas une histoire nouvelle pour le secteur financier : les 
distributeurs automatiques, les cartes bancaires, l’informatisation et internet 
ont été à l’origine de profondes mutations du secteur. Ce qui est 
fondamentalement nouveau aujourd’hui, c’est la vitesse avec laquelle les 
nouveaux usages digitaux se diffusent.  S’il est symbolique et forcément 
réducteur, un chiffre me paraît illustrer cette accélération : c’est celui de la 
fréquentation des agences bancaires qui bouscule le modèle historique de la 
relation clientèle. En 2007, 62 % des Français fréquentent leur agence 
plusieurs fois par mois. Ils ne sont plus que 52 % en 2010 ; et, en 2016, ce 
chiffre est tombé à 20 %, et même 13 % seulement pour les 18-34 ans
1
.  
La révolution digitale que nous vivons aujourd’hui n’est pas sans 
risques : le risque tout d’abord pour les acteurs établis de perdre des parts de 
marché et de voir s’amoindrir leurs sources de revenus, ce d’autant plus que 
le digital se prête moins au modèle éprouvé de cross-selling et d’optimisation 
par client ; les risques d’exécution ensuite, qui sont inhérents à toute 
transformation d’envergure y compris sur la qualification et la motivation des 
personnels ; et enfin les risques plus spécifiquement liés à la finance digitale, 
comme la cybercriminalité et les risques opérationnels liés à la conservation et 
à l’usage des données personnelles. C’est pourquoi l’ACPR et la Banque de 
France sont très vigilants. 
Mais la révolution digitale crée aussi pour le secteur financier des 
opportunités qu’il faut savoir saisir : celles de rendre le système financier plus 
sûr, la conformité aux exigences réglementaires et la lutte contre la fraude 
plus efficaces – ce qu’on appelle la « RegTech » –, les services financiers plus 
nombreux et plus accessibles, la satisfaction des clients plus complète, la 
protection de leurs intérêts mieux assurée. Dans les transformations en cours 
et à venir, la révolution digitale peut reconstruire ce que la crise financière

avait en partie détruit : une confiance renouvelée entre les Français et leurs 
acteurs financiers.  
 
2. Comment, en pratique, répondre à ce défi ?  
Dans ce nouvel environnement, les banques et les assurances sont face 
à des choix stratégiques difficiles. Les réponses ne sont ni évidentes, ni 
uniformes ; et il va de soi que ce sont les établissements qui restent 
pleinement maîtres de leurs orientations stratégiques. Je veux toutefois 
partager avec vous quelques pistes d’évolution, essentiellement sur les 
banques même si les assurances sont concernées également mais 
différemment. Je le ferai autour de deux questions : quel business model pour 
répondre à la révolution digitale ? Et quelle gestion stratégique ?  
 
a. D’abord, quel business model ? 
 Face à l’accélération de la  transformation digitale, il ne faut pas oublier 
que les établissements français ont des atouts indéniables. Ils disposent d’une 
clientèle large, de données nombreuses et bien sécurisées, d’une forte 
expérience dans la gestion des risques et la conformité aux exigences 
réglementaires. Et je suis convaincu que le conseil humain continuera à être 
un socle indispensable dans la relation client. L’adaptation des business 
models à la révolution digitale nécessite cependant de mener une réflexion 
d’ensemble : à la fois du côté des revenus et du côté des coûts. Et ce d’autant 
plus que deux autres environnements concomitants – le contexte global de 
taux d’intérêt bas et les évolutions réglementaires – ont certes des 
justifications fortes mais accentuent encore la pression sur les établissements 
financiers.  
 Côtés revenus, une des réponses aux évolutions en cours peut venir de 
la diversification des services – propres ou en partenariat – proposés aux 
clients, comme de l’évolution éventuelle de leur tarification : avec moins de 
prix fixes et davantage de tarification à l’usage. Dans l’environnement actuel, 
la pluralité des activités est une force pour les établissements financiers. La 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
 
 
banque de détail, fortement valorisée juste après la crise financière, semble 
davantage souffrir aujourd’hui. Il faut je crois relativiser ces cycles 
stratégiques, voire ces modes. Mais incontestablement les business models 
diversifiés entre banque de détail, banque de financement et d’investissement 
et services financiers spécialisés – tels que développés par beaucoup de 
banques françaises – permettent à la fois de mieux faire face aux chocs 
spécifiques et d’assurer des sources de revenu variées.  
Côté coûts, les plans de gestion prévisionnelle de l’emploi et des 
compétences doivent être un levier central de transformation. En effet, mieux 
ces mutations sont anticipées, mieux elles se dérouleront sur le plan social. La 
révolution digitale nécessite des compétences et des qualifications spécifiques 
dont l’importance sera croissante – dans le domaine des technologies 
numériques ou de l’analyse des données par exemple, mais aussi de la 
nouvelle relation client.  
 
b. Ensuite, quelle gestion stratégique ?   
De toute évidence, pour faire face à la transformation digitale, 
l’innovation doit être au cœur des choix stratégiques à venir des 
établissements financiers. Elle passe d’abord par une gouvernance forte, pour 
incarner la culture de l’innovation au plus haut niveau et la diffuser à 
l’ensemble de l’entreprise (le « tone from the top » anglo-saxon). Elle passe 
aussi naturellement par une ouverture vers l’extérieur : le développement des 
partenariats avec des FinTechs, ainsi que les relations avec le monde 
académique, sont des clés pour accroître le potentiel d’innovation.  
Mais le choix de l’innovation se joue également au niveau des systèmes 
d’information. La transformation numérique appelle des investissements 
importants dans ce domaine, à la fois pour fournir un service toujours plus 
adapté aux clients, pour réduire les coûts structurels et pour renforcer la 
conformité aux exigences réglementaires. Les systèmes d’information devront 
être d’une part plus sûrs, pour offrir une protection forte contre les  cyber-
risques, et d’autre part plus souples et plus propices à l’inter-connectivité : 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
 
 
nous savons tous comme cette tension est difficile. Mais la flexibilité des 
systèmes d’information doit permettre aux établissements de mieux associer 
les partenaires extérieurs mais aussi de mieux valoriser, pour leurs propres 
besoins et dans un cadre de conformité exigeant, les données de leurs clients.  
 
3. Les établissements financiers ne sont pas les seuls à s’adapter à la 
finance digitale. La réglementation et la supervision s’ajustent aussi.   
Face à l’émergence de la finance digitale, la réglementation doit 
répondre à un double impératif : s’adapter pour ne pas brider l’innovation, 
mais continuer à garantir un haut niveau de sécurité des transactions et de 
protection des consommateurs. Le cadre réglementaire a évolué en ce sens 
en 2016, notamment pour permettre le recours à la technologie « blockchain » 
dans plusieurs domaines : comme moyen d’enregistrement et de conservation 
des nouveaux outils de financement participatif appelés minibons, et 
également comme moyen de gestion des titres non cotés – ce dispositif issu 
de la loi Sapin 2 doit être précisé par une ordonnance à venir. Les acteurs 
français peuvent et doivent se saisir de ces évolutions législatives pour 
poursuivre leur développement et tester ces nouvelles technologies en 
conditions réelles. En parallèle, les autorités de supervision restent très 
vigilantes. L’ACPR vient par exemple de publier une recommandation sur 
l’usage des médias sociaux à des fins commerciales
2
. Nous tenons, comme 
vous, à ce qu’il n’y ait pas de distorsion structurelle de concurrence par la 
réglementation entre les acteurs existants et les nouveaux entrants : oui à la 
proportionnalité des règles, mais non à leur iniquité. 
Au-delà de la nécessaire adaptation de la réglementation, la 
transformation digitale nous conduit à modifier nos pratiques de supervision. 
L’ACPR s’est structurée pour rester en phase avec les évolutions du secteur 
financier et anticiper celles à venir : elle a créé cette année un pôle dédié aux 
FinTechs et à l’innovation, en collaboration étroite avec l’AMF, et elle anime le 
Forum FinTech pour un dialogue constructif avec tous les acteurs du domaine.

 Recommandation 2016-R-01 du 14 novembre 2016. 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
 
 
Enfin, la révolution digitale conduit la Banque de France et l’ACPR à se 
transformer aussi. Nous sommes convaincus que l’innovation est un atout, 
que nous devons mettre au service de nos missions de stabilité financière et 
de protection des consommateurs. Thierry Bedoin, le nouveau Chief Digital 
Officer de la Banque de France, vous en parlera en fin de matinée.  
 
*** 
Notre engagement comme régulateur et comme superviseur est donc 
clair : nous voulons à la fois davantage d’innovation et davantage de sécurité. 
Dans ce contexte de profonde mutation du secteur financier, je dois terminer 
ici par une alerte : il est essentiel que les ressources affectées à l’ACPR ne 
soient pas plafonnées à des niveaux incompatibles avec la poursuite de ses 
actions. De ce point de vue, la proposition dans le PLF pour 2017 d’un 
abaissement de 3 millions d’euros de ces ressources est inopportune : 
prélever, pour la première fois, sur les cotisations de supervision des banques 
et assurances pour abonder le budget général serait d’autant moins justifié 
que les moyens de l’ACPR sont d’ores et déjà plus limités que ceux des 
superviseurs des autres grands pays européens comme l’Allemagne ou le 
Royaume-Uni
3
. Il est plus que jamais indispensable que l’ACPR reste forte et 
efficace. La sécurisation du système financier, la protection des 
consommateurs, la lutte contre les cyber-risques, le blanchiment d’argent ou 
encore le terrorisme – toutes missions que nous demandent légitimement le 
Parlement et nos concitoyens – en dépendent. Soyez assurés de notre 
détermination à les mener, a fortiori en environnement digital. Je vous 
remercie de votre attention et vous souhaite une excellente conférence.

 En 2015, le budget de la BaFin était de 235 millions d’euros (sans compter les ressources de la Bundesbank 
pour ses missions de contrôle bancaire), celui de la PRA de 253 millions de livres (exercice du 1er mars 2015 au 
28 février 2016), soit 20 millions de plus que l’année précédente, contre des moyens d’au plus 200 millions 
d’euros pour l’ACPR en 2016.

Conférence de l’ACPR du 20 novembre 2015  
 
« Le contrôle des pratiques commerciales » 
 
Discours introductif de François Villeroy de Galhau 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et  
Président de l’Autorité de Contrôle prudentiel et de résolution 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir à cette conférence de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel 
et de résolution, et vous remercie de votre présence. Cette journée est pour moi l’occasion 
de dire, pour la première fois devant vous, toute l’importance que j’attache à ce type 
d’événements, où l’Autorité que je préside fait connaître son action et les principes qui la 
guident. C’est également pour nous l’occasion d’écouter les parties intéressées, sur le thème 
qui nous réunit aujourd’hui – celui du contrôle des pratiques commerciales – sur lequel je 
voudrais avancer trois idées : 
(I) D’abord, notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales importe pour la 
mobilisation actuelle de la Nation. 
(II) Ensuite, notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales importe pour la 
stabilité financière. 
(III) Enfin, notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales doit de plus en 
plus intégrer les évolutions européennes et technologiques. 
I/ Notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales importe pour la mobilisation 
actuelle de la Nation. 
Beaucoup de leçons peuvent être tirées des dramatiques attentats survenus vendredi 
dernier à Paris et en région parisienne, qui doivent nous conduire à une mobilisation totale. 
Face à ces actes barbares, je veux rappeler la détermination de la Banque de France – et du 
2 
 
secteur financier – à participer à la lutte contre le terrorisme, en s’attaquant à son 
financement.  
Nombre d’entre vous serez d’ailleurs présents cet après-midi aux présentations, introduites 
par M. DELAS, vice-président de l’ACPR, sur la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le 
financement du terrorisme dans le secteur de l’assurance. Comme vous le savez, le Collège 
de l’ACPR vient précisément d’adopter la semaine dernière de nouvelles lignes directrices 
dans ce domaine, valables pour la banque et l’assurance, conjointement avec Tracfin. Je n’ai 
pas de doute que l’implication du secteur financier dans leur mise en œuvre sera totale ; 
nous y veillerons avec les professionnels. 
Je veux aussi rappeler aujourd’hui notre détermination à participer pleinement à la 
mobilisation de la Nation, en œuvrant plus largement pour la cohésion économique et 
sociale, par une plus forte inclusion bancaire et financière. La protection des 
consommateurs – et notamment des plus fragiles – en est l’une des composantes. 
L’éducation financière, la lutte contre le surendettement sont aussi des priorités auxquelles la 
Banque de France contribue activement. Le terrorisme, hélas, se nourrit aussi de l’exclusion 
sous ses différentes formes. 
 
II/ Deuxième remarque, notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales importe 
aussi pour la stabilité financière. 
La loi donne désormais à l’ACPR, depuis sa création en 2010, la mission de veiller à la 
stabilité financière et à la protection des clients. C’est une grande innovation   un acte fort, 
après la crise de 2008 et la perte de confiance des clients dans leur secteur financier, 
constatée dans beaucoup de pays occidentaux, parfois du fait de pratiques commerciales 
trompeuses. Rétablir la confiance, c’est évidemment  l’intérêt de tous présents dans cette 
salle. C’est pour notre part veiller au respect des lois et des règlements existants, mais aussi 
des bonnes pratiques constatées ou recommandées par l’Autorité. 
Naturellement, cette mission de protection de la clientèle n’est pas conçue comme la seule 
vérification de règles disparates. Elle doit au contraire être exercée dans la compréhension 
des principes qui sous-tendent ces réglementations et dans la compréhension de la réalité 
des pratiques commerciales. 
Les principes, si je voulais les résumer en une phrase, visent tous à équilibrer d’une façon 
ou d’une autre la relation entre le client et le professionnel. Ce rééquilibrage passe 
notamment par la prise en compte de l’asymétrie d’informations qui peut exister entre eux. Il 
peut s’agir de règles propres à une clientèle vulnérable, à une catégorie de produits 
3 
 
complexes, à l’obligation de prendre en compte les intérêts du client dès la conception du 
produit ou dans l’organisation de la distribution. 
La réalité des pratiques, en revanche, est difficile à résumer en quelques mots. C’est dans 
ce domaine que porte l’effort des services de l’ACPR, par le contrôle mais également par 
l’analyse d’une information diversifiée et par les contacts avec les parties prenantes, 
professionnels comme consommateurs. La collecte d’informations sur les pratiques est un 
préalable indispensable, qui permet à l’ACPR d’orienter son action de contrôle. C’est bien 
dans cette optique que l’ACPR a refondu son questionnaire sur les pratiques commerciales 
et la protection de la clientèle. Désormais, elle peut savoir qui fait quoi sur le marché, 
connaître les tendances en matière de produits, de services et de pratiques. 
J’en viens aux contrôles proprement dits. Ils sont destinés en premier lieu à vérifier le 
respect des règles applicables et à faire corriger les erreurs avant qu’elles n’aient de 
conséquences pour les clients. Dans les cas les plus graves, ils débouchent sur des 
sanctions. Cette approche est nécessaire pour condamner les manquements et utile pour 
éclairer la profession.  
Les contrôles de l’ACPR ne se limitent toutefois pas à un traitement au cas par cas des 
mauvaises pratiques constatées. Ils permettent d’identifier des problèmes plus généraux qui 
appellent une évolution des pratiques du marché, voire des réglementations. Quelques 
exemples seront développés ce matin pour illustrer les enseignements que nous retirons de 
leurs contrôles. Ainsi les services de l’ACPR ont-ils examiné ces chaînes de distribution où 
de nombreux intermédiaires s’intercalent entre le client et le producteur (banquier ou, plus 
souvent, assureur). Les questions que nous posons aujourd’hui sont simples. Mais elles sont 
importantes pour l’ensemble du secteur. Tous les intermédiaires apportent-ils une valeur 
ajoutée au client ? Comment garantir, pour le client, la fiabilité et l’efficacité de la chaîne, 
quelle que soit son organisation ? 
Pour faire évoluer les pratiques, l’ACPR dispose également d’un outil de droit souple, la 
recommandation. Elle me paraît un instrument préventif utile. La recommandation a pour 
objet de modifier ou d’orienter les comportements des professionnels. Elle les aide à 
identifier et à prendre en compte de manière concrète ce qui est attendu en matière de 
protection de la clientèle. 
De façon plus générale, le domaine des pratiques commerciales est un domaine où il est 
tout à fait envisageable qu’une partie des bonnes pratiques soient définies par les acteurs 
eux-mêmes. Cela doit se faire dans la concertation et sous la forme d’engagements 
suffisamment contraignants pour être contrôlés. Pour citer un bon exemple, la convention 
AERAS [s'assurer et emprunter avec un risque aggravé de santé] en est un bon exemple et 
4 
 
je tiens à remercier M. Emmanuel Constans, président de la Commission de médiation 
AERAS et membre du collège de l’ACPR, d’avoir accepté l’invitation à présenter aujourd’hui 
les évolutions de cette convention. 
 
III/ Enfin, notre mission de contrôle des pratiques commerciales doit de plus en plus 
intégrer les évolutions européennes et technologiques. 
Il me paraît important, non seulement pour l’Autorité mais aussi pour le marché, d’anticiper le 
plus possible ces évolutions.  
Les textes européens récents ou en cours d’adoption poussent en premier lieu à une 
standardisation de l’information donnée au client. C’est le cas du règlement relatif aux 
Produits d’investissement de détail packagés (PRIIPS), et des directives « crédit immobilier » 
en banque (MCD), ou « distribution » en assurance (IDD). C’est aussi, dans le champ de 
l’AMF –avec qui nous avons un pôle commun efficace de contrôle des pratiques 
commerciales–, la directive MIFID sur les instruments financiers. 
Les textes européens opèrent ensuite une refonte des obligations du distributeur de produits 
en intégrant notamment la notion de service de conseil dans les directives sectorielles. Ils 
refondent en parallèle les obligations du producteur en imposant un processus d’élaboration 
des produits qui tienne compte des intérêts et caractéristiques de la clientèle visée. Enfin, 
d’importants travaux sur les sujets, difficiles, de rémunération des commerciaux et des 
salariés devraient aboutir dans les mois à venir.  
S’agissant des dernières évolutions européennes, et non des moindres,  en matière de 
pratiques commerciales, l’effort d’homogénéisation des règles dans le cadre d’une approche 
trans-sectorielle poursuit un objectif de simplification. Il mérite d’être partagé. Je pense 
évidemment au document clé d’information du règlement PRIIPS. Il permettra au client de 
comparer aisément deux produits d’épargne, quelle que soit leur classification (produit 
bancaire, d’assurance ou instrument financier). Mais je pourrais également citer les travaux 
en matière de « gouvernance produits », de conflits d’intérêt ou de rémunération, qui 
rapprochent les réglementations des trois secteurs. 
Je termine par les évolutions liées aux nouvelles technologies, nous en sommes tous 
conscients, elles modifient les pratiques commerciales en affectant les modes de 
consommation et la relation avec le client. L’activité des services bancaires et d’assurance 
se caractérise par la richesse, et souvent la durée, des échanges issus des relations 
contractuelles. Ces échanges reposent sur les concepts de consentement des deux parties 
au contrat et d’exécution en confiance. Aujourd’hui, au-delà de l’accord sur la chose et le prix 
5 
 
qui forme le contrat de vente, entrent de plus en plus en ligne de compte l’utilisation possible 
et la sécurité des données des clients.  
Le développement des nouvelles technologies et l’apparition de nouveaux outils, destinés à 
rendre plus fluides ou attractifs les « parcours clients », doivent également être appréhendés 
à l’aune du principe cardinal de protection de la clientèle. C’est la condition de l’émergence 
de nouveaux modèles économiques maîtrisés et durables. 
Ces sujets constituent aujourd’hui les principaux axes de réflexion des autorités nationales et 
européennes et l’ACPR est prête à y prendre toute sa part, sur la base de son expérience et 
des échanges qu’elle mène avec les parties intéressées. 
Je laisse maintenant la parole à Patrick Montagner et aux équipes de l’ACPR pour revenir 
sur certains de ces aspects et vous souhaite une excellente conférence. Merci de votre 
attention.

Paris Europlace Forum financier international - Tokyo, 5 décembre 2016 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
• Je vous remercie de votre invitation. Je suis très heureux d'être à Tokyo, 
pour la première fois en tant que gouverneur. La France et le Japon ont 
beaucoup en commun. Nos deux pays disposent d’une histoire et d’une 
culture séculaires, d’une vision à long terme et d’un solide partenariat entre 
le privé et le public. En outre, la Banque du Japon et la Banque de France 
ont développé une relation riche et fructueuse. Je souhaite remercier M. le 
gouverneur Kuroda pour ses commentaires éclairés à propos de 
l'innovation digitale et des FinTechs, que la Banque de France soutient 
résolument. Je mettrai l'accent, pour ma part, sur les défis économiques 
auxquels l'Europe doit faire face. 
• En 2016, le monde en général, et l'Europe en particulier, a connu une 
période de forte incertitude : incertitude liée à notre sécurité, avec la 
menace des attentats ; incertitude politique, avec le Brexit et, plus 
récemment, la victoire de M. Trump aux États-Unis ; et incertitude 
économique également, avec notamment les prix du pétrole ou la 
croissance en Chine, ainsi qu'une forte volatilité sur les marchés en début 
d'année. Le référendum qui a eu lieu en Italie hier peut être considéré 
comme une autre source d'incertitude. On ne peut toutefois pas le 
comparer au référendum britannique : le peuple italien a été appelé aux 
urnes pour se prononcer sur une question constitutionnelle d’ordre national 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
et non pas sur l'appartenance de longue date de l'Italie à l'Union 
européenne. Néanmoins, nous en suivrons de près les conséquences. 
• Au-delà des incertitudes, nous avons également reçu des nouvelles 
positives ; en particulier, la reprise est en marche en Europe. Comme vous 
le savez probablement, une réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE 
va avoir lieu dans trois jours, je dois donc respecter une période de réserve 
sur les questions de politique monétaire. En revanche, je peux souligner le 
fait que l'Eurosystème, dont la Banque de France est membre, a pris des 
mesures décisives en réponse à une inflation faible et au regain de 
l'incertitude. En outre, plusieurs pays européens ont mis en œuvre des 
réformes structurelles depuis le début de la crise et, dans le même temps, 
l'UE et la zone euro ont pris d'importantes mesures pour renforcer 
l'intégration et la stabilité économiques et financières. Tous ces efforts ont 
contribué à accroître la capacité de résistance de la zone euro, comme en 
témoignent la réaction limitée au Brexit ou aux élections aux États-Unis, ou 
encore le fait que la reprise n’ait pas été affectée et se poursuive 
régulièrement dans la zone euro. 
 
1/ Évolution des conditions économiques 
• [diapo 2] En Europe, la reprise économique est en cours. L'activité 
économique continue de se redresser, au rythme de 1,7 % en 2016, et 
cette évolution devrait se poursuivre en 2017. La croissance dans la zone 
euro est robuste car elle est soutenue par la demande intérieure, 
c'est-à-dire par la consommation privée et par l'investissement des 
entreprises. De nouvelles projections plus détaillées concernant la 
croissance et l'inflation de la zone euro seront publiées le 8 décembre.  
• Il est particulièrement important de souligner que la situation sur le marché 
du travail s'améliore et que le chômage diminue. Dans la zone euro, au 
cours des quatre dernières années, le taux de chômage est revenu de 
13 % à 9,8 % en octobre dernier, son plus bas niveau en quatre ans. Il est 
encore trop élevé mais il évolue dans la bonne direction. 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
• En ce qui concerne la France, après une croissance du PIB de 1,2 % 
en 2015, ce taux devrait être plus élevé en 2016 et en 2017. À court terme, 
la croissance devrait être de 0,4 % au dernier trimestre 2016. Le 
9 décembre, la Banque de France publiera ses nouvelles projections de 
croissance et d'inflation pour la France. 
 
Évolutions de l'inflation 
• [diapo 3] L'inflation en zone euro, qui était proche de zéro en 2015, a 
augmenté de façon régulière en 2016 : elle devrait atteindre 0,6 % en 
novembre. La politique monétaire a contribué à cette hausse et continuera 
de soutenir l'évolution de l'inflation vers l'objectif de l'Eurosystème, soit un 
taux d'inflation inférieur à, mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme. En outre, 
les prix du pétrole ont atteint leur niveau le plus bas au début de l'année 
avant de repartir à la hausse, ce qui devrait directement contribuer à une 
hausse de l'inflation au-delà de 1 % au cours des premiers mois de 2017.  
• [diapo 4] L’ensemble de mesures adopté le 10 mars 2016 a accentué 
l'orientation accommodante de la politique monétaire de la zone euro. Ces 
mesures ont notamment la particularité d'être axées sur le financement de 
l'économie réelle. La deuxième série d'opérations de refinancement ciblées 
(dites TLTRO 2), dont le montant alloué jusqu'à présent s'élève à 
444,6 milliards d'euros, devrait continuer d'améliorer les conditions de 
financement à moyen terme pour les banques et encourager les prêts 
bancaires aux entreprises et aux ménages.  
 
2/ Politiques structurelles  
• Des progrès ont également été accomplis en matière de réformes 
structurelles. Plusieurs pays européens, notamment l’Allemagne et 
l’Espagne, montrent la voie à l’Europe. Ils ont réussi à mener à bien des 
réformes de grande ampleur compatibles avec notre modèle social 
européen commun, qui combine des normes élevées de service public et 
des niveaux relativement faibles d’inégalités (beaucoup plus faibles que 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
dans la société américaine). Des progrès ont été réalisés dans les quatre 
principaux domaines : l’Entreprise, l’Emploi, l’Éducation et l’État (réduction 
des dépenses publiques). Et ces réformes donnent des 
résultats aujourd’hui : ces dernières années, le PIB et l’emploi ont 
progressé beaucoup plus vite dans ces pays.  
• Contrairement aux idées reçues, la France a déjà démontré par le passé sa 
capacité à relever le défi des réformes économiques et sociales. Dans les 
années quatre-vingt-dix, afin de préparer l’introduction de l’euro, la France 
a mené une politique de « désinflation compétitive » qui s’est révélée 
hautement efficace. Il convient de rappeler que, à la fin des années 
quatre-vingt-dix, la France connaissait le taux de croissance du PIB le plus 
élevé et le taux d’inflation le plus bas parmi les pays européens, et que son 
taux de chômage baissait significativement. Aujourd’hui, les réformes 
françaises vont dans la bonne direction, [diapo 5] en particulier le crédit 
d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi (CICE) et le Pacte de responsabilité 
et de solidarité (PRS) conçus pour favoriser l’amélioration de la 
compétitivité de l’économie française. Nous devons évidemment 
persévérer en adoptant davantage de réformes. Mais des progrès ont 
également été réalisés avec la récente loi sur le travail (« Loi El Khomri »), 
qui clarifie notamment les conditions dans lesquelles les entreprises 
peuvent effectuer des licenciements pour des raisons économiques.  
• De plus, la France dispose, dans le secteur financier, d’atouts que nous ne 
devons pas oublier : des banques et des sociétés d’assurance robustes 
(qui ont traversé la crise sans apport d’argent public à l’exception du cas 
très particulier de Dexia), un secteur de la gestion d’actifs dynamique, des 
infrastructures de marchés financiers solides et une main-d’œuvre 
hautement qualifiée. Et les autorités françaises, dont la Banque de France, 
attachent la plus grande importance à faire de Paris l’une des places 
financières les plus solides et les plus attractives d’Europe, encore 
davantage après le Brexit. Vous parliez du Brexit ce matin. Il est trop tôt 
pour dire quel sera précisément le choix du gouvernement britannique, 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
mais un principe s’impose : si les Britanniques souhaitent maintenir un 
accès complet au marché unique européen, ils devront en appliquer toutes 
les règles. Il ne peut pas y avoir d’Europe « à la carte » (cherry-picking), ni 
de « passager clandestin » (free-riding). Et si la Grande-Bretagne 
choisissait un « Brexit dur », cela signifierait en particulier la fin du 
passeport européen pour la City de Londres. Vous pouvez être sûrs que la 
zone euro sera alors une des zones financières les plus intégrées du 
monde : nous disposons d’une monnaie commune solide, nous avons 
d’importantes ressources d’épargne, nous avons déjà une Union bancaire 
et plusieurs centres financiers importants, à commencer par Paris. Il est 
clair que nous ne souhaitions pas le Brexit, mais nous sommes désormais 
prêts à accueillir les institutions financières japonaises ; mon prédécesseur 
Christian Noyer s’est vu confier cette mission par le gouvernement français 
et est déjà venu deux fois à Tokyo ces derniers mois pour relayer ce 
message très concret. 
 
3/ Comment pouvons-nous donner un nouvel élan à l’Europe ?  
• Pour en revenir au niveau européen, j’aimerais faire remarquer que de 
nombreuses améliorations ont également été apportées dans le domaine 
de la prévention et de la gestion des crises. La prévention se fonde sur une 
réglementation financière beaucoup plus efficace et sur un cadre de 
gouvernance européen qui est mieux organisé maintenant, avec des 
mécanismes bien conçus permettant de surveiller la performance 
budgétaire, les déséquilibres macro-économiques et les réformes 
structurelles. L’Union bancaire contribue à renforcer la stabilité financière 
dans la zone euro et l’ensemble de l’UE et à garantir la sécurité et la 
fiabilité du secteur bancaire. Le tableau global au niveau européen est celui 
d’une plus grande solidité depuis la crise. Les ratios de fonds propres de 
base durs (CET 1) des groupes bancaires importants de la zone euro sont 
passés de 7 % en 2008 à 14 % aujourd’hui. La gestion des crises, y 
compris pour la Grèce, a également considérablement évolué avec la 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
création du MES. Vous pouvez donc avoir pleinement confiance quant à la 
résilience de l’euro et de la zone euro. Il ne s’agit pas seulement d’un atout 
économique, mais également d’un atout politique, soutenu par chacun des 
19 gouvernements et, ce qui est encore plus important, par 68 % des 
citoyens de la zone euro (et même par 70 % des citoyens français et 73 % 
des citoyens allemands). 
• De plus, la politique monétaire a joué pleinement son rôle de maintien de la 
cohésion de la zone euro. L’Europe a clairement réussi l’union monétaire, 
mais la politique monétaire ne doit pas rester la seule partie jouée. Nous 
devons continuer de progresser sur la voie de l’union économique pour 
aller plus loin et unir davantage nos forces dans le nouveau contexte 
international. Pour ce faire, l’Europe doit saisir l’opportunité de progresser 
en trois étapes concrètes vers l’Union économique : 
• La première étape, dès aujourd’hui, consiste à construire une « Union de 
financement et d’investissement » (UFI) afin de diriger l’épargne abondante 
vers l’investissement productif. Les ressources ne manquent pas : dans la 
zone euro, l’excédent du compte courant, qui est une mesure du surplus 
d’épargne par rapport à l’investissement, est supérieur à 3 % du PIB. Cette 
tendance est souvent décrite comme une « surabondance d’épargne », 
mais je pense qu’il est plus juste de parler de « pénurie d’investissement » 
[diapo 6], car nous manquons d’investissement productif. L’UFI 
regrouperait les initiatives déjà en place : l’Union des marchés de capitaux 
bien sûr, mais aussi le Plan d’investissements « Juncker » – qui vise à 
générer, en s’appuyant sur des garanties publiques limitées, des 
investissements privés pour un montant total de 630 milliards d’euros sur 
six ans –, et l’Union bancaire. Nous devons mettre les pièces du puzzle en 
place afin d’en amplifier l’impact par des synergies, avec deux objectifs : 
[diapo 7] une plus grande diversification du financement des entreprises – 
avec davantage de financement par fonds propres – et une plus grande 
résilience de la zone euro grâce au partage privé des risques au-delà des 
frontières nationales.  
Page 7 sur 7 
 
• [diapo 8] La deuxième étape, après l’UFI, est une stratégie économique 
collective pour la zone euro. La croissance et l’emploi seront plus forts en 
Europe si nous combinons davantage de réformes là où elles sont 
nécessaires, comme en France et en Italie, et davantage de soutien 
budgétaire dans les pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre, comme 
l’Allemagne. En pratique, pour que cette stratégie économique collective 
puisse exister, la zone euro a besoin d’une institution qui favorise la 
confiance : cela pourrait être un « ministre des Finances » de la zone euro.  
• La troisième étape, à plus long terme, serait une capacité budgétaire 
européenne. Elle arrive en dernier car elle nécessite une plus grande 
convergence et une plus grande confiance. Un véritable budget au niveau 
de la zone euro constituerait un instrument de stabilisation et pourrait 
comprendre, par exemple, un dispositif d’assurance chômage à l’échelle de 
la zone euro. Il pourrait également servir à financer certains « biens publics 
européens » tels que la technologie numérique, la transition énergétique ou 
l’intégration des réfugiés. Et à long terme, il pourrait directement émettre 
une dette commune et même lever des impôts.  
** 
En résumé, depuis le début de la crise, l’Europe a été capable de se renforcer 
et de construire un ensemble d’instruments et de mécanismes qui ont 
augmenté sa résilience de manière significative (l’Union bancaire, le MES, le 
PSC renforcé, etc.). Il s’agit à présent de continuer à progresser et de ne pas 
voir le Brexit comme un choc pour la zone euro, mais plutôt comme une 
opportunité de poursuivre, de manière structurée, la mise en place d’une 
meilleure Union économique. Et au cœur de l’Europe, la France a fait des 
progrès, qu’il faut accélérer. Mais, dans un monde incertain, la France 
apparaît comme un pays assez stable, au vu de la résilience de son 
économie, de la robustesse de son secteur financier ainsi que de la solidité de 
ses institutions politiques.

Les rencontres de la régulation financière de l’AGEFI – 6 décembre 2016 
François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France,  
Président de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution 
Bâle 3 : un bilan, une perspective 
 
Notre rencontre ce soir ne saurait tomber plus opportunément : nous sommes dans une période 
charnière pour la réforme de Bâle 3, huit jours après la réunion du Comité de Bâle au Chili, un 
mois avant la réunion décisive du GHOS (Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision). Nous 
avons commencé à écrire cette nouvelle page de la réglementation bancaire très rapidement 
après la crise financière. Huit ans sont désormais passés depuis la crise Lehman. Il est plus que 
temps de mettre un point final à ce chapitre réglementaire, pour se concentrer sur la mise en 
œuvre et la supervision, et pour donner de la stabilité et de la prévisibilité à l’industrie financière et 
par là à l’économie. Mais avant de détailler les perspectives pour les semaines à venir – ce que 
vous attendez sans doute de moi ce soir –, il faut dresser le bilan des mesures du paquet Bâle 3 
déjà adoptées : il est considérable, et il est positif.  
 
 
I. La réforme de Bâle 3 était absolument indispensable après la crise 
 
Personne, je l’espère, ne peut contester sérieusement – y compris parmi l’industrie bancaire, et y 
compris outre-Atlantique – qu’après la crise financière il fallait renforcer significativement la 
régulation pour diminuer les risques. La crise financière a eu de lourds coûts économiques, 
sociaux à travers le drame du chômage, budgétaires ; ses conséquences politiques dans nos 
démocraties se voient encore aujourd’hui. Nous devons tous souhaiter, et agir pour, une meilleure 
prévention des risques futurs : c’est un impératif collectif. Un travail remarquable a été accompli 
depuis 2009 sous l’impulsion du G20 et du Conseil de stabilité financière. Bâle 3 est une réforme 
très complète qui est venue renforcer de manière significative le dispositif prudentiel pour les 
banques et la stabilité financière [slide 2]. Au-delà des toutes dernières mesures du paquet Bâle 3 
encore en discussion, de grands progrès ont d’ores et déjà été actés : 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
 
 
<U+F0B7> D’abord, en relevant les exigences en fonds propres, Bâle 3 a rendu le système financier 
beaucoup plus solide qu’avant la crise. Les banques ont désormais davantage de fonds 
propres, et des fonds propres de meilleure qualité. [slide 3] Pour prendre l’exemple de la 
France, les grands groupes bancaires ont plus que doublé leurs fonds propres durs entre 2008 
et 2015, de 132 à 275 milliards d’euros au total. L’amélioration de la solvabilité s’est faite pour 
l’essentiel par l’augmentation du capital, plutôt que par diminution des actifs moyens pondérés 
–  c’est-à-dire des financements à l’économie. 
<U+F0B7> Ensuite, Bâle 3 a élargi la réglementation bancaire au-delà des ratios de solvabilité, pour 
prendre en compte la diversité des risques auxquels les banques sont exposées. Un ratio de 
levier – par rapport au total du bilan non pondéré – a été introduit. Deux nouveaux ratios de 
liquidité viennent également compléter l’arsenal réglementaire : le LCR (Liquidity Coverage 
Ratio) encadre la liquidité à court terme, le NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) la structure de 
refinancement. Les banques françaises s’y sont d’ailleurs déjà adaptées [slide 4] : elles ont 
presque doublé leurs réserves de liquidité depuis 2011 et respectent dès à présent largement 
l’exigence de LCR, qui ne sera pleinement contraignante qu’en 2018.  
<U+F0B7> Enfin, Bâle 3 permet de répondre plus efficacement aux problématiques de stabilité financière 
en prévoyant des outils dédiés, tels que les coussins de fonds propres contracycliques, ou 
pour les établissements systémiques. La France a parallèlement créé depuis 2013 le Haut 
Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF), apte à prendre des mesures macroprudentielles ; le 
HCSF a son équivalent européen avec l’ESRB (Comité européen du risque systémique ou 
CERS). Et le nouveau régime de résolution bancaire européen est maintenant entré 
entièrement en vigueur.  
 
Une question est néanmoins souvent posée : quel est l’impact économique de ces nouvelles 
règles ? Risquent-elles de contraindre excessivement le financement de l’économie et donc de 
peser sur la croissance ? Je crois souhaitable que dans la durée, nous nous dotions d’instruments 
d’évaluation ex post de ces effets économiques : le Conseil de stabilité financière y travaille, sur la 
base d’une pluralité de méthodes et en incluant les bénéfices liés à une moindre probabilité des 
crises. Nous en avons parlé à notre réunion de Londres le 17 novembre. Mais aujourd’hui, 
personne ne peut dire sérieusement que l’offre de crédit en France ou en Europe est contrainte 
par les ratios prudentiels. Il n’y a pas eu de renchérissement du coût du crédit, bien au contraire, et 
la croissance du crédit à l’économie est particulièrement robuste en France, à + 4,6 % pour les 
crédits aux entreprises et + 4,1 % pour les ménages en octobre 2016 [slide 5]. La politique 
monétaire accommodante de l’Eurosystème y a certes contribué, en favorisant une situation de 
surliquidité des banques européennes. Pour l’avenir, en revanche, la question peut se poser. Dans 
la phase de finalisation de la réforme de Bâle 3, nous devons impérativement éviter cet écueil.  
 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
 
 
  
II. La finalisation de Bâle 3 doit préserver à la fois la sécurité financière et la capacité 
des banques européennes à financer l’économie réelle 
 
Nous sommes désormais presque au terme du chantier Bâle 3. Les derniers travaux en cours 
portent essentiellement sur la mesure des risques au bilan des banques. Au-delà des questions 
techniques qu’ils soulèvent, il y a deux enjeux fondamentaux qui conditionnent le bon achèvement 
des travaux. 
  
Premier enjeu : la place des modèles internes dans le dispositif prudentiel d’évaluation des 
risques. Sur ce sujet, nous ne devons pas nous tromper de cible. Oui, il est important de limiter la 
variabilité des résultats entre banques et entre pays, mais seulement si cette variabilité est non 
justifiée. Plusieurs études ont souligné les différences qui existent entre les banques européennes 
et américaines : ces dernières ont des actifs pondérés des risques (risk weighted assets ou RWA) 
plus élevés en moyenne, rapportés au total des actifs non pondérés – ce qu’on appelle la densité. 
Toutefois, il ne faut pas en tirer de conclusions simplistes [slide 6]. Les variations observées entre 
l’Europe et les États-Unis ne sont pas dues à la seule utilisation des modèles internes plutôt que 
de l’approche standard. Il faut aussi prendre en compte la nature très différente des bilans 
bancaires, du fait notamment d’un recours plus large à la titrisation – notamment pour les crédits 
immobiliers – et aux financements de marché aux États-Unis, ainsi que de règles comptables 
parfois différentes. Il faut bien sûr conforter la confiance dans les modèles internes en les 
supervisant étroitement – l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) depuis 
longtemps, et le Mécanisme de Supervision Unique (MSU) à Francfort aujourd’hui, s’y emploient – 
; mais cela ne doit pas se faire au prix d’une uniformisation à outrance. La sensibilité au risque doit 
être conservée car c’est une grande avancée de Bâle 3 : elle permet de garantir la proportionnalité 
des exigences par rapport aux risques pris. Vous voyez [slide 6-3] que la corrélation entre les 
risques pondérés et le coût du risque est forte aussi en Europe : cela confirme le fait que la 
différence des risques pondérés entre zones géographiques s’explique en grande partie par des 
profils de risque différents. Il s’agit donc bien de finaliser Bâle 3, et non de construire un nouveau 
Bâle 4 tant dénoncé par certains.  
 
Deuxième enjeu : l’impact des nouvelles règles prudentielles et, en fin de compte, leur efficacité 
au regard des objectifs recherchés. Il ne s’agit plus de renforcer systématiquement les fonds 
propres. Les ajustements qui s’imposaient en la matière ont, comme je l’ai dit, largement été faits. 
Une hausse générale supplémentaire n’est pas justifiée en termes de stabilité financière, et elle 
pourrait, cette fois, entraver le bon financement de l’économie. C’est particulièrement le cas en 
Europe en raison du rôle crucial de l’intermédiation bancaire pour l’économie. Certes, certaines 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
 
 
banques pourront voir leurs exigences évoluer à la hausse, dès lors que cela découlera d’un 
ajustement justifié de certains paramètres de leurs modèles internes. Il faut en outre garder à 
l’esprit que certaines mesures de renforcement du cadre prudentiel ont été adoptées récemment et 
doivent encore être mises en œuvre – je pense en particulier à la revue fondamentale du 
portefeuille de négociation, c’est-à-dire au traitement des risques de marché.  
Les dirigeants du G20 ont réaffirmé à plusieurs reprises l’objectif général de ne pas aboutir à une 
« augmentation significative des exigences globales en fonds propres » : ils l’ont fait à Shanghai 
en février, à Washington en avril, à Hangzhou en septembre. Le Comité de Bâle doit bien sûr 
respecter le mandat qui lui a été donné. 
 
Au regard de ces deux enjeux, les propositions initiales que le Comité de Bâle avait publiées au 
premier semestre 2016 n’étaient pas acceptables, je l’avais dit. Elles avaient un impact excessif et 
elles étaient en outre, à certains égards, techniquement discutables. Toutefois, des progrès 
significatifs ont été obtenus depuis l’été, puis lors de la réunion de Santiago. Il y a fallu une 
détermination sans faille des négociateurs français, une forte cohésion de la zone euro – et en 
particulier du duo franco-allemand –, et un gros travail technique des équipes de l’ACPR et de la 
Banque de France que vous me permettrez de saluer. 
 
Nous ne sommes pas encore à un accord. Mais les contours d’une finalisation possible de la 
réforme Bâle 3 sont désormais plus clairs. Ils incluent notamment :  
<U+F0B7> Le maintien de la sensibilité aux risques du cadre prudentiel, avec certains portefeuilles qui 
resteront finalement éligibles aux modèles internes. En outre, des paramètres techniques 
excessifs ont été supprimés lors de la dernière réunion du Comité de Bâle, à la fois pour le 
risque de crédit et le risque opérationnel.  
<U+F0B7> L’assimilation des crédits cautionnés aux crédits hypothécaires : cela constitue une avancée 
majeure pour les banques françaises et devrait réduire les exigences sur ces portefeuilles. Le 
crédit immobilier en France est donc conforté, et non menacé. 
 
Cependant, nous ne sommes pas encore au bout du processus :  
<U+F0B7> nombre de détails doivent être précisés, et le traitement adéquat des financements spécialisés 
(pour les équipements et les grands projets) doit être durablement sécurisé.  
<U+F0B7> le principe comme le calibrage d’un « output floor » – l’éventuelle introduction d’une exigence 
plancher de fonds propres pour les modèles internes, en pourcentage de l’approche standard – 
sont encore en débat vif.  
La Banque de France et l’ACPR vont rester pleinement vigilantes jusqu’à la conclusion des travaux 
avec nos partenaires européens. Et dès lors qu’un accord serait obtenu, il est clair que sa 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
 
 
transposition future en Europe devra être liée à son respect aussi dans les autres grandes zones 
géographiques, y compris les États-Unis d’Amérique et leur administration à venir. 
** 
 
Je veux terminer avec une conviction. Pourvu qu’il soit équilibré, l’obtention d’un accord final sur la 
réforme de Bâle 3 serait dans notre intérêt à tous : dans l’intérêt des banques, qui ont besoin que 
l’incertitude réglementaire soit levée – celle-ci pèse aujourd’hui sur leur stratégie comme sur leur 
valorisation boursière – ; dans l’intérêt des entreprises et des ménages, qui pourraient compter sur 
des financements stabilisés ; dans l’intérêt de la France et de l’Europe également, pour conserver 
au plan mondial des règles communes, gages d’un bon fonctionnement du système financier 
international et d’un traitement équitable de tous ses acteurs. S’il est encore trop tôt pour être 
affirmatif, car il reste des points importants, je suis à ce stade plus confiant sur la possibilité 
d’aboutir, d’ici le début de l’année prochaine, à cet accord décisif. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Conférence de la Banque de France et du CNPS 
«Technological innovations in payments and beyond» 
 (Les innovations technologiques dans les paiements et au-delà) 
6 janvier 2017 
 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir à Paris, pour cette conférence sur les innovations 
technologiques dans les paiements et, de façon plus générale, dans le système financier. Les 
représentants d’un grand nombre de parties prenantes, allant des intervenants de marché aux 
régulateurs, sont présents aujourd’hui et je suis convaincu que cette diversité des participants 
permettra des discussions fructueuses. Avant de laisser la parole aux intervenants et aux 
panélistes, je voudrais partager avec vous trois réflexions concernant les défis posés par la 
digitalisation, du point de vue d’un banquier central.  
 
1. Les innovations technologiques ouvrent de nouvelles opportunités pour les paiements, 
susceptibles de profiter à l’ensemble de l’économie. 
 
Les paiements sont souvent considérés comme une activité très technique et accessoire, et 
parfois même comme une simple affaire de « tuyauterie ». Et pourtant, ils ont une importance 
fondamentale pour notre économie et pour les banques centrales. S’agissant de la Banque de 
France, les paiements sont essentiels pour chacune de nos trois missions, ce que nous appelons 
les « 3 S » : la stratégie monétaire, la stabilité financière et le service à l’économie.  
<U+F0B7> En premier lieu, la stratégie monétaire : ce qui est en jeu avec les paiements, c’est l’avenir de la 
monnaie. Les banques centrales sont nées au moment de la création de la monnaie fiduciaire 
- 2 - 
(les billets) et elles ont joué un rôle essentiel dans l’adoption des instruments de paiement 
scripturaux. Parmi ceux-ci, on a observé ces dernières années une prépondérance croissante 
des paiements électroniques par rapport aux paiements traditionnels sur support papier 
(comme les chèques), même si cette tendance est variable selon les zones. Cette 
dématérialisation physique se poursuit avec le passage progressif de supports physiques 
dédiés (tels que les cartes en plastique) à des supports entièrement dématérialisés (par 
exemple, des solutions intégrées dans les smartphones ou d’autres appareils grand public). 
Ainsi, concernant les conditions d’émission de monnaie, nous devons surveiller de près les 
dernières innovations technologiques. Plusieurs banques centrales, notamment la plus 
ancienne (la Riksbank de Suède), ont commencé à étudier la possibilité d’une monnaie de 
banque centrale émise de façon digitale, qui permettrait non seulement aux banques 
commerciales, mais également au grand public, d’avoir accès à la monnaie de banque centrale. 
<U+F0B7> En deuxième lieu, la stabilité financière : les paiements constituent un vecteur essentiel pour la 
confiance dans le fonctionnement adéquat du système financier. Cela nécessite des paiements 
et des infrastructures financières à la fois sûrs et efficaces. En conséquence, les régulateurs 
attachent une grande importance au soutien des innovations technologiques, notamment via le 
développement potentiel d’une réglementation plus efficace (« Regtechs »), tant qu’elles restent 
compatibles avec de faibles risques opérationnels et une sécurité élevée des transactions.  
<U+F0B7> En troisième lieu, les services à l’économie : les paiements constituent le noyau à partir duquel 
un nouvel écosystème basé sur l’innovation technologique et sur l’entrepreneuriat se 
développe. Ces évolutions profitent à l’économie réelle (et plus particulièrement au secteur des 
entreprises) en France et en Europe : une multitude de « Fintechs » commencent à apparaître. 
Elles rivalisent avec les acteurs déjà en place, notamment aux États-Unis, en proposant non 
seulement de nouveaux moyens de paiement mais également de nouveaux services liés aux 
paiements (tels que l’agrégation des comptes). Les enjeux industriels sont donc importants et 
nous devons favoriser une concurrence active, largement préférable aux monopoles, même 
technologiques. 
 
Compte tenu de l’importance des paiements pour de nombreux aspects de notre économie, nous 
devons adopter une stratégie d’ensemble. Plus important encore, l’innovation doit être stimulée, 
qu’elle soit issue des start-ups ou d’entreprises plus anciennes. C’est exactement l’objectif de la 
stratégie nationale pour les paiements de détail – en ligne avec le cadre européen. Cette stratégie 
française a été développée l’an dernier en France par le biais d’un processus coopératif : elle vise 
à moderniser les paiements, en s’appuyant sur la dématérialisation des processus dans différents 
domaines (e-facturation, e-mandats pour les prélèvements SEPA, portefeuilles virtuels, etc.). La 
mise en œuvre de cette stratégie a été confiée au Comité national des paiements scripturaux 
(CNPS), co-organisateur de cette conférence, qui réunit des représentants des secteurs de l’offre 
et de la demande et qui est présidé par la Banque de France.   
 
 
3 
 
 
Au-delà de la seule sphère des paiements, l’innovation dans le secteur financier peut générer des 
bénéfices considérables dont il convient de tirer profit. Elle est capable de favoriser l’inclusion 
financière dans le monde entier, à condition que les personnes disposent d’un accès à internet. 
Elle incite également les entreprises en place à s’adapter, les poussant à développer de nouveaux 
modèles et de nouvelles activités qui bénéficient en définitive aux consommateurs. À cet égard, je 
voudrais souligner les initiatives visant à développer les paiements instantanés dans la zone 
SEPA, à faciliter le financement de marché et le financement par actions au sein de l’Union 
européenne. J’aimerais également mentionner le fait que la Banque de France conduit ses 
propres expérimentations, avec la création récente d’un Laboratoire et la nomination d’un 
Directeur de la transformation digitale, Thierry Bedoin, qui animera la première table ronde de la 
séance de cet après-midi.  
 
2. L’innovation technologique doit être saluée mais ses risques ne doivent pas être 
sous-estimés 
 
L’innovation génère pour le système financier de nouvelles menaces, qu’il convient de gérer avec 
prudence :  
<U+F0B7> premièrement, elle pose des problèmes en termes de fraude et de sécurité, en raison de la 
multiplication des acteurs intervenant dans les processus financiers et de paiement, de la plus 
grande circulation de données personnelles ainsi que de la multiplication de « points de 
défaillance » potentiels. Ces nouveaux « cyber » risques suscitent une vive inquiétude dans 
l’ensemble du secteur, y compris pour une technologie éprouvée comme celle des paiements 
par carte sur internet, à l’origine de plus des deux tiers de l’ensemble des fraudes liées aux 
paiements par carte en France. A fortiori, les technologies plus récentes qui n’ont pas encore 
été testées, comme la technologie blockchain, sont susceptibles d’engendrer de nouveaux 
risques de sécurité qui méritent une surveillance précoce et prolongée.  
<U+F0B7> deuxièmement, l’innovation technologique pourrait menacer la stabilité financière sur le long 
terme, en raison du processus d’automatisation accrue que nous observons depuis quelques 
années. Le développement du trading à haute fréquence, par exemple, – dont l’utilité 
économique est d’ailleurs contestable – pourrait nuire à la capacité de résistance des marchés 
financiers en période de tensions. De nouveaux services, tels que les « contrats intelligents » 
(smart contracts) intégrés à une blockchain, pourraient créer de nouveaux mécanismes de 
transmission des chocs ou de nouvelles formes d’interdépendance ou de procyclicité et, donc, 
être une source potentielle d’instabilité financière. 
- 4 - 
<U+F0B7> Troisièmement, l’innovation technologique pourrait menacer l’intégration des marchés, 
notamment en Europe où les efforts pour renforcer l’harmonisation entre marchés financiers ont 
été considérables ces dix dernières années. Ces efforts sont manifestes dans le domaine des 
marchés de titres, avec le récent lancement en 2015 de la plateforme Target2-Titres (Target2-
Securities), et dans celui des paiements, avec la réalisation en 2016 de la deuxième étape du 
projet SEPA qui a permis l’harmonisation totale, dans l’ensemble de l’Union européenne, des 
virements et des prélèvements directs libellés en euros. En revanche, la profusion actuelle de 
nouvelles technologies, de normes et de protocoles qui ne sont pas totalement interopérables, 
du moins à ce stade, constitue un risque potentiel de fragmentation des marchés. De plus, elle 
pourrait aboutir à une certaine fragmentation sociale si les nouveaux moyens de paiement sont 
moins accessibles aux plus démunis. 
 
3. Dans ce contexte, les autorités publiques jouent un rôle clé pour permettre de tirer 
pleinement profit de l’innovation tout en prévenant les menaces qu’elle génère. 
 
Cela implique dans un premier temps de repenser la réglementation de manière à parvenir au 
juste équilibre entre innovation et sécurité. Plusieurs objectifs doivent en effet être atteints : 
maximiser les retombées des innovations, protéger le consommateur et traiter les questions de 
stabilité financière, et veiller à ce que l’innovation profite à l’ensemble des parties, en particulier 
sous la forme de nouveaux services et de réduction des coûts. Cet équilibre ne pourra être atteint 
qu’au moyen de règles adéquates et proportionnées, fondées sur le profil de risque du service 
fourni et non sur la nature ou le statut juridique du fournisseur. C’est sur ce principe que les 
autorités européennes se sont appuyées pour le réexamen de la directive sur les services de 
paiement, qui fera l’objet d’un débat approfondi au cours de la séance de cet après-midi. 
 
Outre ces modifications réglementaires, l’innovation technologique renforce la nécessité d’une 
coopération et d’un dialogue fructueux entre l’ensemble des parties concernées. Au niveau de la 
France, par exemple, c’est l’objet du « Forum FinTech » qui a été lancé en juillet dernier par 
l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, l’ACPR, en coordination avec l’Autorité des 
marchés financiers française. Le dialogue permanent entre régulateurs, superviseurs et 
entreprises garantira la bonne compréhension des innovations, l’identification rapide des 
nécessaires modifications de la réglementation et la bonne circulation des informations entre les 
différentes parties prenantes. La Banque de France et l’ACPR ont pris l’engagement d’une 
approche graduée et proportionnée à la réglementation et à la supervision des FinTech. Nous 
pensons qu’une telle approche est plus appropriée qu’une solution « bac à sable » (sandbox), qui 
pourrait créer des effets de seuil. Au niveau européen, la coopération entre l’ensemble des parties 
prenantes a été renforcée dans le domaine des paiements, de manière à éviter la fragmentation 
de ce marché : c’est le rôle central confié  au Conseil des paiements de détail en euros (Euro 
 
 
5 
 
Retail Payments Board). Plus tard dans la matinée, Yves Mersch nous présentera des 
informations plus détaillées concernant les travaux de ce Conseil.  
 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure brièvement en exprimant de nouveau ma gratitude envers 
l’ensemble des intervenants, panélistes et participants venus aujourd’hui partager leurs réflexions 
sur une grande variété de sujets d’actualité. Je vous souhaite des débats extrêmement fructueux 
tout au long de cette journée. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Vœux à la Place financière – Paris, 12 janvier 2017  
François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Je vous souhaite à toutes et à tous, qui êtes nos partenaires toute l’année – 
responsables publics, acteurs financiers et économiques, journalistes – la bienvenue 
dans cette magnifique Galerie dorée, pour cette heureuse tradition des vœux à la 
Place. Je veux commencer en vous présentant, au nom de toute la Banque de 
France et de l’ACPR, nos vœux les plus chaleureux pour l’année 2017, pour vous-
mêmes et vos proches, ainsi que pour l’ensemble de vos collaborateurs. A ces vœux 
personnels, je voudrais ajouter ce soir plusieurs vœux collectifs : d’abord pour 
l’Europe et son économie, ensuite pour notre pays, et enfin pour le bon financement 
de notre économie et pour les établissements financiers.   
1) Pour l’Europe et son économie 
Il y a un an, j’avais constaté avec vous que 2016 s’ouvrait comme l’année de la 
volatilité, avec les fortes turbulences sur les marchés financiers. En fait, 2016 a plutôt 
été l’année des incertitudes, avec la victoire du Brexit en juin, l’élection américaine 
en novembre et le référendum italien en décembre. Pourtant, malgré ces 
incertitudes, 2016 a été l’année d’une certaine stabilité en Europe : la croissance de 
la zone euro, d’abord fragile en début d’année, s’est affermie, et les marchés 
financiers ont résisté aux différents chocs.  
Pour 2017, naturellement, aucune de ces incertitudes n’est levée et d’autres vont s’y 
ajouter : 2017 est une année électorale pour les Pays-Bas, la France, l’Allemagne et 
peut-être l’Italie. Néanmoins, la zone euro peut compter sur quatre repères : 
<U+F0B7> la croissance économique, qui s’annonce solide ; dans l’Eurosystème, nous la 
prévoyons à 1,7 % comme en 2016. 
Page 2 sur 6 
<U+F0B7> la remontée progressive de l’inflation. Ce ne devrait pas être une surprise, 
l’Eurosystème annonce avec constance depuis des mois le passage du seuil des 
1 % : à fin décembre, l’inflation a progressé de 1,1 % en zone euro. Cela 
s’explique en partie par le rebond des prix de l’énergie, mais c’est aussi le fruit de 
notre politique monétaire non conventionnelle ; elle a permis d’écarter le danger 
mortel de la déflation qui nous guettait. A l’inverse maintenant, certains semblent 
s’inquiéter d’un « retour de l’inflation » ; c’est très exagéré... et nous ne sommes 
pas encore à notre cible de 2 %. L’autre interrogation affichée porte sur les 
différences entre les pays, avec le + 1,7 % allemand. Ces différences devraient 
s’atténuer progressivement au fil de l’année, et elles sont cohérentes avec les 
sous-jacents économiques.  
<U+F0B7> la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème. Je ne m’y attarderai pas ce soir car 
nous sommes en « période de réserve » avant le prochain Conseil des 
gouverneurs. Mais, dans un monde d’incertitudes, la politique monétaire 
européenne est un repère de prévisibilité très appréciable : notre décision du 8 
décembre dernier a clarifié les perspectives de financement pour les acteurs 
économiques sur les douze mois qui viennent.  
<U+F0B7> l’euro. Notre monnaie commune est solide et reconnue dans le monde entier. Les 
citoyens de la zone euro y sont très majoritairement attachés, à 70 % selon le 
dernier Eurobaromètre de la Commission européenne de décembre, chiffre le plus 
haut atteint depuis 2008.  
Ceci m’amène à formuler deux souhaits pour 2017 :  
<U+F0B7> D’abord, au risque d’un paradoxe audacieux, que la zone euro dans cette année 
électorale puisse être une aire de stabilité relative, face aux incertitudes 
américaines et britanniques. Nous ne savons pas encore comment le Brexit va se 
dénouer mais j’observe qu’il a eu pour effet de faire passer la croissance 
prévisionnelle officielle britannique en dessous de celle de la zone euro, à 1,4 % 
seulement pour 2017. Nous n’avons pas souhaité le Brexit, mais dans les 
négociations, nous avancerons avec un principe clair – le marché unique ne se 
divise pas – et avec une carte décisive à jouer pour la zone euro et la Place 
financière de Paris. Nous devons tous rester pleinement mobilisés pour montrer et 
renforcer l’attractivité de la Place de Paris ; nous avons des marques d’intérêt très 
Page 3 sur 6 
significatives de nombre de maisons internationales, avec qui nous parlons 
discrètement mais sérieusement.   
<U+F0B7> Ensuite, que 2017 ne soit pas une année perdue en Europe pour l’Union 
économique, qui doit venir compléter et équilibrer le succès de l’Union monétaire. 
La priorité à court terme est de construire une « Union de financement et 
d’investissement », pour mieux mobiliser les 350 milliards d’excédent d’épargne 
européenne. Mais il serait aussi souhaitable de préparer dès cette année les 
options permettant une meilleure stratégie économique collective ensuite, et qui 
seront soumises au choix des futurs gouvernements : le livre blanc que la 
Commission européenne doit publier d’ici le printemps est une belle occasion à 
saisir.  
2) Pour notre pays 
2017 est évidemment l’année d’un grand débat démocratique en France. Dans le 
domaine économique, je forme avec vous le vœu que ce débat permette de clarifier 
les diagnostics, présenter les solutions possibles, éclairer les choix d’action. La 
Banque de France est indépendante : cette valeur essentielle vaut pour tous les 
temps, mais plus encore cette année. Notre rôle n’est donc certainement pas de 
distribuer les bons et mauvais points politiques et nous aurons, comme toute grande 
institution publique, un devoir de réserve. En tant qu’institution de confiance, nous 
pouvons juste contribuer à un débat sérieux, grâce aux données et aux études que 
nous publions, et en rappelant les faits. Au regard des succès de beaucoup de nos 
voisins, compatibles avec le respect du modèle social européen, j’ai déjà eu 
l’occasion de le dire : la crédibilité budgétaire et les réformes économiques sont le 
meilleur chemin pour que la croissance et l’emploi accélèrent en France, et pour que 
la France soit écoutée en Europe. La France a fait plus de réformes qu’on ne le dit 
mais moins que nombre de nos voisins, de tous bords politiques.  
La Banque de France sert aussi le pays par les services économiques qu’elle rend. 
En 2016, nous avons aidé 212 000 familles à sortir du surendettement et, 
conformément à ce que nous avions proposé, le législateur a simplifié la procédure 
avec la réforme de la phase amiable

 et la « dé-judiciarisation »

. Ces deux

 La phase amiable sera réservée aux dossiers où le débiteur est propriétaire d’un bien immobilier.  
Page 4 sur 6 
avancées, qui prendront effet au 1
er
 janvier prochain, vont accélérer la mise en 
œuvre de solutions – avec un gain de 3 mois en moyenne : plus de 130 000 familles 
en auraient bénéficié en 2016. Nous avons aussi en 2016 nommé, dans chaque 
département, un correspondant TPE chargé de les conseiller dans leurs demandes 
de financement ou de diagnostics financiers ; j’invite les banques ici présentes à 
poursuivre parallèlement leurs efforts envers les TPE. Enfin, en 2016, la Banque de 
France a été désignée opérateur de la stratégie nationale d’éducation économique et 
financière des publics. À ce titre, nous serons le chef d’orchestre des actions des 
services publics, associations et professionnels, pour fournir à nos concitoyens un 
maximum de ressources pour bien comprendre les questions budgétaires, 
économiques et financières du quotidien. D’ici fin janvier, nous vous donnons 
rendez-vous pour une étape très concrète avec l’ouverture du nouveau portail 
d’information « mes questions d’argent .fr ». 
3) Pour le bon financement de notre économie, et pour les établissements 
financiers 
2016 a globalement été une bonne année pour le financement de notre économie, 
grâce aussi aux professionnels que vous êtes :  
<U+F0B7> le dynamisme du crédit à l’économie en France est le plus fort de tous les 
grands pays de la zone euro. Pour les entreprises, les derniers chiffres à fin 
novembre sont de + 4,9 %, à comparer aux + 2,2 % en zone euro. Pour les 
ménages aussi, les crédits ont augmenté en 2016, de + 4,2 %, contre + 1,9 % en 
zone euro. Et ce dynamisme du crédit a été accompagné par des taux d’intérêt 
parmi les plus faibles d’Europe.  
<U+F0B7> la solidité des banques et des assurances françaises s’est confirmée. Du côté 
des assurances, la solvabilité du marché français est largement satisfaite, avec 
une couverture du capital de solvabilité requis (SCR) de 209 % pour les groupes 
et de 222 % pour les organismes solos au 1
er
 janvier 2016, par rapport au 
minimum réglementaire de 100 %. Pour ce qui est des banques, les grands 
groupes affichent des ratios prudentiels bien au-dessus des exigences minimales, 
avec en particulier un ratio de solvabilité CET1 (« full CRD4 ») moyen de 12,7 % à

 Les commissions de surendettement pourront imposer directement des plans d’effacement de créances sans 
homologation préalable par le juge d’instance. 
Page 5 sur 6 
fin juin 2016, soit plus qu’un doublement par rapport à 2008 (5,8 %). Ailleurs en 
Europe, en Italie notamment, des difficultés subsistent avec certaines banques : 
ces problèmes sont gérables mais il y a urgence à agir. Ce sentiment d’urgence 
semble heureusement enfin s’imposer.  
Pour le bon financement de notre économie, 2017 passe par cinq questions 
prioritaires : 
<U+F0B7> Bâle 3. Nous avons, grâce à notre mobilisation sans faille et à celle de nos 
partenaires européens, déjà évité un mauvais accord tel qu’il se profilait l’été 
dernier. Pour transformer l’essai, il faudrait maintenant, dans les semaines ou 
mois qui viennent, pouvoir conclure un bon accord. La coopération internationale 
en matière de réglementation financière doit rester un actif collectif, des deux 
côtés de l’Atlantique. 
<U+F0B7> Achever l’union bancaire, à partir du paquet de réformes présenté par la 
Commission européenne en novembre dernier – en particulier sur le volet 
résolution. Ces propositions nous paraissent globalement les bonnes. L’union 
bancaire doit maintenant permettre davantage de consolidations transfrontières au 
sein de la zone euro : des banques plus largement européennes pourront mieux 
accompagner l’épargne au-delà des frontières nationales vers les besoins 
d’investissement. 
<U+F0B7> Mieux orienter l’épargne en France vers les entreprises et l’innovation. Nous 
avons réformé depuis un an l'épargne réglementée pour éviter des avantages 
excessifs et l'adapter aux taux bas : baisse du taux du PEL, fin de la surindexation 
du Livret A, incitation à modérer les rendements de l'assurance-vie. En 
complément, il est souhaitable aujourd’hui que les professionnels que vous êtes, 
avec les pouvoirs publics, imaginent de nouveaux produits de long terme : au prix 
d’une moindre liquidité, ils concilieraient protection du capital et rendement plus 
élevé des actions. Leur succès suppose aussi une forme de neutralité fiscale.  
<U+F0B7> Réussir la mue digitale. La révolution numérique crée pour les acteurs 
financiers, comme pour les consommateurs, beaucoup d’opportunités à saisir : 
services financiers plus nombreux et plus accessibles, satisfaction des clients plus 
complète. Mais elle nécessite aussi une réflexion d’ensemble pour adapter les 
business models : diversifier les services et faire évoluer leur tarification, du côté 
des revenus ; anticiper les mutations de l’emploi et des compétences, dans le 
Page 6 sur 6 
dialogue social. La Banque de France et l’ACPR sont mobilisées pour 
accompagner l’innovation : création du « FinTech Forum » et d’un pôle FinTech 
dédié avec l’AMF ; nomination interne d’un « Chief Digital Officer ». La Banque de 
France aussi se transforme. 
<U+F0B7> Ne relâcher en rien les efforts en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment et le 
financement du terrorisme. Il y aura de nouvelles avancées en 2017 avec 
l’entrée en vigueur complète de la loi Urvoas de juin dernier (dont son volet sur la 
lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme) et de l’ordonnance de 
transposition de la 4
ème
 directive européenne. Je vous demande de veiller très 
attentivement à leur application effective. 
Avec toutes ces perspectives, ces défis et ces promesses en tête, je renouvelle à 
chacune et à chacun d’entre vous mes vœux de réussite pour 2017. Je vous 
remercie de votre attention.

Conférence sur la stagnation séculaire et la mesure de la croissance  
Paris, le 16 janvier 2017 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs [diapo 1], 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir tous à Paris pour cette conférence 
sur « la stagnation séculaire et la mesure de la croissance ». On devrait 
toujours être prudent lorsqu’on utilise des expressions aussi catégoriques et 
renvoyant à un horizon de long terme que celle de « stagnation séculaire » : 
l’économiste Alvin Hansen, qui a introduit cette expression pour la première 
fois en 1938, dans son célèbre ouvrage « Full recovery or stagnation », a vécu 
suffisamment longtemps – jusqu’en 1975 – pour connaître trente années de 
quasi pleine reprise économique, et non de stagnation. Néanmoins, ce risque, 
popularisé à nouveau récemment par Larry Summers, est un sujet de 
préoccupation pour les banquiers centraux. Pour quelles raisons ? Parce 
qu’un ralentissement durable de la croissance potentielle de la production 
pourrait rendre l’économie plus vulnérable à des chocs entraînant une baisse 
du taux d’intérêt naturel au-dessous de son plancher effectif. Qu’il soit 
séculaire ou dure de nombreuses années, un très bas niveau de croissance et 
d’inflation remet également en question l’efficacité des outils conventionnels 
de politique monétaire. Il peut nuire à la soutenabilité de la dette publique 
comme de la dette privée. Et, au-delà des préoccupations des banquiers 
centraux, il peut également porter atteinte au bon fonctionnement de nos 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
 
 
modèles sociaux. Je voudrais préciser que je ne parlerai pas de politique 
monétaire aujourd’hui car je dois respecter la période de réserve qui précède 
la réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs. Permettez-moi simplement de dire que 
certains des commentaires récents au sujet d’un « retour de l’inflation », qui 
serait de nature à mettre sous pression le Conseil des gouverneurs, semblent 
très exagérés. 
Où en sommes-nous ? Le ralentissement de la croissance par habitant 
dans les économies avancées remonte en réalité aux années soixante-dix 
[diapo 2]. La dégradation est intervenue en plusieurs étapes, la dernière ayant 
débuté au milieu des années deux mille après la révolution des TIC et avant la 
Grande Récession. Le problème est que ce ralentissement prolongé suscite 
des interrogations au sujet de la croissance potentielle future, en raison 
principalement de l’incertitude concernant la tendance de la productivité. Pour 
évaluer les risques, je souhaiterais évoquer plus en détail les trois hypothèses 
qui seront l’objet de notre conférence d’aujourd’hui [diapo 3] : premièrement, la 
croissance est-elle simplement sous-estimée ? Deuxièmement, le 
ralentissement observé est-il lié à la demande ? Troisièmement, s’agit-il d’un 
phénomène persistant dû à un ralentissement du rythme de l’innovation ?  
*** 
1. La croissance est-elle sous-estimée ?  
Les nouvelles technologies conduisent généralement à des erreurs de 
mesure de la production. Les comptes nationaux peinent en effet à prendre en 
compte les améliorations apportées à la qualité des produits, ainsi que l’entrée 
ou la sortie de produits. Par conséquent, ils ont tendance à surestimer 
l’inflation et à sous-estimer la production. Prenons, par exemple, le cas des 
équipements informatiques : la production de ces biens n’est aujourd’hui pas 
correctement prise en compte, même aux États-Unis.  
Mais la part croissante des technologies numériques dans l’activité 
économique crée de nouveaux défis spécifiques, sur le plan tant conceptuel 
que pratique. Prenons l’exemple des services de voyage. D’un point de vue 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
 
 
conceptuel, la digitalisation gomme la frontière entre le marché et l’économie 
informelle, et favorise le développement de services de consommateur à 
consommateur (« C to C ») ; nous sommes nombreux, en effet, à réserver nos 
vacances directement en ligne. Cette désintermédiation des services s’est 
accompagnée d’une nette amélioration en termes de volume et de qualité. 
Cependant, les services de voyage sont désormais en grande partie des 
« produits maison », et la valeur ajoutée mesurée des services d’agences de 
voyage diminue. Sur le plan pratique, avec l’essor de la digitalisation, de 
nouveaux types de services peuvent être importés, notamment par le biais du 
e-commerce, et la localisation des activités est moins facile à déterminer. En 
outre, du fait que ces services ne sont pas standardisés et évoluent 
rapidement, il est plus difficile d’estimer le déflateur de la production de 
services en comptabilité nationale.  
Les difficultés et erreurs de mesure de la production constituent donc une 
véritable source de préoccupation. Cependant, elles ne peuvent à elles seules 
expliquer l’intégralité du ralentissement, car elles ne sont pas apparues 
soudainement au milieu des années deux mille. 
 
2. S’agit-il également d’un phénomène lié à la demande ? J’ai 
fortement tendance à penser que c’est le cas.  
Les chocs de demande négatifs sont particulièrement néfastes lorsque les 
taux d’intérêt sont déjà faibles, car la marge de manœuvre disponible pour 
stimuler la demande en abaissant les taux d’intérêt est limitée. Dans notre 
jargon de banquiers centraux, nous disons que les taux d’intérêt à court terme 
ne peuvent être ramenés au « taux naturel », qui correspond au niveau auquel 
la demande est égale à la production potentielle, et l’inflation stabilisée. Face à 
ces contraintes, les grandes banques centrales ont mis en œuvre toute une 
série de mesures non conventionnelles, notamment les indications sur la 
trajectoire future des taux (forward guidance) et l’assouplissement quantitatif, 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
 
 
afin de stimuler la demande en abaissant davantage encore les taux d’intérêt 
à long terme.  
Pourquoi la demande met-elle autant de temps à se redresser en dépit de 
ces mesures de forte stimulation ? [diapo 5] Il se peut que les mécanismes 
de fixation des salaires jouent un rôle. Ce point n’a pas fait l’objet d’une 
attention suffisante, en raison de différences entre les pays et parce qu’il s’agit 
d’une question d’ordre microéconomique. La faible réaction des salaires aux 
mesures de stimulation et à un marché du travail tendu est particulièrement 
déroutante en Allemagne. À l’inverse, les salaires réels en France ont été 
relativement dynamiques en dépit de la détérioration du marché du travail, ce 
qui a abouti à de nouvelles pertes de compétitivité. Cela reflète en partie 
l’existence d’un salaire minimum et les règles de réévaluation automatique qui 
y sont associées. Et pourtant, le processus de fixation des salaires est une 
question importante non seulement pour l’emploi, pour la compétitivité et pour 
la croissance, mais également pour la politique monétaire. Les salaires sont 
un déterminant de l’inflation par les coûts tandis que l’objectif d’inflation est 
susceptible d’être pris en compte dans la négociation salariale – à moyen 
terme, les salaires devraient en théorie progresser à un rythme égal au taux 
de croissance de la productivité augmenté de l’objectif d’inflation. De plus, les 
politiques de fixation des salaires pourraient améliorer la coordination dans la 
zone euro, les salaires relatifs pouvant contribuer à la correction des 
déséquilibres. Bien que cette question fasse l’objet d’une moindre attention 
que la politique budgétaire dans le débat public, il pourrait être intéressant de 
l’approfondir davantage dans chaque pays, y compris en France, et dans 
l’ensemble de la zone euro. À cet égard, l’appel à une augmentation 
significative des salaires, formulé par Jens Weidmann en Allemagne en 2014, 
est une initiative courageuse et bienvenue. 
 
Le désendettement constitue un autre facteur susceptible d’agir comme 
un frein à la demande. Les récentes crises financières ont provoqué un 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
 
 
important processus de désendettement, qui a concerné les ménages, les 
entreprises et également les États. La dette des ménages a diminué le plus 
fortement dans les pays où elle avait le plus augmenté, comme aux États-Unis 
et en Espagne. Les entreprises ont réduit leur endettement net afin d’isoler 
leurs bilans de la crise. Et, pour s’assurer que leur dette demeure soutenable, 
les États ont dû réduire leurs déficits par rapport aux niveaux très élevés 
atteints lors de la Grande Récession de 2009. Malheureusement, les 
politiques d’assainissement budgétaire n’ont pas été suffisamment 
coordonnées au sein de la zone euro. Bien que le désendettement puisse être 
souhaitable au niveau individuel pour les groupes surendettés, si tous les 
agents économiques réduisent leur dette simultanément, le ralentissement de 
la demande agrégée apparaît alors inévitable. 
S’agissant de facteurs plus structurels, les tendances démographiques et 
la productivité peuvent également peser sur la demande par leur impact sur 
l’épargne. Quels sont les déterminants de l’épargne à long terme ? Selon la 
théorie économique, les ménages épargnent davantage en phase de 
ralentissement de la croissance économique, soit parce que la population 
occupant un emploi diminue soit parce que la productivité par tête ralentit. 
Plusieurs facteurs sont susceptibles de réduire le taux de croissance de la 
population en âge de travailler et d’accroître l’âge moyen des travailleurs : la 
sortie progressive des « baby-boomers » de la population active, la politique 
de l’enfant unique en Chine et la baisse des taux de fertilité au sein de 
l’OCDE. Ceci peut également peser sur la productivité, les travailleurs plus 
âgés ayant davantage de difficultés à s’adapter aux nouvelles technologies. 
Un autre facteur démographique important est l’accroissement de la longévité 
qui, pour un âge donné de départ en retraite, augmenterait l’épargne. 
Enfin, les inégalités, à la fois au niveau mondial et dans chaque pays, 
peuvent également affecter négativement la demande [diapo 6]. 
L’accroissement des inégalités de revenus au sein des pays (même si elles 
restent sensiblement plus faibles en Europe continentale) implique une baisse 
du pouvoir d’achat des ménages à faibles revenus, qui ont une propension 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
 
 
plus forte à consommer. Des sociétés plus inclusives, avec moins de 
chômeurs et une distribution plus uniforme des revenus, se caractériseraient 
vraisemblablement par une demande plus dynamique.  
3. Assistons-nous à un ralentissement permanent du rythme du progrès 
technologique ?  
Le débat entre les techno-pessimistes et les techno-optimistes quant au 
rythme futur de l’innovation est bien connu. Il résulte du ralentissement de la 
productivité et de la contribution des TIC à la croissance au milieu des 
années deux mille, avant même la Grande Récession. C’est ainsi que les 
États-Unis ont connu une rupture de la tendance haussière de la productivité 
dès 2006.  
En pratique, la diffusion de la technologie peut souffrir de deux types de 
décalages : un décalage temporel, mais également un décalage spatial. Les 
décalages temporels se rapportent au délai nécessaire pour intégrer 
efficacement les innovations dans le processus de production, l’adaptation 
structurelle de l’économie et les processus d’apprentissage nécessaires 
pouvant prendre des décennies. Quel stade de diffusion avons-nous atteint 
pour les TIC ? Les structures des différentes entreprises ont-elles 
suffisamment évolué pour leur permettre de tirer pleinement profit des TIC ? 
J’en doute beaucoup étant donné les décalages temporels généralement 
observés dans la diffusion des technologies passées et les différences de 
niveaux de productivité selon les entreprises. Le second type de décalage, le 
décalage spatial, a trait à la diffusion inégale de la technologie entre les 
entreprises. Les entreprises les plus innovantes enregistrent généralement 
des taux de croissance de la productivité plus forts que les entreprises du 
même secteur qui les imitent. En France, la croissance de la productivité des 
entreprises innovantes est restée stable (ou a même progressé) pendant la 
période de ralentissement de l’activité [diapo 7]. Ce résultat peut refléter un 
phénomène de « gagnant qui remporte toute la mise ». Par exemple, dans 
l’économie numérique, en raison d’externalités de réseau, une entreprise 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
 
 
bénéficiant d’un avantage comparatif marginal peut s’emparer de l’ensemble 
du marché et tirer profit du faible coût marginal de production d’unités 
supplémentaires de son produit. Cependant, il est possible que ces 
phénomènes soient spécifiques aux secteurs produisant des TIC. La 
croissance de la productivité dans les entreprises innovantes reflète 
essentiellement le rythme effectif des avancées technologiques et soutient 
donc la thèse techno-optimiste.   
*** 
J’ai partagé avec vous quelques réflexions relatives à ces trois hypothèses 
prometteuses. En conclusion, j’aimerais vous faire part de ce que je considère 
comme des priorités afin de sortir du piège de la croissance molle et d’éviter le 
risque de la stagnation séculaire.  Il est évident que nous devons accélérer les 
réformes au plan domestique afin de favoriser l’innovation et l’esprit 
d’entreprise. Mais au niveau européen, nous devons remédier à la « pénurie 
d’investissement » persistante qui a suivi la crise financière. Par conséquent, 
nous avons d’abord besoin d’une « Union de financement et 
d’investissement » en Europe afin d’orienter l’épargne abondante vers 
l’investissement et de fournir des sources de financement adaptées à 
l’innovation. Nous avons également besoin, dans une deuxième phase, d’une 
stratégie économique collective au sein de la zone euro, qui pourrait être 
soutenue par un « ministre des Finances » de la zone : la croissance et 
l’emploi seront plus forts en Europe si nous combinons davantage de réformes 
structurelles là où elles sont nécessaires, comme en France et en Italie, et 
davantage de soutien budgétaire et/ou salarial dans les pays disposant d’une 
marge de manœuvre en la matière, comme l’Allemagne. Je conclurai en vous 
souhaitant des discussions très fructueuses tout au long de cette conférence 
et je cède maintenant la place à la première session consacrée aux questions 
de mesure de la croissance. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence de la Banque de France et de la Fondation pour les Études  
et Recherches sur le Développement International (FERDI)   
 
« Quelles réponses aux chocs des termes de l’échange dans les pays 
pauvres et vulnérables ? » 
Paris - 24 janvier 2017  
 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Bonjour et bienvenue à toutes et à tous dans l’auditorium de la Banque de France.  
C’est un grand plaisir de vous y accueillir avec Patrick Guillaumont, Président de la FERDI,  
qui co-organise avec nous cette conférence et que je salue chaleureusement. Je salue 
également Jan Gunning, Professeur émérite à l’Université libre d’Amsterdam, ainsi que 
l’ensemble des intervenants, qui nous font l’honneur de leur présence. 
La Banque de France a noué des partenariats de recherche avec plusieurs fondations  
et universités : l’École d’Économie de Paris, l’École d’Économie de Toulouse ou encore  
la Fondation nationale des Sciences politiques. Le partenariat avec la FERDI (Fondation pour 
les Études et Recherches sur le Développement International), dont nous nous félicitons, vise 
plus particulièrement à prolonger et enrichir la réflexion et la recherche sur les questions 
monétaires et  financières liées au développement, notamment : 
- le financement du développement, en particulier la mobilisation de l’épargne intérieure  
et internationale, 
- la compétitivité des pays africains et les régimes et stratégies de changes, 
- l’intégration régionale en Afrique, qui était l’objet de notre première conférence en 2014, 
- la « malédiction » des matières premières dans les pays à faible revenu, et la gestion du 
syndrome hollandais et des cycles des termes de l’échange, c’est-à-dire des modifications 
Page 2 sur 5

des prix relatifs des exportations par rapport aux importations : c’est le thème de notre 
conférence d’aujourd’hui.  
Le sujet choisi est d’une grande actualité, après la très forte baisse des prix des matières 
premières, en particulier du pétrole entre mi-2014 et début 2016, dont les effets sur les pays 
exportateurs avaient été sous-estimés, à la fois par les pays concernés eux-mêmes, mais aussi 
par la communauté financière internationale. Ainsi, les prévisions de croissance économique de 
l’Afrique sub-saharienne des principales organisations internationales n’ont été que très 
tardivement révisées à la baisse. Alors que le FMI tablait encore, en janvier 2016, sur une 
croissance de 4 % pour 2016 et de 4,7 % pour 2017, les prévisions retenues dans les 
perspectives économiques mondiales d’octobre 2016 s’établissaient à seulement 1,4 % pour 
2016 et 2,9 % pour 2017, presque uniquement en raison de la récession des économies 
pétrolières. L’économie ivoirienne est une autre illustration de l’importance des termes de 
l’échange pour les économies polarisées sur les matières premières. Après avoir connu une 
croissance exceptionnelle au cours des trois dernières années, en partie portée par la bonne 
tenue des cours du cacao, à rebours de celui des autres matières premières, l’activité paraît 
s’essouffler, dans le sillage du retournement des cours. 
Le sujet est également d’une importance majeure pour les banques centrales car l’enjeu est ici 
de trouver les moyens de politiques contracycliques  appropriées face à des chocs de grande 
ampleur que d’évidence la politique monétaire ne peut traiter ni seule, ni sur le long terme. 
Dans cet esprit, je veux partager avec vous ce matin quelques réflexions autour de deux 
questions : quelle est l’importance des cycles des termes de l’échange pour la situation 
économique et financière des pays pauvres exportateurs et de leurs voisins ? Et comment 
atténuer les chocs ?  
** 
1. Quelle est l’importance des chocs des termes de l’échange pour les pays pauvres et 
vulnérables ?  
Pour illustrer mon propos, je prendrai l’exemple de l’Afrique sub-saharienne. Le super-cycle de 
croissance des prix des matières premières a coïncidé avec plus d’une décennie de forte 
croissance économique en Afrique sub-saharienne. Le degré de causalité entre ces deux 
évolutions fait débat. Avant le retournement de ce cycle, une grande majorité d’observateurs 
soulignait le caractère endogène de la croissance africaine et minimisait, voire niait, le rôle de 
l’appréciation des termes de l’échange.   
Cependant, le choc actuel des termes de l’échange aboutit à un renversement de la perception 
des perspectives africaines. Pour les pays exportateurs de pétrole, la division par deux des prix 
Page 3 sur 5 
3 
 
entre mi-2014 et début 2016 s’est ainsi traduite par d’amples déficits budgétaires et extérieurs, 
appelant un ajustement rapide, du fait de la faiblesse ou de l’absence de marges de manœuvre  
contracycliques. L’épargne accumulée en phase haute du prix du pétrole s’est en effet avérée 
largement insuffisante et les capacités d’emprunt des pays concernés restent très limitées, bien 
que certains aient bénéficié des annulations de dette dans le cadre de l’initiative pour les pays 
pauvres très endettés. 
Dans les pays pauvres et vulnérables où le développement financier est faible et l’endettement 
souverain auprès du secteur bancaire dominant, les effets de rétroaction entre détérioration des 
comptes publics et montée de l’endettement, d’une part et liquidité, voire solvabilité du système 
bancaire d’autre part, favorisent également la propagation et l’amplification des chocs.  
Le choc actuel des termes de l’échange rappelle ainsi la trop grande dépendance des pays 
vulnérables et pauvres aux matières premières. 
 
2. Comment atténuer les chocs des termes de l’échange ?  
Sur ce sujet, il me paraît essentiel de distinguer deux types d’objectifs : les objectifs de 
stabilisation économique et financière d’une part, et les objectifs de prévention et de meilleure 
résilience face aux chocs des termes de l’échange d’autre part. 
Concernant la stabilisation économique et financière d’abord, les politiques macroéconomiques 
jouent dans ce domaine un rôle central, en particulier les politiques budgétaires. Bien sûr, pour 
que celles-ci puissent être mises en œuvre, il est nécessaire que des marges de manœuvre 
contracycliques suffisantes subsistent. Mais il convient aussi de réfléchir à la manière dont les 
politiques de consolidation budgétaire peuvent préserver les priorités d’investissement en 
faveur d’un développement durable, reposant sur le développement des infrastructures et du 
capital humain (santé, éducation). Les effets de la consolidation budgétaire peuvent ainsi être 
atténués par une évolution de la composition des recettes et des dépenses, plus favorable à la 
croissance à long terme. 
S’agissant du taux de change, il y a débat sur les politiques optimales à mettre en place dans 
les pays  en développement confrontés à des chocs exogènes.  Si la flexibilité du taux de 
change permet d’accommoder un choc des termes de l’échange, elle est également associée à 
des risques d’amplification, via le déclenchement de spirales inflationnistes ou les pertes de 
change que doivent supporter les agents économiques. Les régimes de change fixe ont 
l’avantage d’ancrer les anticipations des agents économiques et d’offrir ainsi un cadre favorable 
à l’investissement. Ils seront bien entendu d’autant plus crédibles qu’ils bénéficieront d’une 
garantie de convertibilité, comme c’est le cas des unions monétaires de la Zone franc. 
Page 4 sur 5

Par ailleurs, pour les pays pauvres et vulnérables disposant d’accès limités aux financements 
internationaux et parfois dépendants de l’aide publique au développement, la coordination des 
autorités publiques nationales et des partenaires internationaux pour le développement 
constitue un enjeu important.  
La mise en œuvre effective des politiques de stabilisation macroéconomique est en effet 
conditionnée au financement de leurs balances des paiements, souvent catalysé par le FMI. 
J’aimerais à cet égard saluer l’engagement, annoncé simultanément par les pays membres de 
la CEMAC le 23 décembre dernier, à ouvrir et à conclure à brève échéance des négociations 
bilatérales avec le FMI pour mieux structurer leurs efforts d’ajustement.  
En parallèle, il est souhaitable que le FMI adapte ses instruments d’intervention et les 
conditionnalités associées à ses programmes dans les pays pauvres et vulnérables de façon à 
répondre pleinement à l’ampleur des chocs de prix des matières premières. En premier lieu, le 
FMI doit apporter directement ou indirectement un volume de financement proportionné au 
choc. En second lieu, le FMI doit avoir pour objectif de trouver les modalités d’un ajustement 
budgétaire le moins coûteux en termes de croissance, tout en renforçant ses recommandations  
sur la prévention de ce type de choc.  
 
Ceci m’amène à mettre l’accent sur le second type d’objectifs : les objectifs de prévention et de 
meilleure résilience face aux chocs des termes de l’échange.  
La première priorité pour améliorer la prévention et la résilience est de constituer des marges 
de manœuvre budgétaires contracycliques suffisantes, en limitant l’endettement public, voire en 
accumulant des réserves budgétaires. La maîtrise de la masse salariale publique, qui constitue 
le poste de dépenses le plus dynamique en période de croissance dans de nombreux pays 
pauvres et vulnérables, ainsi qu’une meilleure efficacité de la dépense publique, apparaissent à 
cet égard essentielles.  
Il convient également d’envisager la mise en place de règles budgétaires sur la base des 
déficits hors recettes liées aux matières premières, l’adoption de plafonds d’endettement plus 
stricts pour le secteur public et la constitution d’un volant d’épargne suffisant à des fins 
contracycliques, en tenant compte de l’ampleur et de la longueur des cycles de prix des 
matières premières. Dans les pays exportateurs de matières premières non renouvelables, 
notamment de pétrole, ce volant d’épargne doit être encore plus important car il doit viser à 
couvrir non seulement la baisse de la valeur des recettes, mais encore une partie de la baisse 
de la valeur des réserves. 
 
Page 5 sur 5

La deuxième priorité concerne la diversification de l’économie. Les politiques industrielles 
fondées sur des subventions sectorielles ou des dépenses fiscales ne sont pas viables en cas 
de baisse du prix des matières premières et rendent la politique de diversification pro-cyclique. 
L’action publique doit plutôt se concentrer sur l’amélioration du climat des affaires, seule 
susceptible de favoriser l’entreprenariat dans le secteur formel et d’améliorer à terme 
l’attractivité internationale du pays. La diversification n’est enfin soutenable que si l’on évite le 
syndrome hollandais, caractérisé par une appréciation excessive du taux de change réel 
contraignant l’essor d’autres secteurs d’exportation. L’accumulation d’une épargne externe 
contribue à cet objectif. Enfin, la troisième priorité se rapporte à la robustesse du secteur 
financier. J’insisterai à ce titre sur l’importance de mesurer, via des stress tests, les effets 
potentiels d’une forte baisse du prix des matières premières sur la solvabilité du système 
bancaire. Ces stress tests permettent de déterminer le niveau adéquat des fonds propres des 
banques pour résister aux chocs. 
** 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure brièvement en exprimant de nouveau ma gratitude envers 
l’ensemble des intervenants et participants venus aujourd’hui partager leurs réflexions sur ces 
sujets cruciaux. Je vous souhaite de fructueux échanges et laisse à présent la parole à Patrick 
Guillaumont. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Paris FinTech Forum – 25 janvier 2017 
  
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel 
et de résolution  
La France : une place européenne d’excellence pour l’innovation dans les services 
financiers   
 
Bonjour à tous, Je suis ravi d’être avec vous aujourd’hui. Qui aurait imaginé, il y a encore 
quelques années, qu’un banquier central interviendrait dans un forum sur l’innovation ? Je me 
souviens que pour la première réunion, il y a environ un an, avec les codeurs de la start-up « Labo 
blockchain » pour travailler sur un Proof of Concept, les équipes de la Banque de France avaient 
voulu faire un effort : tout le monde s’était habillé casual… sauf que, pour l’occasion, les codeurs 
de la start-up avaient opté pour le costume-cravate. C’était un peu le monde à l’envers !  Mais les 
choses évoluent très vite. Aujourd’hui, le dialogue avec les acteurs innovants va bien au-delà des 
images que chacun pouvait avoir de l’autre : la Banque de France teste la blockchain, elle ouvre 
un LAB pour travailler avec les start-up ; l’ACPR (l’autorité de supervision que je préside) a reçu 
plus de 100 acteurs innovants depuis la création de sa Fintech innovation Unit, et elle a créé avec 
l’AMF un Fintech Forum pour intensifier le dialogue avec les acteurs innovants. Pour tous les 
acteurs financiers, y compris pour la Banque de France et l’ACPR, la révolution digitale crée des 
défis mais aussi de formidables opportunités à saisir, que ce soit au niveau des FinTech elles-
mêmes, de tout le système financier – banques et assurances,  ou de l’économie française et 
européenne dans son ensemble.  
*** 
 
I. Quels enjeux pour les FinTech ?  
Comment pourrait-on se passer aujourd’hui des cagnottes en ligne pour les événements, des 
agrégateurs d’informations sur les comptes bancaires ou encore des services de paiement entre 
- 2 - 
particuliers pour partager des factures de restaurant ou des frais de colocation ? Steve Jobs avait 
utilisé ce mantra bien connu : « simplicity is the ultimate sophistication » et je crois que toutes ces 
innovations ont su répondre simplement, et souvent à moindre coût, aux besoins et aux nouveaux 
usages des clients. Elles ont su associer technologie et design de l’interface client. Elles ont 
souvent été imaginées par des start-ups réactives, en phase avec le marché et qui s’autorisent à 
penser au-delà des cadres existants. Aujourd’hui le marché français est le second marché 
européen du financement participatif après la Grande-Bretagne et un des marchés les plus actifs 
en Europe pour l’innovation en matière de paiement. 
Je veux vous le dire aujourd’hui : nous apprenons de vous. Vous pouvez contribuer vous aussi, 
par vos technologies, à rendre le système financier plus sûr. L’intelligence artificielle et les 
chatbots que vous développez nous aideront à répondre plus efficacement au public, le big data, 
le machine learning, ainsi que la biométrie, à mieux prévenir les fraudes, la blockchain et les smart 
contracts à optimiser les transactions, vos API (Application Programming Interface) et vos 
technologies open source  à accroitre l’interopérabilité des technologies financières. 
 Et si je réfléchis à mon tour à ce que la Banque de France et l’ACPR peuvent vous apporter,  
je dirais : une régulation stable, fiable et agile. Stable car nous sommes profondément ancrés dans 
la réglementation européenne : les FinTech établies en France peuvent donc offrir leurs services 
dans tous les pays de l’Union européenne, c’est ce qu’on appelle le « passeport européen ». 
Fiable, car nous veillons à limiter les risques potentiels, pour que l’innovation soit toujours 
synonyme de protection de la clientèle, sécurité des paiements, sécurité informatique et stabilité 
financière. Mais aussi agile, car l’innovation ne doit pas être étouffée par les 
contraintes administratives, c’est pourquoi nous développons une régulation assise sur des 
principes ou des objectifs plutôt que sur des règles, et intégrant une proportionnalité par les 
risques. Les nouveaux acteurs FinTech contribuent aussi à la concurrence avec les acteurs du 
numérique déjà en place, et en particulier avec les initiatives des géants du web américains. Les 
enjeux industriels sont importants : nous devons favoriser cette concurrence active, largement 
préférable aux monopoles, même technologiques. Une régulation stable, fiable et agile, c’est un 
facteur de confiance. Et la confiance, c’est un facteur de succès pour l’innovation. Nous voulons 
construire cette régulation avec votre active participation. Nous avons besoin de vos contributions 
pour une transposition rapide et efficace de la directive dite DSP2 ; nous avons aussi besoin de 
votre mobilisation pour développer une « Regtech » d’excellence. 
 
 
II. Quels enjeux pour l’industrie financière française ? 
L'innovation ne concerne pas que les nouveaux entrants, bien sûr. Pour les banques comme 
pour les assurances, la révolution digitale bouscule le modèle historique de  la relation clientèle. 
Un chiffre est révélateur : celui de la fréquentation des agences bancaires. En 2007, 62 % des 
 
 
3 
 
Français fréquentaient leur agence plusieurs fois par mois. En 2016, ce chiffre est trois fois moins 
élevé : 20 % – et même seulement 13 % pour les 18-34 ans
1
. Les parcours clients sont de plus en 
plus digitalisés : la France est d’ailleurs le premier grand pays européen pour l’usage d’internet 
pour les services bancaires (69 % des clients)
2
. Mais au-delà de la relation clientèle, réussir la mue 
digitale nécessite pour les établissements financiers de mener une réflexion d’ensemble, sur la 
gestion stratégique, pour donner une place centrale à la culture de l’innovation, et sur les business 
models. Ce sont des choix difficiles, qui appartiennent naturellement aux établissements eux-
mêmes ; les réponses ne sont ni évidentes, ni uniformes, mais je veux partager avec vous 
quelques pistes.  
Du côté des banques, il faut bien sûr repenser les sources de revenu : une des réponses peut 
venir de la diversification des services – propres ou en partenariat – proposés aux clients, comme 
de l’évolution éventuelle de leur tarification, avec moins de prix fixes et davantage de tarification à 
l’usage. La transformation digitale passe aussi par l’anticipation des mutations de l’emploi et des 
compétences, dans le dialogue social. Elle repose aussi sur une démarche d’ouverture, avec des 
partenariats avec des FinTech et le monde scientifique. Enfin, elle appelle des investissements 
informatiques importants, à la fois pour fournir un service toujours plus adapté aux clients, pour 
réduire les coûts structurels et pour renforcer encore la conformité aux exigences réglementaires. 
Les systèmes d’information devront être – et c’est là toute le défi – à la fois plus sûrs, pour offrir 
une protection forte contre les cyber-risques, et plus souples et propices à l’inter-connectivité.  
Du côté des assurances, la révolution digitale commence aussi par la refonte de la relation 
clientèle et des usages, mais elle va au-delà. Je veux souligner deux sujets qui me paraissent 
essentiels. Tout d’abord, avec l’aide des réassureurs, les assureurs doivent être en mesure de 
répondre aux besoins de couverture contre les cyber-risques, une préoccupation qui touche 
l’ensemble des entreprises, des plus petites aux plus grandes. Pourtant, en 2015, moins de 5 % 
des entreprises françaises et 6 % des particuliers avaient souscrit une cyber-assurance
3
. Les 
entreprises d’assurance peuvent et doivent se nourrir de leur propre expérience contre les cybers-
risques pour faire émerger d’une offre française et européenne de cyber-assurance plus mature. 
Deuxième sujet : les données et le Big Data, avec le développement des objets connectés qui 
démultiplient la quantité d’informations sur les assurés. C’est naturellement une opportunité : le 
métier historique des assurances consiste précisément à collecter et exploiter des données pour

mesurer un risque et en déduire une tarification. J’appelle néanmoins les acteurs à une approche 
responsable : il faut trouver un juste équilibre entre la segmentation et le partage du risque entre 
assurés – ce sont les principes de solidarité et de mutualisation consubstantiels à l’assurance qui 
sont en jeu ; et il ne faut pas perdre de vue nos valeurs collectives à l’égard du respect de la vie 
privée.  
 
III. Quels enjeux pour l’économie française et européenne ?  
Il faut rappeler deux évidences économiques : il n'est pas de croissance durable sans hausse 
de la productivité ; et il n'est pas de productivité sans l'innovation et sa bonne diffusion. Les 
économistes s'interrogent beaucoup sur le ralentissement aujourd'hui de la productivité, et la 
crainte pour certains d'une « stagnation séculaire ». Le terme me paraît excessif, et vous en êtes 
la preuve. Mais l'impératif pour une économie compétitive et de croissance, c'est d'augmenter 
l'innovation et sa diffusion, pas de la ralentir. La digitalisation du secteur financier peut accélérer ce 
processus bénéfique : elle contribue à diffuser les avancées technologiques telles que la signature 
électronique, les technologies de défense face aux cyber-attaques ou encore les technologies de 
registre distribué. Les solutions de paiements innovantes et sécurisées, dont demain la blockchain, 
participent aussi au développement accéléré du e-commerce et à la modernisation du commerce 
physique.  
Il faut pour cela approfondir encore l’harmonisation européenne : dans l’application fine des 
textes régissant le secteur financier (définition et sécurité des services de paiement), dans les 
domaines plus récents (financement participatif) ou encore dans la recherche d’une meilleure 
interopérabilité des technologies et des normes. Mais il est surtout indispensable de définir une 
stratégie globale pour l’innovation européenne dans les services financiers. Cette stratégie doit 
faire converger l’ensemble des thématiques suscitées par la finance digitale : de la protection des 
données à la lutte contre le blanchiment ; de la sécurité informatique à la protection du 
consommateur ; de la stabilité financière aux enjeux sociaux de l’inclusion bancaire, de l’éducation 
financière et des mutations du travail dans le secteur financier. C’est un chantier mené 
actuellement par la Commission Européenne. La Banque de France et l’ACPR y prennent part. Il 
en va de l’Europe, de son indépendance vis-à-vis des autres grands ensembles régionaux et du 
dynamisme de son économie.   
*** 
Vous l'avez compris : l'innovation est clé pour les régulateurs que nous sommes. Et la France 
a beaucoup d'atouts en Europe pour être un leader de de cette transformation digitale. Vous en 
êtes les acteurs, avec votre audace et vos succès ; à nous – Banque de France et ACPR – d’en 
être les partenaires compétents, vigilants lorsqu’il le faut, et ouverts toujours. Soyez assurés que 
nous sommes pleinement mobilisés dans cette direction. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Vereinigung der Bayerischen Wirtschaft – Munich, 26 janvier 2017 
Intervention de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
« La politique monétaire de la zone euro et les entreprises » 
 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous et je vous remercie de votre invitation. C’est 
la deuxième fois en quelques mois que j’ai la joie d’être en Bavière. En septembre, j’ai eu 
l’honneur de recevoir ici à Munich, remis par le Ministre a. D. Erwin Huber, le prix 
Montgelas en souvenir d’un de vos grands hommes d’État. Si vous me permettez une note 
personnelle, je viens ici comme Européen convaincu et comme ami de l’Allemagne. Je suis 
Français mais j’ai mes racines en Sarre : ma famille y vit depuis la fin du 18
ème
 siècle et fait 
partie du « Mittelstand » allemand, avec la manufacture de porcelaine Villeroy & Boch. Je 
suis attaché à votre pays et j’admire sa réussite, en particulier celle de ses entrepreneurs. 
La Bavière en est une illustration : c’est aujourd’hui l’un des pôles économiques les plus 
importants d’Europe. J'aurai aussi le plaisir de rencontrer tout à l'heure le Dr Theo Waigel, 
qui a joué avec d’autres responsables publics allemands un rôle si important dans la 
construction de notre solide monnaie commune qu'est l'euro. 
Selon nos prévisions, la croissance en zone euro devrait être de 1,7 % en 2017, 
comme en 2016. La reprise économique se confirme, et c’est une bonne nouvelle, mais la 
situation n’est pas encore satisfaisante. La zone euro doit viser globalement une croissance 
plus forte et plus durable. La politique monétaire joue bien sûr un rôle crucial : elle assure la 
stabilité des prix nécessaire à la croissance ; ce sera mon premier point. Mais toute seule, 
elle ne sera jamais suffisante. Pour accélérer la croissance, il faut agir sur les autres leviers 
de politique économique ; j’y reviendrai. Enfin, je partagerai avec vous quelques réflexions 
sur le nouveau contexte international qui renforce l’urgence d’agir en Europe.  
** 
 
- 2 - 
1. Notre politique monétaire est un atout pour la zone euro.  
 Je suis tout à fait conscient que la politique monétaire de la BCE suscite de vifs débats 
en Allemagne. Permettez-moi de dire d’abord pourquoi nous la menons, et où nous en 
sommes aujourd’hui.  
 
a) Pourquoi menons-nous cette politique monétaire ? Notre Banque centrale 
européenne a été, il faut le rappeler, fortement construite sur le modèle de la Bundesbank 
et de ses succès. Et je crois sincèrement que notre politique monétaire actuelle est 
largement en accord avec les valeurs allemandes que je partage totalement : 
l’indépendance, le respect des Traités, la stabilité des prix, le long terme. Contrairement à 
ce que suggèrent certains critiques, notre politique monétaire n’est pas une fantaisie latine. 
Nous la décidons de façon collective au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs et nous prenons 
très au sérieux le mandat qui nous a été confié : assurer la stabilité des prix. Cela signifie 
une inflation ni trop forte, ni trop faible. Une inflation trop forte aurait des conséquences 
désastreuses sur l’économie – l’histoire de l’Allemagne en témoigne. Une inflation trop 
faible nous aurait exposé au danger mortel de la déflation, les années 1930 l’ont hélas 
montré. En pratique, la stabilité des prix a été définie par le Conseil des Gouverneurs dès 
2003 comme un taux d’inflation à moyen terme proche de, mais inférieur à, 2 %. Cette 
définition n’a pas varié depuis et elle est largement partagée aujourd’hui par toutes les 
grandes banques centrales des pays développés, y compris aux États-Unis et au 
Royaume-Uni. Jusqu’à ces dernières années, la stabilité des prix a été remarquable dans 
la zone euro. Mais à partir de 2013, l’inflation est passée nettement sous la barre des 2 %. 
Notre mandat nous imposait de réagir pour faire remonter l’inflation vers des niveaux plus 
sains pour nos économies. 
 
b) Où en sommes-nous aujourd’hui ? Aujourd’hui, l’inflation remonte 
progressivement dans la zone euro, conformément à ce que nous avions annoncé : nous 
sommes passés d’une baisse de 0,2 % en avril 2016 à une progression de 1,1 % en 
décembre dernier. Cela s’explique en partie par le rebond des prix de l’énergie, mais c’est 
aussi le fruit de notre politique monétaire : elle a permis d’écarter le risque de la déflation 
qui nous menaçait encore en 2015. A l’inverse maintenant, certains semblent s’inquiéter 
d’un « retour de l’inflation » ; c’est très exagéré. Nous ne sommes pas encore à notre cible 
de 2 % et l’inflation « core » – hors énergie et alimentation – n’est que de 0,9 %. L’autre 
interrogation porte sur les écarts entre les pays, avec + 1,7 % en Allemagne. Après un pic 
temporaire au premier trimestre, l’inflation allemande devrait néanmoins rester en dessous 
de 2 % en moyenne sur l’année 2017. De plus, les écarts d’inflation entre pays sont 
cohérents avec les différentes situations économiques nationales : la croissance et l’emploi 
 
 
3 
 
sont également plus forts en Allemagne ; et ces écarts pourraient même contribuer, via leur 
impact sur les salaires relatifs, à la correction des déséquilibres, et donc à une meilleure 
convergence dans la zone euro.  
J’entends bien sûr les inquiétudes des épargnants allemands face aux taux d’intérêt 
bas. Notre objectif n’est pas de maintenir des taux bas trop longtemps : les taux bas ne 
sont pas un but en soi ; ils ne sont aujourd’hui que la condition nécessaire pour revenir 
progressivement vers la cible d’inflation, et donc pour avoir demain des taux durablement 
plus élevés, comme Mario Draghi lui-même l’a dit. Ce mouvement a commencé sur les taux 
à long terme depuis fin septembre dernier : le taux du Bund à 10 ans a remonté de près de 
60 points de base. Compte tenu de nos progrès, nous avons décidé en décembre de 
réduire nos achats mensuels de titres, de 80 à 60 milliards d’euros. Je redis ici aussi ma 
conviction que si les taux d'intérêt négatifs ont une utilité, ils ont des limites évidentes. 
Mais, même si l’assouplissement quantitatif (QE – « quantitative easing ») ne va à 
l’évidence pas durer éternellement, nous n’avons clairement pas parlé de « tapering » ni de 
stratégie de sortie de notre politique monétaire accommodante (« exit strategy »). Nos 
décisions de politique monétaire ont en effet apporté de la prévisibilité pour toute l’année à 
venir et, durant cette période, nous ferons abstraction des évolutions temporaires de 
l’inflation pour nous concentrer sur les perspectives d’inflation à moyen terme pour la zone 
euro dans son ensemble.  Enfin, les taux d’intérêt ne dépendent pas que de la politique 
monétaire. Ils découlent aussi de la croissance économique. L’intérêt des épargnants est 
donc que la croissance gagne de la vigueur en Europe.  
 Mais, comme l’a dit mon collègue Jens Weidmann au printemps dernier, « les gens ne 
sont pas que des épargnants » [« Menschen sind nicht nur Sparer »]. En Allemagne aussi, 
en Bavière, les entreprises, les salariés, les consommateurs, les accédants à la propriété 
bénéficient des taux d'intérêt bas de la BCE. Nos mesures créent des conditions 
particulièrement favorables pour le bon financement des entreprises et des ménages. Le 
crédit a nettement augmenté : en novembre 2016, il avait progressé en Allemagne de 3,5 
% sur 12 mois pour les entreprises. De plus, le crédit coûte moins cher car les taux d’intérêt 
bancaires ont baissé régulièrement. Plusieurs études le confirment : la politique monétaire 
soutient aussi la croissance du PIB – pour plus de 1,5 point de pourcentage sur 2015-2018. 
La stabilité définitive des changes à l’intérieur de la zone euro et, à l’extérieur, le constat 
d’un taux de change effectif plus favorable, sont des atouts incontestables pour les 
exportateurs allemands et bavarois, d’Airbus à Dräxlmaier ou BrauKon. Les études 
économiques convergent : les gains liés à l’euro profitent à tous, mais c’est l’économie 
allemande qui a le plus bénéficié de l’appartenance à l’euro. Et quels que soient les débats 
- 4 - 
sur notre politique monétaire, c’est en Allemagne que le soutien à l’euro est le plus fort, et 
en hausse : 81 % à fin 2016, même si ce niveau est fort aussi dans la moyenne de la zone 
euro (70 %) et dans mon propre pays (68 %). Mais pour avoir plus de croissance, la 
politique monétaire ne suffit pas, nous en serons tous d’accord. 
 
2. Pour plus de croissance, nos pays doivent se réformer, et l’Europe doit agir 
rapidement sur deux leviers complémentaires.   
Le premier levier de croissance pour la zone euro, c’est davantage de réformes 
dans nos pays, et une meilleure stratégie économique collective. La croissance et 
l’emploi seraient plus forts en Europe avec davantage de réformes structurelles là où elles 
sont prioritaires, comme en France, et davantage d’investissement public par exemple et 
de soutien budgétaire, là où des marges de manœuvre existent, comme en Allemagne.  
S’agissant des réformes, je souhaite aussi comme vous que la France accélère ; je 
le dis souvent dans mon pays. Ces réformes sont compatibles avec le modèle social 
européen que nous partageons ; beaucoup de succès en Europe le montrent. Mais ne 
jugez pas votre voisin « irréformable ». Ces dernières années, la France n’est pas restée 
sans rien faire. Les retraites ont été réformées. Des réformes comme le « CICE » – un 
crédit d’impôt –, le Pacte de Responsabilité, la loi travail « El Khomry », ont nettement 
réduit les charges pesant sur les entreprises. Depuis deux ans, les engagements de 
réduction du déficit ont été tenus ; il faut que cette crédibilité budgétaire continue de 
s’améliorer en 2017. Tout ceci ne suffit pas, mais ne doutez pas trop de la France, y 
compris dans cette année électorale. La solidité de nos institutions politiques et de notre 
système majoritaire est un atout durable.   
À partir de sa situation économique nettement plus favorable, l'Allemagne doit, elle 
aussi, poursuivre sur la voie de la réforme : les évolutions démographiques devraient 
entraîner une diminution de la population active - et l'afflux de réfugiés que l'on observe 
actuellement ne changera pas la donne de manière significative. Il en résultera un 
ralentissement de la croissance à long terme. Mais ce n’est naturellement pas à moi de 
recommander des mesures dans votre pays. Au niveau européen, notre compétitivité 
passe notamment par la création d'un grand marché commun dans le domaine du 
numérique.   
Je sais que lorsque les Français parlent de coordination en Europe, les Allemands 
pensent parfois qu'il pourrait s'agir d'une nouvelle astuce pour éviter les réformes. Il faut 
sortir de cette impasse : il nous faut à la fois des réformes nationales et une coordination 
européenne. Comme le disait souvent Helmut Schmidt, nous devons construire une union 
 
 
5 
 
économique en complément de l'union monétaire. Mais ceci ne passe pas à mes yeux par 
une « Union de transferts » que l’Allemagne refuse légitimement.  
 
Deuxième levier de croissance : construire en parallèle ce que j’appelle l’« Union de 
financement et d’investissement » (UFI). Pourquoi ? Car il y a aujourd’hui encore en 
Europe des entreprises qui veulent investir et innover, mais qui ne trouvent pas les 
financements adaptés. Et pourtant, les ressources ne manquent pas : la zone euro a plus 
de 350 milliards d’excédent d’épargne, soit plus de 3 % du PIB. L’UFI doit donc permettre 
de mieux mobiliser cette épargne abondante en faveur de l’investissement. Pour cela, il 
faut mettre en synergie les initiatives existantes : l’Union des marchés de capitaux, le Plan 
d’investissement Juncker et l’Union bancaire. Mais il faut aller plus loin avec deux objectifs 
clairs. Premier objectif : la diversification du financement des entreprises pour répondre à 
leurs besoins. Le financement par fonds propres, plutôt que par endettement, est le plus 
adapté à la prise de risque et donc à l’innovation. Pourtant, l’Europe est très en retard dans 
ce domaine : le financement par fonds propres des entreprises y est deux fois plus faible 
qu’aux États-Unis (67 % du PIB en zone euro contre 125 % aux États-Unis). Deuxième 
objectif : une plus grande résilience de la zone euro grâce à des marchés de capitaux 
intégrés. Comme je l’ai écrit avec Jens Weidmann l’année dernière, cette forme de partage 
des risques privés est le meilleur moyen d’atténuer les chocs asymétriques dans une union 
monétaire. Aux États-Unis par exemple, le capital privé est capable d’amortir environ 40 % 
d’un choc économique spécifique à un État.  
 
3. La nouvelle donne internationale renforce l’urgence d’agir.  
Certains autour de nous semblent ne plus croire aux bénéfices de l’Union 
européenne. Le nouveau président américain l’a dit sans ambiguïté, et les Britanniques ont 
fait le choix de la quitter. Ces changements nous mettent face à nos responsabilités : nous 
ne pouvons pas nous contenter d’être attentistes. Mais comment réagir ? Pas par moins 
d’Europe. Ce serait une erreur si nous voulons maîtriser collectivement notre destin dans 
ce monde nouveau. Mais par une « meilleure » Europe, moins dispersée dans les détails, 
plus concentrée sur ses priorités et plus efficace. Et nous ne devons pas simplement en 
parler, nous devons nous donner les moyens d’obtenir des résultats concrets. Il y a bien sûr 
des domaines non-économiques : pour en citer quelques-uns, la défense et la protection 
des frontières, le changement climatique ou l’éducation et la formation des jeunes. Mais 
dans le domaine économique, il reste beaucoup à faire également. Nous avons trois grands 
- 6 - 
atouts en Europe : notre monnaie unique, notre marché unique et notre modèle social 
commun. Je souligne combien cette « soziale Marktwirtschaft » est une réponse aux 
débats du monde anglo-saxon : l'Allemagne, comme nombre de pays européens, montre 
qu'on peut allier le succès économique et la cohésion sociale, avec moins d'inégalités. Ce 
n'est donc pas le moment de « baisser le drapeau » européen,  mais de construire plus 
activement sur nos atouts, y compris par une meilleure Union économique dont j’ai parlé.  
 
J’ajouterai quelques mots sur le Brexit. Nous ne l’avons pas souhaité, mais c’est à 
l’évidence une mauvaise nouvelle d’abord pour le Royaume-Uni et son 
économie. J’observe que la victoire du Brexit a eu pour effet de faire passer la croissance 
prévisionnelle officielle britannique en dessous de celle de la zone euro, à 1,4 % seulement 
pour 2017. La priorité est d'en gérer les conséquences avec le moins de heurts possible et 
de réduire autant que possible les incertitudes. Le discours de la Première ministre 
britannique la semaine dernière a apporté certaines clarifications,  mais il est important de 
rappeler un principe clair : le marché unique ne se divise pas ; l’accès au marché unique 
est inséparable du respect de ses règles. C’est toute la difficulté d’un simple accord de 
libre-échange comme proposé par Mme May, et il ne peut pas y avoir d’Europe « à la 
carte » (cherry-picking). La Chancelière allemande a légitimement rappelé le caractère 
essentiel de l’unité des 27 là-dessus. 
** 
Je voudrais pour conclure partager avec vous ma conviction. Face aux incertitudes 
américaines et mondiales, je souhaite que la zone euro puisse être une aire de stabilité 
relative et de croissance. Mais plus que jamais, la France et l'Allemagne ont besoin d’agir 
ensemble. Comme banquier central, notre responsabilité est de mener la meilleure 
politique monétaire pour la zone euro, conformément à notre mandat. Mais cette politique 
monétaire ne peut pas, ne doit pas, tout faire. Ma responsabilité c’est aussi de faire des 
propositions pour que les autres politiques économiques soient plus efficaces. J’ai esquissé 
quelques pistes devant vous avec ma conviction d’Européen, et je serai heureux de 
répondre maintenant à vos questions.

e
 édition des Rencontres de l’épargne et de l’investissement  
Paris, 31 janvier 2017 
Intervention de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs les Parlementaires, 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de participer pour la deuxième année consécutive aux 
Rencontres de l’épargne et de l’investissement. Je suis tenté de commencer en 
rappelant une expression que Ben Bernanke, qui allait devenir président de la 
Réserve fédérale américaine, avait popularisée au milieu des années 2000 : le 
« savings glut », qui désignait la surabondance d’épargne au niveau mondial. En 
France comme en Europe, l’épargne est aujourd’hui abondante et excède de loin le 
montant des investissements: la zone euro a plus de 350 milliards d’excédent 
d’épargne, ce qui représente plus de 3 % du PIB. Mais, à mes yeux, la solution n’est 
pas moins d’épargne, mais une épargne mise davantage au service du financement 
des entreprises et de l’innovation ; pour reprendre le thème de ces Rencontres, une 
épargne plus « productive ». C’est une des conditions pour que nous ayons en 
France comme en Europe une croissance économique plus forte et plus durable. Je 
veux aborder trois questions avec vous : quelle est la situation en France ? Quelles 
sont les conséquences pour notre économie ? Quelles sont les priorités d’action ? 
** 
1. En France, l’épargne est une ressource abondante mais prudente 
Contrairement à ce que certains croient, l’épargne n’est pas seulement une vertu 
allemande ; c’est aussi une vertu française et une vertu européenne.  
En France,  le taux d’épargne des ménages représente 14 % de leur revenu 
 
 
2 
 
disponible au troisième trimestre 2016. En zone euro, il est à 13 % en moyenne, soit 
bien plus qu’aux États-Unis, avec 9 %, et a fortiori qu’au Royaume-Uni, où il n’est 
que de 6 %. En pratique, les Français investissent une bonne partie de cette épargne 
dans l’immobilier, mais ils consacrent aussi près de 6 % de leurs revenus à des 
placements financiers nets des remboursements d’emprunts : là aussi, c’est plus 
qu’aux États-Unis (4 %). Et en dix ans, le patrimoine financier des ménages français 
a augmenté de plus de 1000 milliards d’euros. Il représente à fin septembre 2016 
près de 4540 milliards d’euros d’encours, répartis en trois tiers : dépôts bancaires, 
titres et contrats d’assurance-vie (ce dernier tiers, y compris les UC, est le plus 
important).  
Une caractéristique très nette des épargnants français est leur attachement aux 
placements sûrs, c’est-à-dire ceux qui fournissent une protection du capital. Pour 
leurs placements financiers, les épargnants français privilégient les dépôts bancaires 
et l’épargne réglementée et les fonds euros des contrats d’assurance-vie, que l’on 
qualifie généralement d’actifs ""non risqués"", au détriment des titres et des contrats 
d’assurance-vie en unités de compte, dits actifs risqués. Les placements en actifs 
« non risqués » représentent en France près de 125 % du PIB, le double de ce que 
l’on constate aux États-Unis (66 %). Inversement, les placements en actifs dits 
« risqués » sont près de quatre fois plus faibles en France qu’aux États-Unis : 76 % 
contre 248 %.  
Un mot sur les termes mêmes que je viens d’employer : la distinction risqué / non 
risqué est inutilement anxiogène ; il serait tentant de lui substituer celle de productif / 
non productif, pour reprendre le thème d’aujourd’hui. Ce serait cependant un peu 
abusif. Pour refléter la réalité de façon plus neutre, il faut distinguer plutôt épargne en 
fonds propres (qui a vocation à être à long terme) et épargne en taux (qui est 
souvent davantage liquide).  
 
2. Quelles sont les conséquences pour notre économie ? 
Premièrement, cela crée un rendement plus faible de l’épargne des Français, 
dans un contexte de taux bas. Et sur cette question des rendements de l’épargne, un 
sujet revient dans l’actualité : l’inflation, qui remonte progressivement, 
conformément à ce que l’Eurosystème avait annoncé, avec + 0,6 % en novembre et 
 
 
3 
 
+ 1,1 % en décembre dans la zone euro (+ 0,8 % en France). L’inflation qui remonte 
est-elle une menace pour les épargnants ? Je crois que non, pour deux raisons.  
D’une part parce que les taux d’intérêt sur l’ « épargne en taux », pour reprendre 
cette distinction, vont rester positifs : sur le Livret A par construction ; sur le PEL 
aussi - le taux de rémunération des nouveaux PEL est à 1 % et le taux de 
rémunération moyen sur le stock de PEL est plus élevé, encore à 2,7 % en 
novembre 2016, mais également sur l’assurance-vie, malgré la baisse en cours sur 
les rendements des fonds euros : environ 1,9 % en moyenne attendus en 2016 
contre 2,3 % en 2015.  
D’autre part, parce que les craintes de retour de l’inflation parfois exprimées sont 
exagérées : nous - l’Eurosystème - ne sommes pas encore à notre cible d’inflation  
proche de 2 % à moyen terme, et l’inflation « sous-jacente » (hors énergie et 
matières premières) est encore plus faible. Les taux d’intérêt nominaux, que nous 
déterminons en partie, devraient remonter progressivement avec le chemin vers la 
cible d’inflation. Cela étant, les taux d’intérêt réels (après inflation) dépendent moins 
de la politique monétaire. Ils découlent aussi de la croissance économique. L’intérêt 
des épargnants est donc que la croissance gagne de la vigueur en Europe ; pour 
autant, les taux réels pourraient rester faibles un certain temps. En conséquence, la 
diversification des placements, de l’épargne en taux vers l’épargne en fonds propres 
est une réponse rationnelle. Ce d’autant plus qu’à long terme, l’épargne en actions a, 
comme nous le savons, en moyenne un rendement plus élevé. 
La diversification des placements est non seulement dans l’intérêt des épargnants 
mais elle est aussi dans l’intérêt des entreprises et de notre économie. Une 
économie en rattrapage, comme l’Europe de l’après-guerre ou beaucoup de pays 
émergents aujourd’hui, peut se financer par endettement. Mais dans une économie 
proche de la « frontière technologique », comme c’est le cas en France ou aux États-
Unis, les entreprises doivent innover davantage. Il  leur faut donc plus de 
financement par fonds propres : l’innovation étant plus risquée, son financement doit 
rapporter davantage. Les start-ups et les entreprises en croissance le savent bien, 
mais nos ETI et nos PME doivent aussi pouvoir se servir de ce levier financier pour 
se développer. Malheureusement, dans ce domaine, l’Europe est très en retard : les 
fonds propres représentent seulement  70 % du PIB en France. Leur poids est deux 
 
 
4 
 
fois plus important aux États-Unis (125 %). Il est urgent de mieux orienter l’épargne 
en France et en Europe vers les entreprises et l’innovation. 
 
3. Pour que l’épargne soit plus productive, il y a deux priorités  
En préalable, nous avons réformé depuis un an l'épargne réglementée pour éviter 
des avantages excessifs et l’adapter aux taux bas, avec la baisse du taux du PEL, la 
fin de la surindexation du Livret A, les incitations à modérer les rendements de 
l'assurance-vie.  
Première priorité : il est temps maintenant de compléter la réflexion sur les 
nouveaux produits d’épargne. Le débat français gagnerait à mieux distinguer deux 
aspirations des Français dans leur aversion au risque : la sécurité et la liquidité. Sur 
la sécurité, l’attachement des épargnants est fort ; mais sur la liquidité, les 
perspectives des Français sont de plus en plus à long terme, du fait du vieillissement 
de la population et de la préparation de leurs retraites. Il est donc souhaitable que les 
professionnels, avec les pouvoirs publics, imaginent de nouveaux produits de long 
terme, adaptés aux attentes des Français et plus productifs pour notre économie : 
des produits moins liquides, mais assortis d’une forme de protection du capital et 
bénéficiant du rendement plus élevé des actions dans la durée. Leur succès suppose 
aussi d’éviter les distorsions fiscales au détriment de ces produits par rapport à 
l’épargne liquide et sans risque. Essayons de sortir progressivement de la multiplicité 
des niches ; relevons aussi que, au moins autant que le taux global de taxation de 
l’épargne, c’est la structure de cette taxation qui compte. Cette neutralité fiscale 
devrait idéalement se retrouver également du côté des entreprises financées pour ne 
pas pénaliser le financement par fonds propres plutôt que par endettement.  
Seconde priorité : améliorer l’éducation économique et financière des publics. 
C’est le devoir des professionnels que de bien éclairer leurs clients sur la nature des 
investissements réalisés, et sur les risques qu’ils comportent : avec l’AMF, l’ACPR y 
veille pour les banques et les assurances ; le contrôle des pratiques commerciales 
reste de compétence nationale. Mais les Français doivent aussi être mieux équipés 
pour faire leurs choix de placements financiers en toute connaissance de cause. La 
Banque de France vient d’être désignée opérateur de la stratégie nationale 
d’éducation économique et financière des publics par le ministère des Finances. 
 
 
5 
 
C’est une mission que nous prenons très à cœur. À ce titre, nous coordonnons les 
actions des services publics, associations et professionnels, pour fournir à nos 
concitoyens un maximum de clés pour bien comprendre les questions budgétaires, 
économiques et financières du quotidien. Nous avons franchi une étape très 
concrète la semaine dernière avec l’ouverture du nouveau portail d’information « mes 
questions d’argent.fr ». 
** 
 
L’économiste écossais Adam Smith disait déjà en 1776 dans La Richesse des 
nations : « le principe qui nous pousse à épargner, c’est le désir d’améliorer notre 
sort ». Le sujet de l’épargne est un sujet légitimement sensible, car il touche au 
patrimoine des Français. Mais je crois essentiel que sur ce sujet sensible notre pays 
parvienne à mener une réflexion d’ensemble, collective et rationnelle. Le Parlement y 
a beaucoup travaillé et les Rencontres d’aujourd’hui contribuent à ce débat 
nécessaire. En nous donnant les moyens d’une épargne plus productive, nous 
améliorerons non seulement le sort des épargnants français, mais aussi le sort de 
toute notre économie. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence Banque de France-France Stratégie – 1
er
 février 2017 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
« Productivité : une énigme collective ? » 
 
Bienvenue à toutes et à tous. C’est avec un grand plaisir que j’ouvre cette 
conférence, organisée en partenariat avec France Stratégie, sur la productivité française. 
C’est à la fois un sujet d’actualité et un sujet d’importance pour les banques centrales : la 
productivité est l’un des principaux vecteurs de la croissance et sa dynamique commande 
fortement celle de la croissance potentielle, celle compatible avec la stabilité des prix. 
Comme vous pouvez le voir [slide], après la grande vague de croissance des Trente 
Glorieuses, particulièrement marquée en France, la productivité des économies avancées a 
ralenti par palier depuis les années 1970. Elle est revenue aujourd’hui à un rythme de 
croissance historiquement faible. Quels sont les facteurs communs dans ce ralentissement 
de la productivité ? Et existe-t-il en outre une spécificité française ? Je ne le crois pas : si 
spécificité française il y a, c’est celle d’une productivité horaire élevée – une des plus 
élevées au monde avec les États-Unis et l’Allemagne ; et donc davantage qu’une énigme 
française, l’énigme que nous examinons ce matin me paraît collective. Je voudrais revenir en 
introduction sur les trois hypothèses collectives en présence, avant de m’interroger, 
néanmoins, sur quelques facteurs spécifiques à la France.  
*** 
1. S’agit-il d’un problème de mesure de la croissance ?  
 
La première hypothèse est qu’il n’y a pas de ralentissement, car nous mesurerions mal la 
croissance en raison de l’avènement de l’économie numérique. Le 16 janvier dernier, la 
Banque de France a organisé une conférence
1
, qui a notamment traité de ce sujet pour 
l’économie américaine. Les principales sources d’erreurs de mesure sont, d’une part,

banque-de-france-et-le

l’estimation des prix des nouvelles technologies corrigés de la qualité, dont la baisse est 
sous-évaluée par la comptabilité nationale américaine, et d’autre part, les entrées et sorties 
de produits, qui rendent plus difficile l’estimation des évolutions de prix dans le temps. Ceci 
pourrait conduire à réévaluer très significativement la croissance de la productivité 
américaine depuis 1983 : de 1,1 point par an selon Philippe Aghion et ses coauteurs en 
estimation haute. Néanmoins, ces corrections ne remettent pas en cause le ralentissement 
constaté depuis le milieu des années 2000. En effet, les erreurs de mesures étaient tout 
aussi importantes sur la période précédente. Ces travaux peuvent amener  néanmoins à un 
certain optimisme. D’une part, la croissance dans les secteurs technologiques, et donc le 
progrès technique, sont plus forts que nous ne le pensions. D’autre part, certains gains de 
bien-être liés aux nouvelles technologies sont hors du champ de l’économie marchande et 
donc de la comptabilité nationale. L’économie numérique a notamment permis un gain de 
temps de loisirs, par exemple en simplifiant certaines démarches administratives, développé 
des services gratuits, sans que ces bénéfices n’apparaissent dans la mesure de la 
production, et fait croître l’économie du partage (en C to C), délicate à comptabiliser. Notre 
conférence d’aujourd’hui sera l’occasion de se pencher sur le cas français grâce à une 
présentation de l’INSEE. 
 
2. Un ralentissement structurel de la contribution du progrès technique à la 
croissance de la productivité ?  
 
S’il y a bien ralentissement de la productivité, la deuxième hypothèse est celle d’un 
ralentissement de l’innovation et de sa contribution à la productivité. La grande vague de 
productivité des Trente Glorieuses en France était alimentée par des progrès dans un grand 
nombre de domaines : progrès technique avec l’électricité, le moteur à explosion, la chimie 
ou les télécommunications, mais également par l’apparition de nouvelles organisations du 
travail et de pratiques de management. Aujourd’hui, quelle est la contribution potentielle à la 
croissance des technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) ? La première 
vague TIC a été courte, de faible ampleur et a été peu ressentie dans de nombreux pays, 
dont la France. Ceci fait douter certains économistes, dont Robert Gordon, d’une contribution 
majeure de ces technologies dans le futur. Mais pour un pays comme la France, qui 
bénéficie pourtant déjà d’un niveau élevé de productivité, des marges de progression 
significatives existent en matière de diffusion des TIC, en délai de diffusion comme en 
quantité. [slide] Le stock de capital en TIC constitue une part sensiblement plus faible du PIB 
en France par rapport aux États-Unis ou au Royaume-Uni. Un rattrapage apporterait des 
gains substantiels de croissance à la France.  
 
3 
 
3. Troisième hypothèse, une pénurie d’investissement ? 
 
Le rattrapage de la frontière technologique nécessite des investissements en TIC, ainsi 
qu’en recherche et développement. Ces investissements sont essentiels pour incorporer les 
innovations dans le processus de production. Or, ils sont plus risqués que les autres types 
d’investissement, par exemple dans la construction. En effet, ils combinent notamment 
valeur de revente faible ou inexistante et revenu futur plus incertain. Comme toute 
l’économie de l’innovation, ils nécessitent donc un financement adapté, privilégiant les fonds 
propres plutôt que la dette. Toutefois, le coût des fonds propres est resté élevé en dépit de la 
forte baisse des taux d’intérêt sur les vingt dernières années. Ainsi, selon les calculs de la 
Banque de France, le coût nominal des capitaux propres demeure entre 8 % et 9 % pour les 
grandes entreprises cotées en France, alors que le taux sans risque se situe autour de 0 %. 
Ce coût particulièrement élevé pèse sur l’investissement, l’innovation et l’évolution de la 
productivité. 
 
4. Des facteurs spécifiques à la France ?  
 
Certaines spécificités françaises pourraient pour autant jouer un rôle dans le ralentissement 
de la productivité. J’en citerai trois : 
 
<U+F0B7> D’abord, les déficiences de notre système de formation initiale et continue, soulignées 
par les enquêtes de l’OCDE PISA et PIAAC [slide]. La France se distingue en effet par 
un niveau général moyen au sein de l’OCDE, mais surtout par de fortes inégalités liées à 
l’origine sociale des parents. 
<U+F0B7> Ensuite, la composition de l’investissement des entreprises privilégie la construction au 
détriment des machines-équipements et de l’investissement immatériel. Il est au passage 
essentiel que les banques françaises financent mieux l’immatériel qu’elles ne le font 
aujourd’hui. 
<U+F0B7> Enfin, les caractéristiques du marché du travail français et les politiques associées. 
Certains travaux mettent en évidence des facteurs comme le raccourcissement de la 
durée des CDD. Il existe aussi des interrogations sur l’effet des politiques de l’emploi. 
Comment combiner soutien à la productivité et soutien à l’emploi ? Les politiques visant à 
abaisser le coût du travail peu qualifié, que ce soient les allègements de charge ciblés ou 
le CICE, ont un effet positif sur le PIB par tête au travers de l’augmentation du taux 
d’emploi mais elles peuvent avoir des effets préjudiciables sur la productivité, notamment 
quand elles visent des secteurs peu productifs. Autrement dit, ces politiques rendent 
d’autant plus nécessaire une amélioration de notre système de formation initiale et 
4 
 
professionnelle, sauf à favoriser un enchaînement à la baisse de la qualification des 
emplois et de la productivité.  
*** 
Au-delà de ces questionnements, il y a un constat clair pour la France : la croissance trop 
lente en 2016 - à 1,1 % - telle que publiée hier l’a confirmé, toutes les estimations réalisées 
par les institutions nationales et internationales aboutissent à des niveaux faibles de 
croissance potentielle, de l’ordre de 1,2 %, et des niveaux relativement élevés de taux de 
chômage structurel (l’équivalent du « NAIRU » anglo-saxon), d’au moins 9 %. De tels 
niveaux ne peuvent évidemment nous satisfaire. Ceci renvoie sans équivoque au besoin de 
réformes sur les « 4E » : Entreprises, Éducation, Emploi et État. L’exemple de nos voisins 
d’Europe du Nord montre que ces réformes sont compatibles avec notre modèle social 
européen partagé. Les travaux réalisés à la Banque de France indiquent en particulier que 
des réformes sur les marchés de biens et services pourraient faire augmenter la productivité 
de l’économie française entre 3 et 5 % à long terme. Sans plus tarder, je laisse la parole à 
Fabrice Lenglart, et vous souhaite à toutes et à tous des débats fructueux et une excellente 
conférence.

Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-Editori –  
Florence, 7 février 2017 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Bonjour à toutes et à tous. Je remercie sincèrement l’Osservatorio Permanente Giovani-
Editori et son président, Andrea Ceccherini, de m’avoir invité. Je suis très heureux d’être 
parmi vous cet après-midi, avec la jeunesse italienne, dans un pays que j’aime. Un pays qui 
est au cœur de l’Europe et qui a souvent marqué son histoire, comme nous le rappelle votre 
magnifique ville de Florence, et la gloire de son Quattrocento, berceau de toute la 
Renaissance européenne. Mais un pays qui doute aujourd’hui de l’Europe. Je viens devant 
vous, à la suite d’Ignazio Visco, Jean-Claude Trichet, Jens Weidmann et Klaas Knot, comme 
banquier central, mais aussi comme Européen convaincu. Et, en ce 7 février, c’est de l’euro 
que je veux vous parler : cela fait aujourd’hui 25 ans, jour pour jour, que nous avons signé le 
traité de Maastricht. Et cela fait désormais 18 ans que l’euro existe et 15 ans qu’il a remplacé 
dans nos porte-monnaie la lire italienne et le franc français. Je veux vous dire d’abord ce que 
la monnaie unique a apporté concrètement aux Européens et répondre ensuite à quatre 
doutes que l’on entend souvent à propos de l’euro. Je veux parler enfin de ce qui nous reste 
à faire, demain, ensemble.  
 
 
** 
I. L’euro nous a apporté à tous quatre bénéfices majeurs  
Maastricht et l’euro s’inscrivent bien sûr d’abord dans une histoire qui les dépasse : l’histoire 
de l’Europe, et de son élan unique au monde pour passer enfin de la guerre à la paix. Cette 
histoire-là n’a rien perdu de son actualité dans le monde si incertain de 2017. De grands 
Page 2 sur 9 
 
Italiens en ont été des acteurs essentiels, et notamment Alcide de Gasperi ou Altiero Spinelli. 
Mais je veux vous citer aussi un Allemand presqu’inconnu, Josef Müller, fondateur de la CSU 
bavaroise, qui a été déporté en camp de concentration durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale ; 
en 1946, il a été un des premiers à dire : « nous avons besoin d'une monnaie européenne, 
car des pays qui partageront une monnaie ne se feront plus jamais la guerre ». En 1990-
1992, le temps était venu : parce que l’Union allemande devait s’accompagner de plus 
d’Union européenne ; et parce que la disparition du bloc soviétique conduisait le continent 
européen à revenir dans le jeu mondial. Alors, de Rome en 1990 où nous avons lancé la 
conférence intergouvernementale – je me souviens du Palazzo Madama – à Maastricht en 
1992, nous avons bâti l’euro. Et d’autres Italiens ont continué à en être les auteurs, de 
Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa à Mario Draghi aujourd’hui. 
Nos fondations sont en partie politiques, donc ; mais l’édifice a aussi de solides charpentes 
économiques. Et ce sont ces quatre bénéfices tangibles, concrets, que je veux maintenant 
préciser. Il y a les trois avantages d’une monnaie solide : la stabilité des prix ; la stabilité des 
financements ; la stabilité des changes. Et il y a en conséquence la reconnaissance de notre 
monnaie au plan international.  
 
a) La stabilité des prix, condition du pouvoir d’achat 
L’euro permet d’abord de bien assurer la stabilité des prix, c’est-à-dire à maîtriser l’inflation. 
Cela est essentiel pour préserver le pouvoir d’achat des ménages et, face aux incertitudes, 
pour bâtir la confiance dans la valeur de la monnaie. 
Avant l’euro, l’inflation pouvait atteindre des niveaux parfois très élevés en Europe. Sur les 
quatorze années précédant l’euro (1985-1998), l’inflation a baissé progressivement mais elle 
est restée supérieure à 3 % en moyenne, avec des écarts importants entre les pays : 5,1 % 
en Italie et 2,6 % en France par exemple. Sur les quatorze années depuis l’euro, l’inflation a 
nettement diminué – sur la période 1999-2012 nous étions à 2 % en moyenne – mais 
également les écarts entre les pays se sont réduits : sur la même période, l’Italie n’a connu 
que 2,2 % d’inflation. On a trop oublié l’érosion de valeur – et donc de confiance – 
qu’entraînait l’inflation. En quatorze années, l’inflation cumulée avec la lire avait atteint 98 % 
; sur la même durée, avec l’euro, elle est près de trois fois moindre. À partir de 2013, 
l’inflation a même été trop basse dans la zone euro, et c’est la raison pour laquelle la BCE 
mène, avec succès, depuis 2014, une politique monétaire active. 
En pratique, la cible de la BCE est une inflation à moyen terme proche de, mais inférieure à 
2 %. Cette définition n’a pas varié depuis qu’elle a été adoptée en 2003 et elle est largement 
partagée aujourd’hui par toutes les grandes banques centrales des pays développés, y 
Page 3 sur 9 
 
compris aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni. Dans le contexte actuel, il est important de 
rappeler que la politique monétaire vise un objectif interne (la maîtrise de l'inflation), pas un 
objectif externe (un taux de change dévalué, qui pourrait conduire à de mauvaises réactions 
en chaîne). Pourquoi 2 % et pas 0 % ? Pour garder une marge de sécurité, car une inflation 
trop faible est aussi néfaste qu’une inflation trop forte : elle crée le risque de la déflation, 
c’est-à-dire un cercle vicieux de baisse générale et durable des prix, qui provoque une chute 
de l’activité et une hausse du chômage. De plus, une inflation légèrement positive met de 
l’huile dans les rouages de l’économie, par exemple quand il existe des rigidités sur le 
marché du travail ou des différences entre régions de la zone euro. 
 
 
b) La stabilité des financements à travers la baisse des taux d’intérêt 
La maîtrise de l’inflation entraîne ensuite une baisse des primes de risque exigées par les 
marchés : cela se traduit par des taux d’intérêt plus faibles en zone euro, et surtout par 
moins d’écarts entre les pays, les « spreads ». Prenons l’exemple de nos pays respectifs. 
Avant Maastricht, entre 1986 et 1992, le spread entre l’Italie et l’Allemagne était de 5,1 % en 
moyenne ; il n’était plus que de 1,4 % en 2016 ; il y a eu certes des tensions en 2011-2012, 
liées directement aux doutes qui ont un moment existé sur la pérennité de la zone euro. Pour 
la France, l’écart s’est réduit aussi, de 1,9 % entre 1986 et 1992 à 0,3 % en 2016. Le spread 
français peut aussi réagir temporairement à des incertitudes politiques, mais l'ancrage 
durable dans l'euro reste notre meilleure protection. Tous les acteurs économiques 
bénéficient des taux d’intérêt plus faibles : les ménages – lorsqu’ils achètent un bien 
immobilier – et les entreprises qui investissent, mais aussi les États et donc les 
contribuables. Certains critiques voudraient sortir de l’euro pour pouvoir faire plus de déficits 
sans être bridés par les règles européennes. C’est une utopie : le financement des déficits 
coûterait nettement plus cher aux pays de la zone euro hors de la monnaie unique, si l’on 
devait revenir aux spreads d’avant l’euro.  
 
c) La stabilité des changes et la solidité du marché unique  
L’euro permet également de consolider le marché unique, que les États européens ont 
construit pas à pas depuis le traité de Rome de 1957, il y a soixante ans. Pour permettre une 
plus grande intégration commerciale, il fallait réduire les fluctuations des monnaies : l’Europe 
l’a d’abord tenté, à partir de 1979, avec le système monétaire européen, organisé autour 
d’une monnaie commune, l’ECU. Mais ce mécanisme n’a pas suffi à éviter les attaques 
spéculatives : il faut se souvenir de la crise violente de septembre 1992 qui a forcé la lire 
Page 4 sur 9 
 
italienne à en sortir et à perdre 21 % de sa valeur, et qui a déstabilisé l’économie 
européenne. La monnaie unique a mis fin à ces graves turbulences. Elle simplifie aussi 
considérablement la vie : il n’y a plus de frais de conversion de monnaie pour les particuliers 
; il n’y a plus non plus d’incertitudes liées à la volatilité des taux de change pour les 
entreprises. Pour beaucoup d’entre elles, y compris les imprenditori italiens, leur marché 
domestique s’est élargi naturellement de leur seule base nationale à l’ensemble de la zone 
euro. Selon les études empiriques, l’euro a ainsi fait augmenter de 5 à 15 % le commerce 
entre les pays membres
1
.  
 
d) Une monnaie reconnue au plan international 
La taille économique de la zone euro et la stabilité de sa monnaie permettent enfin à l’euro 
de peser au niveau international. Avant l’euro, en 1995, seul le Deutsche Mark comptait dans 
les réserves de change mondiales à hauteur de 15 %. Aujourd’hui, notre monnaie partagée 
représente 20 % des réserves mondiales, au deuxième rang derrière le dollar. Avoir une 
monnaie reconnue au plan international procure des gains économiques : les marchés 
financiers sont plus attractifs pour les investisseurs étrangers, plus liquides, et donc plus 
efficients. Mais aussi un poids politique : je peux témoigner que quand Mario Draghi parle au 
G7 ou au G20, le monde entier écoute l’Europe avec attention. Sur une scène financière 
mondiale devenue très agitée, cette union est notre meilleure chance ; aucun de nos pays ne 
pèserait isolément. Notre souveraineté passe nécessairement par cette souveraineté 
européenne. 
** 
L’euro nous a apporté plus de solidité, et donc plus de confiance dans la monnaie : c’est un 
acquis considérable au milieu de tant d’incertitudes. L’euro nous a aussi apporté, bien sûr, 
un puissant signe d’unité des peuples européens. De 12 au départ, le nombre de pays 
participants est d’ailleurs monté à 19 aujourd’hui : 7 pays ont souhaité démocratiquement 
rejoindre l’euro, aucun n’a voulu le quitter. Ce sont bien ces bénéfices concrets économiques 
qui fondent l’attachement des 340 millions de citoyens de la zone euro à leur monnaie, à 
notre monnaie. Mesuré depuis l’origine, cet attachement est resté élevé à travers la crise. 
70 %

 soutiennent aujourd’hui l’euro, soit le plus haut niveau depuis 2008 ; les soutiens à 
l’euro sont très majoritaires aussi en France (68 %). Ils le restent en Italie même si c’est à un 
niveau moins élevé (53 %). L’euro n’est pas une utopie technocratique : c’est une décision

politique, démocratique, soutenue 25 ans après - à l’expérience - par une nette majorité des 
peuples.  
 
II. Pourtant il y a quatre doutes sur l’euro. Il faut y répondre avec sérieux, même si je crois 
que ce sont des idées non fondées.  
 
a) L’euro serait l’ennemi de la croissance et de l’emploi 
Des voix s’élèvent pour dire que l’euro est un frein à la croissance, à l’emploi, à la 
compétitivité. Pourtant, en 2016 la croissance de la zone euro à 1,7 % a été un peu 
supérieure à la croissance américaine (1,6 %) et surtout il y a de grands succès 
économiques dans la zone euro. Parmi les 35 pays de l’OCDE, la deuxième croissance du 
PIB réel la plus forte
3
, c’est l’Irlande à 4,3 % en 2016
4
, et l’Espagne croît également 
fortement, à 3,2 % ; la dette publique la plus faible à la fin de l’année 2016, c’est l’Estonie, 
avec 9,5 % du PIB
5
 ; plusieurs pays de la zone, dont l’Autriche et l’Allemagne, sont 
quasiment au plein emploi, entre 4 et 6 % de chômage en 2016
6
; l’Estonie et la Finlande sont 
dans le top 3 des meilleurs scores en sciences au test PISA. Donc ce n’est pas l’euro qui est 
en cause, ce sont les différentes politiques nationales. 
Certes, l’euro nous a fait perdre l’instrument de la dévaluation de la monnaie. La dévaluation 
peut avoir un effet bénéfique à court terme en faisant baisser le prix des exportations, mais, 
à moyen terme, ses effets négatifs sont potentiellement considérables : un effet inflationniste 
via le renchérissement du prix des importations ; un effet d’appauvrissement du pays, via la 
diminution de valeur de son patrimoine, et à l’inverse l’augmentation de ses dettes 
extérieures ; et enfin, elle crée le risque d’une guerre commerciale, avec des dévaluations en 
chaîne, comme ce fut le cas dans les années 1930. Nous avons en moyenne un taux de 
change adapté avec l'euro. Mais aucun succès durable dans l’histoire économique ne s’est 
construit sur une monnaie faible ; tous se sont bâtis sur le bon environnement structurel, 
l’innovation des entreprises, leur bonne spécialisation. La créativité italienne, votre génie 
commercial depuis Venise, Gênes et Florence, comptent beaucoup plus que la facilité d’une 
lire faible.

b) L’euro serait une « assurance tous risques » pour les États 
Cette vision semble être inverse de la précédente ; en fait elle procède de la même erreur de 
perspective : faire porter à l’euro un excès de maux ou de bienfaits. Une monnaie, c’est une 
valeur nominale essentielle ; mais ce n’est pas elle qui fait seule la performance réelle de 
l’économie. Dans la première partie des années 2000, une fois acquis ce gain collectif qu’a 
été l’euro, France et Italie comme d’autres pays du Sud ont cru, à tort, pouvoir relâcher 
l’effort de compétitivité, qui est pourtant un impératif permanent – « There is no free lunch ». 
Nous en subissons aujourd’hui les conséquences : [nous avons moins de croissance 
économique et moins d’emploi que certains de nos voisins européens, comme l’Allemagne 
et l’Espagne, qui ont su mener les réformes nécessaires pour les entreprises, l’emploi, 
l’éducation et l’État.  
Notre retard de croissance n’est pas dû, contrairement à ce que certains disent, à la 
discipline budgétaire excessive. Le ratio dette publique/PIB a plus que doublé en Italie 
depuis 1980, et il a été multiplié par cinq en France. Quand ma génération avait 18 ans, la 
dette s’élevait à 20 % du PIB en France. Pour votre génération d’aujourd’hui, la dette frôle 
les 100 % du PIB en France et en Italie, c’est même plus de 130 %. Nous avons manqué la 
solidarité intergénérationnelle, et au développement durable. Et que je sache, la France 
comme l’Italie ne sont pas, pour autant, devenues les championnes d’Europe de la 
croissance. Ce qui fait le retard de la France et de l’Italie aujourd’hui, c’est l’insuffisance de 
réformes nationales. Cela, l’euro ne peut pas, et ne pourra jamais, le remplacer. Et c’est une 
bonne nouvelle : il reste un grand espace pour nos politiques nationales, pour nos débats 
collectifs, pour notre mobilisation créative. 
 
c) La politique monétaire européenne serait facteur d’inégalités  
Pour certains, les taux bas que la BCE génère actuellement créeraient des inégalités 
sociales : les épargnants en produits à taux fixe seraient pénalisés du fait de rendements 
plus faibles, les détenteurs d’actions ou d’immobilier seraient favorisés grâce à la hausse 
des prix d’actifs. La réalité est différente. D’une part parce que les épargnants et les 
détenteurs d’actifs sont en général les mêmes personnes. D’autre part, et surtout, parce que 
ce jugement très partiel omet l’impact macroéconomique de la politique monétaire, qui profite 
à tous. Nos mesures créent des conditions de financement très favorables, qui stimulent la 
demande via la consommation et l’investissement, et accélèrent la baisse du chômage. Tout 
ceci contribue à la baisse des inégalités, car le chômage frappe d’abord les plus pauvres et 
Page 7 sur 9 
 
les moins qualifiés
7
. Selon les estimations, à la suite de notre action, l’économie de la zone 
euro aura gagné 1,5 % de croissance sur la période 2015-2018.  
Sur les inégalités, c’est d’ailleurs justement le moment pour nous Européens de parler de 
notre expérience. Nous partageons un modèle social commun, auquel nous sommes très 
attachés, avec un niveau élevé de services publics et des inégalités nettement inférieures à 
celles qui existent ailleurs, aux États-Unis par exemple. La bonne réponse aux inégalités, ce 
n’est donc pas un changement de politique monétaire. Ce n’est pas davantage le 
protectionnisme, même si les règles du commerce mondial doivent davantage profiter à tous. 
La bonne réponse aux inégalités, c’est de développer le bon modèle social. 
 
d) L’euro serait dans les mains des technocrates de Francfort 
Oui, Francfort est en Allemagne… comme Bruxelles est en Belgique. Mais oui tout autant, la 
BCE appartient à tous : ni aux Allemands – ce que tendent à croire les Italiens – ni aux 
Italiens – ce que tendent à croire les Allemands. Avec l’Eurosystème, c’est-à-dire la BCE et 
les 19 banques centrales nationales, nous avons depuis 1999 un vrai système fédéral qui 
fonctionne. Nous prenons nos décisions de façon collégiale au sein du Conseil des 
Gouverneurs, nous les appliquons ensuite dans chacun de nos pays.  Les effectifs de la 
BCE – du centre – ne représentent que 5 % du total de l’Eurosystème. Le poids de la France 
et de l’Italie dans la décision est donc beaucoup plus grand aujourd’hui : avant l’euro, de fait, 
nos politiques monétaires suivaient de près celle de l’Allemagne.  
Et pour garantir que nous agissons dans l’intérêt général de l’ensemble de la zone euro, pas 
de tel ou tel pays, les banques centrales de l’Eurosystème sont indépendantes de toute 
pression. Cette indépendance est parfois contestée, mais elle est un atout : nous devons 
durablement nous dédier au mandat qui nous a été confié – la stabilité des prix et de la 
monnaie. Cette indépendance est donc strictement cadrée : un objectif clair ; l’obligation de 
rendre régulièrement compte des résultats aux citoyens et à leurs élus ; et une procédure de 
nomination démocratique de chacun des responsables. 
 
 
III. Ce qui nous reste à faire, demain, ensemble 
L’euro nous a apporté des avantages majeurs de solidité et de confiance, d’unité et de 
souveraineté, je vous les ai rappelés. Il suscite des questions, j’ai voulu y répondre et 
souligner que l’euro n’est pas responsable de tout. Mais nous ne sommes pas au bout du

chemin. Nous ne pouvons pas nous voiler la face devant l’euroscepticisme qui existe en 
Europe, et le cas extrême du Brexit. J’aime cette maxime attribuée à Dante, un des grands 
Florentins : « Certains attendent que le temps change ; d’autres le saisissent avec force et 
agissent ». Mais quelle est la direction à prendre ? Moins d’Europe ? Ce serait une erreur si 
nous voulons maîtriser collectivement notre destin dans ce monde nouveau, marqué par les 
critiques directes et les actions unilatérales du nouveau Président américain. Ce dont nous 
avons besoin, ce n’est pas forcément de plus d’Europe, mais d’une « meilleure » Europe : 
une Europe moins dispersée dans les détails, plus concentrée sur quelques priorités et plus 
efficace. Une Europe qui parle moins et qui agit plus : « peu, bien, jusqu’au bout. ». 
Il y a bien sûr des domaines non-économiques : la formation des jeunes - je crois, avec 
Enrico Letta, à un programme «  Erasmus-pro » pour les apprentis - le changement 
climatique, la défense et la protection des frontières par exemple. Dans le domaine 
économique, nous pouvons être fiers de nos réussites – notre monnaie unique, notre marché 
unique et notre modèle social commun. Mais pour compléter le succès de l’union monétaire, 
nous devons impérativement progresser sur la voie de l’union économique. Il y a pour cela 
deux leviers concrets . 
 
a) Une « Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » 
La première étape, dès maintenant, c’est une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation» (UFI). Pourquoi ? Dans des économies proches ce qu’on 
appelle de la « frontière technologique », comme c’est le cas en France et en Italie, 
l’innovation est la clé de la croissance économique, et pas seulement pour les start-ups. Le 
problème, c’est qu’il y a aujourd’hui en Europe des entreprises qui veulent investir et innover, 
mais qui ne trouvent pas les financements adaptés, notamment en fonds propres. Et 
pourtant, les ressources ne manquent pas : la zone euro a plus de 350 milliards d’euros 
d’excédent d’épargne, soit plus de 3 % du PIB. C’est considérable. L’UFI doit permettre de 
mieux mobiliser cette épargne abondante en faveur de l’investissement.  
Pour cela, il faut bien sûr s’appuyer sur les initiatives qui existent déjà au niveau européen : 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux, le Plan d’investissement Juncker et l’Union bancaire. Mais 
il faut créer des synergies entre elles et aller plus loin.  
 
b) Davantage de réformes nationales et une meilleure stratégie économique 
collective 
Quand chaque État agit sans se préoccuper de ses voisins, nous nous retrouvons tous dans 
une situation sous-optimale. Sans aucun doute, la croissance et l’emploi seraient plus forts 
Page 9 sur 9 
 
dans la zone euro si les pays s’engageaient à davantage de réformes structurelles là où 
elles sont indispensables, comme en France et en Italie, et davantage de soutien budgétaire 
ou salarial là où des marges de manœuvre existent, comme par exemple en Allemagne. 
Mais nous devons pour cela recréer la confiance entre pays. D’abord en accélérant les 
réformes chez nous - France et Italie - : c’est notre intérêt national, je l’ai dit. Ensuite, pour 
que cette stratégie collective existe, la zone euro a besoin d’une institution de confiance, qui 
incarne et qui fasse vivre l’engagement commun des États. Cette institution de confiance 
pourrait être un « Ministre des Finances » de la zone euro, légitime démocratiquement. Il 
pourrait aussi, dans certaines conditions, disposer d’un « budget de stabilisation » européen 
pour amortir les chocs conjoncturels dans certains États ; une des formes possibles, à 
discuter, pourrait être un dispositif mutualisé d’indemnisation du chômage comme proposé 
par le Ministre Pier Carlo Padoan. 
*** 
Permettez-moi de conclure avec les mots de Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ce grand Toscan et 
président de la République italienne, qui vient malheureusement de disparaître. « Ce qui a 
été réalisé en Europe, dans les domaines économique et politique semble à chaque fois trop 
important pour être mis en danger : tellement important que cela donne aux gouvernements 
et aux peuples le courage de faire encore d’autres progrès […]. À cet égard, la création de 
l’euro est non seulement un aboutissement, mais aussi un point de départ.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
« La relation franco-allemande - expériences et défis à l'ère de l'euro »  
Mayence - 21 mars 2017 
 
 
Madame la Ministre Présidente [Mme Dreyer], Madame la Ministre des Finances  
[Mme Ahnen], Monsieur le Porte-parole du Directoire [M. Dexheimer], Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui à Mayence et je vous remercie 
sincèrement de m’avoir invité. Si vous me permettez une note personnelle, je viens ici comme 
Européen convaincu et comme ami de l’Allemagne. L’amitié franco-allemande me tient 
particulièrement à cœur : je suis Français et je vis à Paris, mais j’ai mes racines familiales dans le 
Land voisin du vôtre, en Sarre. Ma famille y vit depuis la fin du 18
ème
 siècle et fait partie du 
« Mittelstand » allemand avec la manufacture de porcelaine Villeroy & Boch. Quand je passe mes 
vacances en Sarre et que je vais vers le Nord, j’admire Trèves ; vers l’Est, Neustadt an der 
Weinstraße. Et quand je viens tous les quinze jours au Conseil des Gouverneurs de la BCE, je 
suis très près de votre belle ville de Mayence.  
Je suis intimement convaincu que « notre chance pour nous, citoyennes et citoyens de 
l’Union européenne, c’est d’être unis », pour reprendre les mots de la déclaration de Berlin du  
25 mars 2007. C’était pour le cinquantième anniversaire du Traité de Rome ; cela vaut toujours 
alors que nous allons dans quatre jours célébrer son soixantième anniversaire. Et pourtant, notre 
unité peut paraître menacée aujourd’hui : l’euroscepticisme monte, porté par les courants 
populistes partout en Europe ; le Brexit a gagné au Royaume-Uni en juin dernier ; et le nouveau 
gouvernement américain ne cache pas ses doutes vis-à-vis de la construction européenne. Face à 
ces turbulences, nous ne devons pas baisser le drapeau européen. Rappelons-nous le formidable 
- 2 - 
chemin que nous avons parcouru depuis que nos deux pays ont décidé d’unir étroitement leurs 
destins en signant le Traité de Rome, avec la Belgique, l’Italie, le Luxembourg et les Pays-Bas. 
Aujourd’hui, nous partageons trois atouts économiques majeurs en Europe : la monnaie unique, le 
marché unique et notre modèle social commun. Nous les avons construits ensemble et nous 
pouvons en être fiers. Ce sera mon premier point. Pour l’avenir, l’unité européenne continue d’être 
à mes yeux la meilleure réponse à apporter à toutes les interrogations. Et pour cela, l’amitié 
remarquable dont ont fait preuve nos deux pays doit continuer à nous inspirer. Comme le disait 
déjà le chancelier Konrad Adenauer en 1963 : « Imaginez, si cette amitié [entre la France et 
l’Allemagne] n’existait pas, toute tentative de créer l’Europe serait d’emblée condamnée à 
l’échec. »
i
 Ce sera mon second point. 
 
I. Ce que nous partageons aujourd’hui en Europe : nos trois atouts économiques.  
 
Permettez-moi de commencer par nos succès partagés. Nous avons aujourd’hui en Europe 
trois atouts économiques majeurs : notre monnaie unique, notre marché unique et notre modèle 
social commun. 
Premier atout : l’euro. C’est une monnaie solide qui est reconnue dans le monde entier. 
Les citoyens de la zone euro y sont très majoritairement attachés : à 70 % selon le dernier 
Eurobaromètre
ii
. Et contrairement à ce que suggèrent certains critiques, notre politique monétaire 
n’est pas une fantaisie latine. Elle est largement en accord avec les valeurs allemandes que je 
partage totalement : l’indépendance, le respect des Traités, la stabilité des prix, le long terme. 
Nous la décidons de façon collective au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs et nous prenons très au 
sérieux le mandat qui nous a été confié : assurer la stabilité des prix. Cela signifie une inflation ni 
trop forte, ni trop faible : notre cible à moyen terme est une inflation inférieure à, mais proche  
de, 2 %. Notre politique monétaire nous a permis d’éviter le danger mortel de la déflation qui 
menaçait la zone euro sur la période récente. Aujourd’hui, l’inflation remonte en zone euro, 
conformément à ce que nous avions annoncé. Nous sommes passés d’une baisse de 0,2 % en 
avril 2016 à une progression de 2 % le mois dernier, due un peu exceptionnellement aux prix de 
l’énergie. Au-delà des fluctuations transitoires, l’inflation devrait atteindre en moyenne 1,7 % sur 
l’année 2017, 1,6 % en 2018 et 1,7 % en 2019.  
Deuxième atout : nous partageons un grand marché unique qui appartient collectivement 
aux États membres de l’Union européenne. C’est une formidable avancée pour le commerce 
européen. Ce n’est pas pour rien que l’accès au marché unique est au cœur des débats qui 
entourent le Brexit. Bien sûr, nous ne pouvons pas préjuger du résultat des négociations qui vont 
avoir lieu, mais un principe de cohérence s’impose : l’accès au marché unique doit continuer 
d’aller de pair avec le respect strict de toutes ses règles. Il ne peut pas y avoir d’Europe « à la 
 
 
3 
 
carte » (cherry-picking), ni de « passager clandestin » (free-riding). Et nous devons évidemment 
préserver la politique commerciale européenne unique si nous voulons continuer de peser dans 
les négociations commerciales à venir dans le monde entier. 
Troisième atout : notre modèle social commun en Europe. On en parle plus rarement, 
mais c’est au fond ce qui définit l’Europe continentale, c’est ce que nos deux sociétés et nos deux 
opinions publiques allemandes et françaises partagent. Notre modèle social combine un haut 
niveau de service public, des inégalités relativement faibles – nettement moins fortes que dans la 
société américaine – et une bonne intensité des négociations sociales. Et ceci au sein d’une 
économie de marché. Je souligne combien cette économie sociale de marché est une réponse 
aux débats du monde anglo-saxon, plutôt que le protectionnisme : l'Allemagne, comme nombre de 
pays européens, montre qu'on peut allier le succès économique et la cohésion sociale, avec moins 
d'inégalités.  
Nous pouvons être fiers de ces trois atouts que nous avons construits ensemble. Mais pour 
l’avenir, alors que certains semblent ne plus croire aux bénéfices du projet européen, nous ne 
pouvons pas nous contenter d’être attentistes, nous ne pouvons pas simplement nous reposer sur 
nos atouts. 
 
II. Ce que nous devons construire pour l’avenir : une meilleure Europe pour maîtriser notre 
destin commun. 
 
Comment réagir ? Pas par moins d’Europe. Ce serait une erreur si nous voulons maîtriser 
collectivement notre destin dans ce monde nouveau. Mais par une « meilleure » Europe, moins 
dispersée dans les détails, plus concentrée sur ses priorités et plus efficace. Pour cela, l’Europe a 
besoin de l’énergie de l’Allemagne et de la France, et de leur remarquable amitié. Je veux ici citer 
le chancelier Helmut Kohl : « Les Allemands et les Français doivent former ensemble le noyau 
d’une Union européenne, d’une union qui ne se comprend pas uniquement comme un marché 
commun, mais comme la communauté de valeurs d’une libre démocratie, comme un État de droit 
et un État social »
iii
. Je ne vous parlerai pas ce soir du débat électoral français, vous le 
comprendrez : je dirai juste que comme amis de la France, vous ne devez pas sous-estimer la 
force de ses institutions. Je vous parlerai moins encore du débat électoral allemand. Mais je vous 
dis une conviction forte : après ces rendez-vous démocratiques, les gouvernements de nos deux 
pays, quels qu’ils soient, devront se retrouver, pour décider de quelques projets bilatéraux 
partagés, et préparer surtout une initiative commune pour l’Europe. Parce que pour l’Allemagne 
comme pour la France, l’autre pays est sans aucun doute aujourd’hui le meilleur partenaire 
- 4 - 
possible : il n’y a pas aujourd’hui d’alternative sérieuse, ni à l’Est ni à l’Ouest pour l’Allemagne, ni 
au Sud pour la France. Et parce que si notre initiative commune ne suffit pas à faire la décision 
européenne – il y a légitimement d’autres pays et la Commission autour de la table –, elle en est 
une condition nécessaire : s’il n’y a pas de moteur franco-allemand, la voiture européenne restera 
à l’arrêt.  
Les projets pour une meilleure Europe doivent être choisis avec soin et priorisés ; et nous 
ne devons pas simplement en parler. Nous devons nous donner les moyens pratiques, par une 
gouvernance efficace, d’obtenir des résultats concrets. En quelques mots : peu, mais bien et 
jusqu’au bout. Il y a bien sûr des domaines non-économiques : pour en citer quelques-uns, la 
défense et la protection des frontières, le changement climatique ou l’éducation et la formation des 
jeunes – un programme Erasmus Pro devrait être une priorité pour mettre fin au drame de la 
jeunesse sans emploi ni diplôme. Mais dans le domaine économique, il reste beaucoup à faire 
également. Comme le disait souvent Helmut Schmidt, nous devons construire une union 
économique en complément de l'union monétaire. Il faut à mes yeux avancer sur deux projets. 
Premier projet, dès à présent : une « Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation ». La Commission européenne a initié le plan d’investissement Juncker et l’Union des 
marchés de capitaux, et l’Union bancaire est désormais en marche. Mais il est aujourd’hui 
nécessaire de faire converger ces initiatives, dans l’intérêt des épargnants comme des entreprises 
européens. L’Europe a besoin d’un meilleur partage du risque privé, pour mieux mobiliser son 
épargne abondante en faveur du financement des investissements productifs. Comme je l’ai dit 
l’année dernière dans un article commun avec Jens Weidmann, le financement des entreprises 
par fonds propres, à travers les frontières de l’Europe, doit être une priorité. L’Europe est très en 
retard dans ce domaine : les fonds propres des entreprises ne représentent que 67 % du PIB dans 
la zone euro contre 125 % aux États-Unis. En conséquence, l’innovation, plus risquée par nature, 
est moins bien financée en Europe.  
Deuxième projet, sur lequel nous pourrons avancer après les élections qui vont avoir lieu 
cette année : une stratégie économique collective en zone euro. Je sais que lorsque les 
Français parlent de coordination en Europe, les Allemands pensent parfois qu'il pourrait s'agir 
d'une nouvelle astuce pour éviter les réformes. Il faut sortir de cette impasse : il nous faut à la fois 
des réformes nationales et une coordination européenne. La croissance et l’emploi seraient plus 
forts en Europe avec davantage de réformes structurelles là où elles sont nécessaires, comme en 
France et en Italie, et davantage de soutien budgétaire ou salarial là où des marges de manœuvre 
existent, comme en Allemagne. S’agissant des réformes, je souhaite aussi comme vous que la 
France accélère ; je le dis souvent dans mon pays. Mais ne jugez pas votre voisin 
« irréformable ». Ces dernières années, la France n’est pas restée sans rien faire : les retraites ont 
été réformées, les charges pesant sur les entreprises ont été nettement réduites, les engagements 
de réduction du déficit ont été tenus. En pratique, pour que la coordination européenne puisse 
 
 
5 
 
exister, la zone euro a besoin d’une institution de confiance entre les pays. C’est pour cela que j’ai 
proposé, après d’autres, la création d’un ministre des finances de la zone euro. Il incarnerait et 
ferait vivre l’engagement commun des États membres. A l’inverse, la priorité n’est pas à mes yeux 
de construire une « Union de transferts » et une capacité fiscale commune. 
** 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher disait dans une précédente crise européenne, dans les années 
1980 : « Scepticisme et pessimisme sont aussi mauvais conseillers que l'égoïsme national. »
iv
 Oui, 
nous aimons chacun notre pays, notre Nation. Mais oui aussi, l’amitié franco-allemande peut être 
ce rempart dont nous avons besoin aujourd’hui contre le scepticisme et le pessimisme ambiants. 
L’amitié, ce n’est pas un propos rituel de fin de banquet, c’est une exigence parfois difficile, mais 
toujours concrète car incarnée dans des projets. Elle doit continuer à inspirer le projet européen, 
cette volonté collective unique au monde dont nous devons être fiers. Comme banquier central, la 
décision ne m’appartient bien sûr pas. Ma responsabilité commune avec les autres gouverneurs 
de la zone euro est de mener une politique monétaire conforme au mandat qui nous a été confié, 
et de faire des propositions pour que les autres politiques économiques soient plus efficaces. C’est 
ce que j’ai esquissé devant vous avec ma conviction d’Européen. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Süddeutsche Zeitung Finance Day 2017, Frankfurt am Main, 22 mars  
« L’avenir du secteur financier : entre austérité et innovation » 
 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de Francei 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui et je vous remercie 
sincèrement de m’avoir invité. Je suis ici à Francfort en tant qu’Européen 
convaincu et ami de l’Allemagne ; et ce n’est pas seulement parce que je 
viens ici au moins deux fois par mois pour les réunions du Conseil des 
gouverneurs de la BCE ! Si vous me permettez une note plus personnelle, je 
suis français mais j’ai mes racines en Sarre. Ma famille y vit depuis la fin du 
18e siècle et sa manufacture de porcelaine Villeroy & Boch fait partie du 
« Mittelstand » allemand.  
 
Mais aujourd’hui, pour discuter de l’avenir de l’industrie financière, je vais 
parler en qualité de membre du Conseil des gouverneurs et de président de 
l’autorité française de surveillance (l’APCR). Tout d’abord, je voudrais dire 
quelques mots sur la politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème et sur nos 
dernières décisions. Ensuite, je partagerai avec vous mes réflexions sur les 
réponses qu’il convient d’apporter aux défis qui se posent actuellement à 
l’industrie financière. Il ne s’agit pas d’une question secondaire pour les 
banquiers centraux, car nous avons désormais la responsabilité de la stabilité 
financière, en plus de la stabilité des prix. En outre, un secteur financier solide 
Page 2 sur 9 
 
et rentable est l’une des conditions préalables à la bonne transmission de 
notre politique monétaire.   
 
I. En matière de politique monétaire, où en sommes-nous dans la zone 
euro ? 
 
Je suis pleinement conscient du débat animé qui existe ici, en Allemagne, 
autour de notre politique monétaire. Ce débat est parfaitement légitime, mais 
essayons de rester rationnels et de ne pas l’aborder dans un registre 
émotionnel. « Mehr Licht! » (plus de lumière !) si vous me permettez de citer 
les derniers mots de Goethe. C’est exactement ce que je voudrais faire 
aujourd’hui : mettre en lumière nos motivations et les progrès que nous avons 
accomplis.  
Comme vous le savez, la BCE a été conçue sur le modèle de la Bundesbank, 
et je pense que la politique monétaire collective de l’Eurosystème est tout à 
fait en phase avec les valeurs allemandes que je partage et admire : 
l’indépendance, le respect des Traités, la stabilité des prix et une approche de 
long terme. La stabilité des prix étant la mission qui nous a été confiée par les 
Traités européens, nous avons le devoir de nous consacrer en priorité à cet 
objectif. La stabilité des prix signifie un taux d’inflation se situant à un niveau 
inférieur à, mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme. Telle est notre définition 
depuis 2003 et c’est une définition que partagent la plupart des banques 
centrales des pays développés, ce que Jean-Claude Trichet appelle à juste 
titre « une grande convergence ». Notre ciblage d’inflation au sein de la zone 
euro n’a donc rien de nouveau ou de spécifique ; et notre politique monétaire 
actuelle n’est pas une fantaisie latine incontrôlée.  
 
Dans les faits, la zone euro a connu une remarquable période de stabilité des 
prix jusqu’à la crise. Mais à partir de 2013, l’inflation est tombée bien 
Page 3 sur 9 
 
au-dessous de 2 %. Notre mission nous imposait de réagir afin de ramener 
l’inflation à des niveaux plus sains pour nos économies. Et nous progressons 
clairement vers nos objectifs. Notre politique monétaire fonctionne ; les 
mesures que nous avons mises en place depuis 2014 ont d’ores et déjà été 
couronnées de succès.  
Tout d’abord [diapositive 2], nous avons évité le danger mortel de la déflation, 
et l’inflation remonte progressivement dans la zone euro. L’inflation totale a 
atteint un pic de 2 % le mois dernier, contre - 0,2 % en avril 2016. La remontée 
importante - et en partie temporaire - observée au début de cette année est 
essentiellement due au rebond des prix de l’énergie et des produits 
alimentaires, l’inflation sous-jacente restant inférieure à 1 % (et à 1,2 % en 
Allemagne). Toutefois, l’inflation sous-jacente devrait remonter 
progressivement pour s’établir à 1,8 % en 2019. Nous sommes 
raisonnablement confiants dans le fait que l’inflation totale et l’inflation 
sous-jacente convergeront et seront proches de notre cible en 2019 ; et cette 
convergence, qui n’est pas souvent soulignée, constitue un élément clé de nos 
prévisions, car elle est essentielle à la soutenabilité à moyen terme de 
l’évolution de l’inflation.  
Ensuite, le caractère accommodant de notre politique monétaire a assuré des 
conditions financières très favorables : les prêts accordés aux entreprises et 
aux ménages ont continué d’augmenter dans la zone euro, bien qu’à un 
rythme raisonnable (+2,3 % pour les entreprises et +2,2 % pour les ménages 
en janvier 2017) et les coûts d’emprunt ont sensiblement diminué.  
Enfin [diapositive 3], la reprise économique se raffermit et se généralise. Fort 
heureusement, il semble qu’il s’agisse d’une tendance mondiale : le 
communiqué issu de la réunion du G20 à Baden-Baden la semaine dernière 
commençait par ces mots « Nous nous sommes réunis à un moment où la 
reprise économique mondiale progresse », tout en soulignant également qu’il 
subsistait des risques et incertitudes importants. La politique monétaire de la 
zone euro a joué son rôle dans ce redressement, et les dernières projections 
Page 4 sur 9 
 
établies par les services de la BCE prévoient une accélération de la 
croissance du PIB pour la région, à 1,8 % en 2017. Le taux de chômage de la 
zone euro est descendu à 9,6 % en janvier de cette année, son niveau le plus 
bas depuis 2009. Et la reprise se généralise également dans les différents 
pays de la zone euro, y compris en France : malgré une certaine incertitude 
politique temporaire liée à l’approche des élections, les perspectives 
économiques de la France s’améliorent. Il faut reconnaître que le pays n’a pas 
été inactif ces dernières années en matière de réformes : les retraites ont été 
réformées, les charges pesant sur les entreprises ont été nettement réduites 
et la législation du travail a été rendue plus flexible. Comme vous, je voudrais 
que la France accélère le rythme des réformes ; je le dis souvent dans mon 
pays. Mais ne jugez pas votre voisin français « irréformable ». Ces réformes 
sont essentielles, car la politique monétaire ne peut évidemment pas être 
la seule partie à jouer, et de moins en moins à mesure que nous 
comblons progressivement notre écart de production.   
 
Maintenant, la question qui vient à l’esprit, tout particulièrement ici en 
Allemagne, est la suivante : étant donné ces progrès, devrions-nous arrêter de 
poursuivre une politique monétaire accommodante ? À ce stade, clairement, la 
réponse est non. Sans stimulus monétaire, la reprise de l’inflation ne pourrait 
pas encore être auto-entretenue ou durable dans l’ensemble de la zone euro. 
C’est pourquoi nous maintenons une orientation accommodante tout en 
adaptant son intensité. À cet égard, nous avons décidé de réduire nos achats 
mensuels d’actifs de 20 milliards d’euros (revenant de 80 milliards à 
60 milliards) à partir du mois prochain ; nous n’avons pas jugé nécessaire de 
lancer une nouvelle série d’opérations de refinancement à plus long terme 
ciblées (TLTRO) après la dernière qui se déroule aujourd’hui ; et nous avons 
clairement souligné - notamment Mario Draghi et moi-même - les limites des 
taux d’intérêt négatifs.  
Page 5 sur 9 
 
Je voudrais ajouter les précisions suivantes : je lis souvent des commentaires 
décrivant notre débat au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs comme un débat 
« prédéterminé », entre les faucons d’un côté et les colombes de l’autre. Je ne 
pense pas que cela soit exact : dans toutes nos décisions de politique 
monétaire, je crois que ce qui compte est une approche pragmatique, basée 
sur une évaluation approfondie de l’environnement économique actuel de la 
zone euro et de la structure spécifique de ses canaux de financement. C’est 
ce qui explique l’évolution de notre forward guidance, basée sur les 
informations dont nous disposons actuellement. Mais nous avons clairement 
donné aux secteurs financier et économique une visibilité sur le volume de nos 
achats mensuels pour l’ensemble de l’année 2017.  
 
II Quels sont les défis auxquels doit faire face le secteur financier et 
comment les relever ? 
Un secteur financier sain est fondamental pour une reprise économique solide. 
Je voudrais rappeler que des progrès significatifs ont été réalisés dans ce 
domaine depuis la crise financière. Ne jugeons pas le secteur financier 
européen uniquement sur ses dossiers difficiles ou sur les établissements qui 
font partie du « wagon de queue » ; il est en moyenne bien plus résistant 
aujourd’hui qu’avant la crise. C’est le résultat du travail considérable qui a été 
effectué pour renforcer la réglementation et harmoniser la surveillance dans la 
zone euro - notamment avec l’Union bancaire, qui constitue une avancée 
majeure. Cela tient également aux efforts remarquables fournis par l’industrie 
bancaire elle-même : les banques européennes sont aujourd’hui bien plus 
solides qu’il y a dix ans, en termes tant de fonds propres que de liquidité ou de 
prise de risques. S’agissant de leurs fonds propres par exemple, le ratio de 
base de catégorie 1 des grands groupes bancaires de la zone euro est passé 
de moins de 7 % en 2008 à plus de 14 % aujourd’hui. Dans l’ensemble, les 
banques présentent maintenant moins de risques et les investisseurs 
devraient tenir compte de cette amélioration et réduire leurs taux de 
Page 6 sur 9 
 
rendement attendus : les coûts des fonds propres bancaires devraient 
diminuer. 
 
Cependant, si la solvabilité s’est améliorée, les banques européennes doivent 
encore relever un défi : celui la rentabilité [diapositive 4]. Certes, le 
rendement moyen des fonds propres varie fortement entre les pays, la France 
se classant parmi les plus solides dans la zone euro, mais il stagne autour 
de 5 %. Cette situation soulève trois questions portant sur trois facteurs 
possibles : les taux d’intérêt bas, les créances douteuses et la transformation 
digitale. 
 
Le premier facteur, celui qui est le plus fréquemment mentionné - 
excessivement parfois - est l’environnement de taux d’intérêt bas. Les 
sociétés d’assurance et les fonds de pension dont le niveau de garanties à 
taux fixe est élevé pourraient en souffrir. S’agissant des banques, leurs 
marges nettes ont été réduites par les taux d’intérêt bas et par l’aplatissement 
de la courbe des rendements. Cette question doit cependant être examinée 
sous tous les angles [diapositive 5]. La politique monétaire a aussi des effets 
compensateurs : les volumes de prêt ont de nouveau augmenté ; les banques 
ont enregistré d’importantes plus-values ; le coût du risque a baissé en raison 
de l’amélioration de la solvabilité des emprunteurs, le coût de financement, y 
compris celui du financement de marché et du financement de la BCE, est 
devenu plus faible. Dans l’ensemble, l’impact global de nos mesures non 
conventionnelles de politique monétaire sur la rentabilité des banques devrait 
être modeste pour la période 2014-2017. De plus, les taux d’intérêt nominaux 
s’inscrivent en légère hausse depuis le point de retournement observé 
en août 2016 et ce sont ces taux, et non les taux réels, qui importent pour la 
rentabilité des banques, ainsi que la pente de la courbe des rendements. 
 
Page 7 sur 9 
 
Le deuxième facteur pesant sur la rentabilité est le volume de créances 
douteuses [diapositive 6]. Il ne s’agit pas d’un problème très étendu : le ratio 
moyen de créances douteuses s’élève à 5,4 % dans l’Union européenne en 
septembre 2016 et, dans de nombreux pays, y compris la France et 
l’Allemagne, il est même inférieur à 4 %. Il constitue cependant un défi sérieux 
pour certaines banques dans quelques pays, principalement en Italie et au 
Portugal. Le problème est donc surmontable, mais il doit être effectivement 
surmonté et ce, aussi rapidement que possible. Les initiatives récentes des 
autorités italiennes vont dans la bonne direction, avec la participation active 
des autorités de surveillance européennes.  
 
Troisième facteur : la transformation digitale. C’est vrai, la digitalisation 
bouscule les modèles traditionnels de relation clientèle. Mais elle crée 
également des opportunités : par exemple, des services financiers plus 
diversifiés et plus accessibles, une satisfaction des clients plus complète, une 
meilleure valorisation des données. Toutefois, pour réussir la transition 
digitale, les sociétés financières doivent premièrement placer l’innovation au 
cœur de leur conduite stratégique, et deuxièmement examiner les façons de 
transformer leurs business models, surtout dans la banque de détail. Il est 
évident qu’il s’agit là de choix difficiles qui doivent être opérés par les 
entreprises elles-mêmes. Il ne revient pas aux régulateurs de décider des 
orientations stratégiques et celles-ci ne seront pas uniformes. Cela étant dit, 
permettez-moi de partager quelques réflexions avec vous. En ce qui concerne 
les revenus, la réponse pourrait être double : diversifier la gamme de services 
offerts aux clients, à la fois directement et par le biais de partenariats ; et 
ajuster les politiques de fixation des prix existantes : moins de prix forfaitaires 
et plus de tarification liée à la demande. Du côté des coûts, la transition 
numérique implique de se préparer à des évolutions des emplois et des 
qualifications, à travers un dialogue renforcé avec les partenaires sociaux. De 
plus, elle requiert d’importants investissements dans les technologies de 
l’information, pour fournir des services qui restent en phase avec les besoin 
Page 8 sur 9 
 
des clients, tout en réduisant les coûts structurels et en renforçant le respect 
de la réglementation. Les systèmes informatiques devront être – et c’est là 
toute la difficulté – à la fois plus sûrs, pour fournir une protection efficace 
contre les cyber-risques, et plus flexibles et propices à l’inter-connectivité.  
De toute évidence, notre devoir en tant que régulateurs dans le cadre de cette 
révolution n’est pas de décourager l’innovation, mais plutôt de garantir une 
égalité de traitement avec les fintechs, en tenant compte de leur cycle de vie 
selon un principe de proportionnalité, et encore plus à l’avenir avec des 
plateformes de données plus importantes, qu’il s’agisse des GAFA ou de leurs 
équivalents. Cette égalité de traitement devra s’appliquer pour les exigences 
de fonds propres ou de liquidité, pour la surveillance prudentielle, ainsi que 
pour la protection des données : tout le monde doit jouer le jeu selon les 
mêmes règles. 
Outre les ajustements des business models, la consolidation transfrontière des 
banques dans la zone euro contribuerait également à résoudre la question de 
l’efficacité. L’union bancaire fournit à la fois le fondement et le cadre 
nécessaires à une telle intégration financière ; à cet égard, nous accusons 
toujours un retard important par rapport au marché américain. Une 
consolidation transfrontière sur une base sûre rendrait les banques mieux à 
même de diversifier leurs risques au sein de la zone euro et d’orienter plus 
efficacement l’épargne vers les investissements transfrontières.   
  
En tant que régulateurs, il est évident que nous avons un rôle à jouer pour 
aider le secteur financier à s’adapter. Nous devons nous efforcer de réduire 
les incertitudes autant que possible.  
Aujourd’hui, le cadre réglementaire constitue une source d’incertitudes. Près 
de dix ans après la crise, notre priorité doit être la stabilisation des règles. Les 
principaux éléments du programme de réforme de Bâle III ont été approuvés 
dès 2010-2011 et sont largement entrés en vigueur. Mais il reste des 
discussions en cours concernant la mesure du risque dans les bilans des 
Page 9 sur 9 
 
banques. Vous le savez, l’objectif est de réduire la variabilité non justifiée des 
résultats entre les banques et entre les juridictions. Et comme l’a réaffirmé le 
G20 rassemblé en Allemagne la semaine dernière, l’achèvement des réformes 
ne doit pas se traduire par une « augmentation significative des exigences 
globales de fonds propres ». Nous ne sommes pas encore parvenus à un 
accord. Grâce à notre mobilisation et à celle de nos partenaires européens, 
nous avons évité un mauvais accord. Notre objectif pour les mois à venir est 
donc de parvenir à un bon accord.  
Le Brexit est une autre source d’incertitudes. Avec le déclenchement imminent 
de l’article 50, nous ne pouvons pas préjuger des résultats des futures 
négociations. Mais il est fondamental de garder à l’esprit ce principe : dans le 
cadre du marché unique, il est impossible de séparer l’accès et les règles. 
Dans le secteur des services financiers en particulier, on ne peut espérer 
disposer d’un passeport européen si l’on n’accepte pas les règles du marché 
unique. Soyons clairs : le Brexit nous attriste et ce n’est pas nous qui avons 
décidé de conduire un Brexit dit « propre ». Mais si c’est le chemin pris, il n’est 
pas question d’une Europe « à la carte », pas question de 
« Rosinenpickerei ». 
*** 
Près de dix années se sont écoulées depuis la crise financière et économique 
mondiale. Nous avons fait du chemin, mais il nous reste des défis à relever, 
pour ces dix prochaines années. Et les défis qui se posent à l’industrie 
financière changent progressivement de nature : ils pourraient glisser d’une 
adaptation à l’environnement réglementaire et de politique monétaire à une 
réflexion sur les nouvelles stratégies de modèles d’activité. À cet égard, le 
renforcement attendu de la reprise économique pourrait, espérons-le, rendre 
les choses plus faciles. L’austérité, ou le sérieux, demeurera nécessaire, mais 
l’innovation changera la donne. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

préparation de ces propos.

La politique monétaire de la BCE et la résilience de la zone euro1 
Université de Columbia, New York, 19 avril 2017 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Je vous remercie de m’avoir invité à l’Université de Columbia et à sa School of International and 
Public Affairs (SIPA). L’excellence académique de l’Université de Columbia est connue de tous. 
Ce que l’on sait peut-être moins, c’est qu’il existe une relation privilégiée de Columbia avec la 
France et en particulier avec mon institution, la Banque de France. Permettez-moi de préciser dès 
le début que je ne ferai aucun commentaire sur les événements actuels en France et sur notre 
élection présidentielle : je rappellerai simplement qu’il y a deux tours, le premier dimanche et le 
second le 7 mai. Dans de tels moments, il convient tout particulièrement de regarder au-delà du 
présent et de se placer dans une perspective de long terme.  
La Maison française a été créée sur le campus il y a cent ans. Votre département de français est 
l’un des meilleurs des États-Unis. J’ajouterai que la Banque de France a toujours suivi très 
attentivement et apprécié la production académique de Columbia, notamment deux concepts que 
j’utiliserai aujourd’hui : les travaux de Robert Mundell sur les zones monétaires optimales et ceux 
de Mike Woodford sur la forward guidance. Enfin, Patricia Mosser, qui est à présent Senior 
Research Scholar ici à la SIPA, a travaillé auparavant à la Fed de New York et plusieurs agents de 
la Banque de France ont eu le privilège de travailler avec elle au fil des années. Permettez-moi 
donc, Patricia, de vous remercier chaleureusement d’avoir organisé cette conférence sur la 
politique monétaire de la BCE et la résilience de la zone euro. En Europe, le processus de 
construction de l’euro est relativement bien connu, tandis que la politique monétaire de la BCE fait 
souvent débat. Aux États-Unis, il se pourrait que ce soit le contraire : la politique monétaire est 
souvent mieux comprise que le processus de construction de l’euro. Je vais par conséquent traiter 
successivement ces deux questions, avant d’aborder l’avenir et la nécessité d’agir en Europe. 
                                                 
1 Je remercie P. Antipa, L. Py, T. Mouakil, F. Haas, Ph. Andrade, B. Mojon et M. Dujardin pour leur aide dans la préparation de cette intervention.

1. L’euro a des fondements solides  
Les fondements politiques 
Comme vous le savez, la monnaie unique a été officiellement lancée en 1992, avec le Traité de 
Maastricht, et a été introduite en 1999. Mais Maastricht et l’euro font naturellement partie d’une 
histoire plus vaste : celle de l’Europe, et de sa réussite remarquable pour passer de la guerre à 
la paix. Dès 1946, Josef Müller, figure majeure de la résistance allemande au nazisme et 
fondateur de la CSU bavaroise, reconnaissait que : « nous avons besoin d’une monnaie 
européenne parce que les pays qui partagent une monnaie ne seront jamais en guerre ». De fait, 
l’euro nous a fourni un symbole fort d’unité entre les nations européennes. Il est vrai que l’on 
constate actuellement un certain euroscepticisme et une montée du populisme, mais une nette 
majorité de citoyens de la zone euro soutient l’euro aujourd’hui. C’est le cas dans tous les 
États membres en dépit des graves récessions économiques subies par certains pays. De douze 
au départ, le nombre de pays participants est passé à dix-neuf aujourd’hui. Sept pays 
supplémentaires ont décidé de rejoindre l’euro depuis 1999 – le dernier étant la Lituanie en 2015 – 
et aucun n’a souhaité le quitter. L’euro n’est pas une utopie technocratique : il s’agit d’une décision 
politique et démocratique, soutenue, avec le recul, par une nette majorité de citoyens depuis vingt-
cinq ans. 
 
Les fondements économiques et institutionnels 
Nos fondations sont en partie politiques ; mais l’édifice européen a également des bases 
économiques et institutionnelles solides. 
Dans le cadre d’une réflexion sur l’euro à l’Université de Columbia, le premier penseur qui vient à 
l’esprit est naturellement Robert Mundell et sa théorie des zones monétaires optimales, qui a 
été utilisée par de nombreux économistes pour analyser l’Union monétaire européenne et ses 
chances de succès. Mundell lui-même est resté un ardent défenseur de l’euro2. Il a mis en avant 
plusieurs arguments théoriques pour répondre aux critiques – notamment l’intégration financière et 
la mobilité des capitaux – tout en reconnaissant que l’UEM demeure sous-optimale (comme, dans 
une certaine mesure, l’union monétaire américaine). Comme Mundell l’a déclaré en 2012 : L’euro 
n’est pas seulement la cerise sur le gâteau pour le marché unique européen et l’Union européenne 
(UE), il est le ciment qui maintient la cohésion de l’Europe. 
Cela étant, un des arguments souvent avancés contre l’euro est qu’une monnaie ne peut pas 
exister sans un État. Il est vrai que la prérogative d’un gouvernement de battre monnaie a été

progressivement acceptée comme un attribut essentiel de souveraineté, liant l’État à l’offre de 
monnaie ; mais en réalité, l’État peut manipuler l’unité de compte au profit de ses propres finances, 
par exemple en monétisant la dette, et ces manipulations ne sont pas toujours, c’est le moins que 
l’on puisse dire, dans l’intérêt de la population. En conséquence, il me semble que l’ingrédient 
essentiel de la stabilité monétaire n’est pas l’État mais l’indépendance et la crédibilité de l’institut 
d’émission : la banque centrale – et ce principe est fermement établi dans la zone euro, ainsi que 
dans le droit français pour ce qui est de la Banque de France.  
Toutefois, pour sauvegarder notre indépendance, il faut davantage qu’une série de dispositions 
légales. Comme toute construction politique, l’euro prospèrera si, et seulement si, les citoyens des 
États membres de la zone euro sont convaincus que l’Eurosystème remplit, année après année, 
son mandat qui consiste à préserver la stabilité des prix. C’est également la raison pour laquelle 
nous sommes soumis à des règles en matière de responsabilité, prévoyant des auditions 
régulières devant la représentation des citoyens de l’UE, à savoir le Parlement européen et les 
Parlements nationaux, ainsi que la publication des minutes de nos réunions et de nos résultats. En 
résumé, l’indépendance garantit que la BCE puisse agir conformément à son mandat. La 
responsabilité garantit que la BCE agisse effectivement conformément à son mandat.  
Les bénéfices économiques de l’euro 
Le fait est que l’euro a déjà apporté des bénéfices concrets. Permettez-moi d’en citer trois. 
Premièrement, conformément à notre mandat, l’inflation a été maîtrisée. Le pouvoir d’achat des 
ménages en bénéficie directement et cela contribue à créer la confiance dans la valeur de la 
monnaie. Plaçons-nous dans une perspective historique. Sur les dix-huit années qui ont précédé 
l’introduction de l’euro (1981 – 1998), l’inflation a baissé progressivement mais elle est restée à 
4,6 % en moyenne, avec des écarts importants entre les pays. Sur les dix-huit années qui ont suivi 
(1999 – 2016), l’inflation a été beaucoup plus stable, à 1,7 % en moyenne, et les écarts entre pays 
se sont réduits.  
Deuxièmement, une meilleure maîtrise de l’inflation signifie un coût du financement plus faible, car 
elle réduit les primes de risque. Tous les acteurs économiques bénéficient des taux d’intérêt plus 
faibles : les ménages qui achètent un bien immobilier, les entreprises qui investissent, mais aussi 
les États et donc les contribuables. Les écarts de rendement (« spreads ») peuvent réagir 
temporairement aux incertitudes politiques, mais rester dans l’euro constitue toujours notre 
meilleure protection contre ces fluctuations. 
Troisièmement, l’euro a contribué à consolider le marché unique européen, en supprimant les 
fluctuations de change pour les entreprises, en simplifiant la vie quotidienne des citoyens et en 
favorisant l’intégration des marchés de capitaux. En outre, la taille économique de la zone euro et 
- 4 - 
la stabilité de sa monnaie ont permis à l’euro de jouer un rôle important au niveau international. 
Aujourd’hui, l’euro représente 20 % des réserves mondiales, au deuxième rang derrière le dollar. 
Avoir une monnaie reconnue au plan international procure des gains économiques : les marchés 
financiers sont plus attractifs pour les investisseurs nationaux et étrangers, plus liquides, et donc 
plus efficients. Mais cela représente aussi un poids politique : quand Mario Draghi parle au G7 ou 
au G20, le monde entier écoute l’Europe avec attention, exactement comme lorsque Janet Yellen 
s’exprime au nom des États-Unis.  
Globalement, la liste de ces bénéfices est impressionnante, surtout si l’on considère que l’euro n’a 
que dix-huit ans. Qui plus est, nous en sommes arrivés là malgré la crise financière mondiale, qui 
a provoqué la récession la plus profonde depuis trois générations, et malgré la crise de la dette 
souveraine dans la zone euro quelques années après.  
 
2. Je vais maintenant vous parler de la politique monétaire : l’euro a réussi le test de 
résistance aux crises. 
a. La politique monétaire 
La gestion de crise est une réussite 
L’Eurosystème a mis en œuvre une stratégie de politique monétaire innovante et déterminée, 
qui a contribué à stabiliser l’économie de la zone euro et à réduire les coûts des crises. Permettez-
moi de rappeler brièvement ce que nous avons accompli. Comme vous, nous avons d’abord eu à 
faire face aux conséquences de la faillite de Lehman Brothers. Comme de nombreuses autres 
banques centrales, nous avons réagi rapidement en offrant de la liquidité en quantité illimitée aux 
intermédiaires financiers, en abaissant fortement le taux de nos opérations principales de 
refinancement et en fournissant des lignes de swap internationales. Il ne s’agissait toutefois que 
de notre premier défi. L’épisode Lehman a ouvert la voie à la crise de la dette souveraine dans la 
zone euro et à son amplification via le lien entre banques et émetteurs souverains. Pour 
contrecarrer ces forces centrifuges, nous avons notamment mis en place une fourniture de liquidité 
en quantité illimitée pour une durée de trois ans au taux de nos opérations principales de 
refinancement et contre une gamme élargie de garanties éligibles en décembre 2011. Pour preuve 
de la crédibilité de notre engagement à faire « tout ce qui est nécessaire pour préserver l’euro », 
selon les termes de Mario Draghi en juillet 2012, il a suffi d’annoncer notre programme 
d’opérations monétaires sur titres pour atténuer les tensions sur les marchés financiers. 
Plus récemment, à partir de 2014, nous avons dû réagir face à un risque de déflation qui était lié 
à la conjonction de plusieurs facteurs : le ralentissement de la croissance mondiale, la chute des 
cours des matières premières et la faiblesse persistante de la demande intérieure. C’est pourquoi 
nous avons adopté un ensemble de mesures énergiques, comportant trois volets principaux : les 
 
 
5 
 
achats d’actifs, les indications sur la trajectoire future des taux (forward guidance) – deux mesures 
également mises en place par la Fed – et les taux d’intérêt négatifs. Le programme d’achats 
d’actifs – ou QE (assouplissement quantitatif) – a d’abord concerné des instruments de dette 
privés, puis également des titres du secteur public. Depuis avril 2017, et jusqu’à décembre 2017, 
les achats seront de 60 milliards d’euros par mois, contre 80 milliards auparavant. La mesure 
probablement la moins conventionnelle est l’utilisation de taux d’intérêt négatifs. Je souligne qu’il 
s’agit de la mesure la moins conventionnelle car pour la plupart des gens et dans tous les modèles 
économiques que je connais, les taux d’intérêt nominaux sont positifs. Le Conseil des gouverneurs 
de la BCE a pris la décision d’appliquer des taux négatifs pour la facilité de dépôt en juin 2014 et 
de les réduire à leur niveau actuel de – 0,4 % afin d’assouplir encore les conditions monétaires et 
financières. Peut-être précisément parce que ces mesures étaient si inhabituelles, elles nous ont 
aidés à convaincre les marchés que notre engagement en faveur de notre mandat était très solide. 
Cela étant, les taux d’intérêt négatifs ont des limites évidentes : ils sont difficiles à faire accepter 
par les ménages et les PME et donc, en pratique, il est impossible de les répercuter sur eux. De ce 
fait, beaucoup pensent qu’ils détériorent la rentabilité de l’intermédiation financière. Nous vérifions 
très attentivement que le maintien du taux de notre facilité de dépôt à son niveau actuel ne conduit 
pas les banques à réduire leur offre de crédit.  
 
Quels effets de nos mesures ? 
Je suis convaincu que l’ensemble de nos mesures non conventionnelles a fonctionné et fonctionne 
toujours. L’inflation remonte progressivement vers notre cible, qui est une inflation inférieure à, 
mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme : en mars 2017, la progression annuelle de l’IPCH dans la 
zone euro était de 1,5 %. Elle ne s’élevait qu’à 0,2 % pour l’année 2016. Les conditions 
financières se sont considérablement assouplies. D’après notre évaluation interne, notre 
politique monétaire a contribué à une baisse des taux d’intérêt à long terme de 100 points de base 
environ. Cette évolution est très significative. En période normale, nous aurions eu besoin d’une 
baisse cumulée des taux d’intérêt à court terme de l’ordre de 3 % 3  pour entraîner une telle 
réduction du taux d’intérêt à long terme. Nous avons également observé une baisse significative 
des taux débiteurs bancaires conjuguée à une hausse des volumes de prêts. Depuis mi-2014, les 
taux débiteurs bancaires appliqués aux entreprises ont baissé de plus de 100 points de base en 
moyenne dans la zone euro [cette baisse allant jusqu’à 130 points de base pour les prêts aux 
entreprises italiennes et le spread entre l’Italie et la France a diminué de 60 points de base entre 
janvier 2014 et février 2017]. Le rythme de croissance des prêts bancaires aux sociétés non 
                                                 
3 D’après la règle empirique qui avait été utilisée par John Williams, le président de la Fed de San Francisco. 
- 6 - 
financières est passé de -4 % fin 2013 à +2 % aujourd’hui. Les prêts bancaires accordés aux 
ménages sont également passés de taux de croissance négatifs à des taux de croissance positifs. 
En outre, la reprise économique est en train de se raffermir et de se généraliser. Au moment 
où je parle, nous enregistrons depuis quatorze trimestres une croissance régulière et 5 millions 
d’emplois ont été créés dans la zone euro depuis mi-2013, même si le chômage est encore trop 
élevé à 9,6 %. Cette reprise n’est ni assez rapide ni assez dynamique, mais elle a persisté en 
dépit d’un certain nombre de chocs mondiaux et nationaux. La croissance a été légèrement plus 
élevée dans la zone euro qu’aux États-Unis en 2016, et ne devrait pas en être très éloignée 
en 2017. 
 
Prochaines étapes pour la politique monétaire 
Alors que faut-il faire maintenant ? À l’évidence, l’environnement macroéconomique actuel ne 
nécessite pas de recalibrage. Notre orientation actuelle de politique monétaire demeure tout à 
fait appropriée sur la base des informations actuelles, comme l’a souligné Mario Draghi, et ne 
devrait pas faire l’objet d’un ajustement avant l’apparition de signes plus concrets que l’inflation 
peut se maintenir à des niveaux plus proches de notre objectif. Pour l’avenir, s’agissant de la 
manière la plus appropriée de réduire l’intensité de notre orientation accommodante lorsque cela 
deviendra souhaitable, nous devrions à mon sens suivre deux principes : celui de la prudence et 
celui de l’efficacité.  
Nous devons être prudents, car la reprise est encore fragile. Cela revient à se demander si 
l’ajustement de l’inflation vers notre objectif de taux inférieur à, mais proche de 2 %, se 
poursuivrait sans notre stimulus monétaire. Aujourd’hui, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE ne 
pense pas que ce soit le cas. L’inflation sous-jacente, qui exclut les prix du pétrole et des produits 
alimentaires, demeure inférieure à 1 % et devrait, selon nos prévisions, se redresser 
progressivement pour atteindre 1,8 % en 2019, compte tenu du rythme de hausse des salaires.  
Nous devons également être efficaces, au sens où, parmi les différents instruments que nous 
avons mis en œuvre, nous devrions retirer en dernier les mesures les plus nécessaires pour 
garantir un ajustement durable de l’évolution de l’inflation conforme à notre objectif. Nous 
continuerons d’évaluer la situation avec un grand pragmatisme. Il n’y a pas, au sein du Conseil 
des gouverneurs, de clivage prédéfini entre colombes et faucons, comme on l’affirme parfois. J’ai 
la conviction que notre stratégie future, tout comme la stratégie actuelle, sera le résultat d’une 
discussion et d’une décision collectives.  
 
b. Le cadre institutionnel  
Parallèlement, le cadre institutionnel de la zone euro a été amélioré en réponse à la crise. Les 
États membres ont franchi des étapes essentielles pour le renforcement de la résilience de la zone 
 
 
7 
 
euro dans le futur. Avec l’introduction du Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES) en 
octobre 2012, ils ont mis en place un puissant mécanisme de gestion de crise pour la zone euro. 
Avec sa capacité effective de prêt de 500 milliards d’euros, ce filet de sécurité donne aux pays de 
la zone euro en difficulté le temps nécessaire pour mettre en œuvre des mesures permettant de 
restaurer la viabilité des finances publiques, la compétitivité et la stabilité financière à moyen 
terme. Outre le MES, l’Union bancaire constitue une avancée majeure vers une plus grande 
intégration financière européenne et, donc, vers une union monétaire plus performante. Elle est 
désormais opérationnelle, et repose sur deux piliers. Le premier, depuis fin 2014, est le 
Mécanisme de surveillance unique. Il attribue à la BCE la responsabilité de la surveillance 
bancaire dans la zone euro, en coopération avec les autorités nationales de supervision, et il la 
charge de veiller à l’application cohérente de la réglementation dans la région. Le second pilier, 
depuis janvier 2016, est le Mécanisme de résolution unique. Il garantit que toutes les banques 
de la zone euro peuvent faire l’objet d’une résolution selon les mêmes règles et à coût minimal 
pour les contribuables et pour l’économie réelle.   
Mais nous devons également considérer ce qu’il nous reste à faire. D’autres étapes importantes 
pour l’Union bancaire sont en cours de discussion, avec comme priorité l’achèvement d’un pilier 
efficient pour la résolution. De plus, des problèmes subsistent pour certaines banques, notamment 
celui des créances douteuses en Italie et au Portugal. Ces problèmes sont surmontables, mais il 
faut maintenant s’y attaquer sérieusement et rapidement. Pour autant, ne jugeons pas le secteur 
financier européen uniquement sur ses dossiers difficiles ou sur les établissements qui font partie 
du « wagon de queue ». Dans l’ensemble, le système bancaire de la zone euro est bien plus 
résistant aujourd’hui : s’agissant des fonds propres par exemple, le ratio de base de catégorie 1 
des grands groupes bancaires de la zone euro est passé de moins de 7 % en 2008 à plus de 14 % 
aujourd’hui. Dans ce contexte, et dans le cadre de l’union bancaire, nous devons autoriser 
davantage de fusions transfrontières entre banques. Cela permettra aux banques de mieux 
orienter l’épargne, au-delà des frontières nationales, afin qu’elle se dirige là où se trouvent les 
besoins d’investissement. Et nous devrions, à l’évidence, préserver et finaliser la réglementation 
financière internationale des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Nous avons tout à gagner d’une 
coopération en matière de réglementation. La concurrence dans ce domaine serait destructrice. 
 
3. Comment je vois l’avenir de la zone euro : un appel à l’action.  
Cela m’amène à la question de l’avenir de la zone euro. Pour être franc, je vois un avenir 
prometteur, si nous agissons. Il y a certes des défis aujourd’hui, aussi bien à l’échelle nationale – 
euroscepticisme et chômage – que mondiale – incertitude à l’Ouest (États-Unis et Royaume-Uni) 
- 8 - 
ainsi qu’à l’Est. Mais je suis convaincu que la réponse aux défis actuels n’est pas « moins 
d’Europe ». Moins d’Europe serait une erreur si nous voulons rester maîtres de notre destin 
commun. Cela étant, il existe des possibilités d’amélioration, pour parvenir à une « meilleure 
Europe ». Il y a vingt-cinq ans, nous parlions d’une « Union économique et monétaire ». Depuis, 
nous avons fait de l’Union monétaire une réussite, mais nous n’avons pas été très efficaces sur le 
plan de l’Union économique. Les performances économiques plutôt satisfaisantes, en moyenne, 
de la zone euro masquent encore des hétérogénéités individuelles. [diapo] Ainsi, d’abord et avant 
tout, certains pays, comme la France et l’Italie, doivent accélérer les réformes structurelles 
nationales afin d’améliorer le fonctionnement et la flexibilité de leurs économies. Et, soyons c lairs, 
c’est dans notre intérêt national : la croissance économique et l’emploi dans notre pays sont 
actuellement plus faibles que chez certains de nos voisins, comme l’Allemagne, l’Espagne et les 
Pays-Bas, qui ont réussi à mettre en œuvre les réformes nécessaires.  
Pour parvenir à une « meilleure Europe », nous devons compléter ces réformes nationales par ce 
que j’appelle le « triangle de croissance » [diapo]. Cela requiert, au niveau européen, deux projets 
concrets, en plus des réformes nationales : une « Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation » ainsi qu’une stratégie économique collective. 
Premier projet, dès à présent : une « Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation », car la crise financière a conduit à une « pénurie d’investissement » persistante à 
l’échelle européenne. Et pourtant, ce n’est pas par manque de ressources : la zone euro affiche un 
excédent d’épargne de plus de 350 milliards d’euros, équivalent à plus de 3 % du PIB. C’est 
énorme. Plusieurs initiatives sont déjà en place : le Plan d’investissement de la Commission 
européenne (le « plan Juncker »), l’Union des marchés de capitaux et l’Union bancaire qui est 
désormais en marche ; mais ces initiatives ne donnent pas suffisamment de résultats. Il est 
aujourd’hui nécessaire de les faire converger au sein de l’Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation. L’Europe a besoin d’un meilleur partage du risque privé, afin de 
canaliser plus efficacement son épargne abondante vers l’investissement productif. Et le 
financement des entreprises par fonds propres, à travers les frontières de l’Europe, doit être une 
priorité. L’Europe est très en retard dans ce domaine : ce type de financement ne représente que 
67 % du PIB dans la zone euro contre 125 % aux États-Unis.  
Deuxième projet, sur lequel nous pourrons avancer après les élections françaises et allemandes 
qui vont avoir lieu cette année : une stratégie économique collective en zone euro. La 
croissance et l’emploi seront plus forts en Europe avec davantage de réformes structurelles là où 
elles sont une priorité – comme en France et en Italie – et davantage de soutien budgétaire ou 
salarial là où des marges de manœuvre existent – comme en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas. En 
pratique, pour que cette stratégie économique collective puisse exister, la zone euro doit 
surmonter le sentiment actuel de méfiance ; il lui faut ce que j’appellerais « un contrat de 
 
 
9 
 
confiance ». C’est pour cela que j’ai proposé, après d’autres, la création d’une institution afin de 
renforcer la confiance, qui pourrait être un « ministre des Finances » de la zone euro.  
* 
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure. Comme le disait Jacques Delors, président de la 
Commission européenne à la fin des années quatre-vingt et au début des années quatre-vingt-dix, 
« en Europe, il faut le pompier mais aussi l’architecte ». L’Eurosystème a été un pompier très 
efficace durant la crise, faisant de son mieux pour contribuer, dans le cadre de son mandat, à la 
construction d’une trajectoire de croissance plus dynamique dans la zone euro, par le biais de sa 
politique monétaire. Toutefois, le succès de la politique monétaire doit encore être complété d’une 
véritable union économique pour que le projet européen se réalise pleinement. C’est désormais la 
responsabilité des architectes, notamment des prochains gouvernements en France et en 
Allemagne.

Introduction du Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
au séminaire sur « les récents développements sur la politique monétaire » 
Paris, 4 mai 2017 
 
 
Notre monnaie, l’euro, est au cœur de débats importants pour les Français. La Banque de 
France est indépendante par rapport à la politique, mais au nom de notre mission dans la 
République qui est de garantir la confiance dans la monnaie, il m’appartient d’apporter 
quelques éclairages. On entend notamment avancer certaines hypothèses de double 
monnaie, avec retour à une monnaie nationale en parallèle d'une monnaie européenne : je 
me dois de dire que de telles hypothèses  mettraient en danger la confiance dans la 
monnaie. 
Cette double circulation n’existe dans aucun pays avancé. Ailleurs, là où il y a (ou bien il y a 
eu) deux monnaies qui circulent et avec lesquelles on peut payer, l'une inspire toujours 
moins confiance que l'autre. En général, c'est la monnaie ""nationale"" qui en souffre, la seule 
accessible aux ménages et notamment aux plus modestes, ainsi qu’aux PME… Et donc 
cette monnaie perd vite de sa valeur, avec des prix qui augmentent beaucoup trop et un 
impact négatif sur le pouvoir d’achat.  
Si on envisageait le retour à l'ECU, il faut rappeler que celui-ci n'existe plus depuis dix-huit 
ans et qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une vraie monnaie : l’ECU était une unité de compte, avec 
laquelle ni les particuliers ni les entreprises ne pouvaient payer. À supposer que ce soit 
possible, revenir à l’ECU présenterait de graves inconvénients par rapport à l'euro 
d'aujourd'hui : jusqu’à l’introduction de l’euro, la France de fait ne participait pas à la décision 
sur le niveau des taux d’intérêt, et devait suivre la politique monétaire allemande ; le Franc 
était à la merci d'attaques spéculatives des marchés financiers, épuisant nos réserves de 
change comme nous l'avons connu en 1992-1993. C’est pour régler ces problèmes que nous 
avons fait l’euro.  
 
 
2 
 
L'euro est aujourd’hui bien vivant. C’est la monnaie de 340 millions d'Européens et elle est 
reconnue dans le monde entier. C’est la monnaie de confiance des Français, qui la 
soutiennent pour près de 70 % d’entre eux. Parce que l’euro protège leur pouvoir d'achat 
avec des prix qui augmentent trois fois moins vite qu'avant ; parce que l’euro facilite leurs 
emprunts avec des taux d’intérêt de 1,5 % à 3 % plus bas ; parce que l’euro préserve la 
valeur de leur épargne.  
Je précise enfin que l’Eurosystème n’a bien sûr pas modifié sa politique d’achat de titres 
souverains en fonction des élections françaises. La répartition des achats mensuels entre les 
différents pays est basée sur le principe de la répartition du capital de la BCE.

pour faire progresser la culture financière : répondre aux besoins des jeunes 
24 Mai 2017 – Paris 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
sur la stratégie nationale d’éducation financière de la France 
 
Votre Majesté (Reine Máxima des Pays-Bas), Monsieur le Secrétaire général,  
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui pour ce symposium consacré à l’éducation 
financière. C’est en effet un sujet qui suscite de grandes attentes parmi les Français : [slide 2]  
78 % d’entre eux considèrent que l’éducation financière devrait être enseignée à l’école et 65 % 
pensent qu’elle permettrait de faire reculer le surendettement et les situations de fragilité 
financière
i
. Les travaux académiques initiés par Annamaria Lusardi et Olivia Mitchell
ii
 le 
confirment, comme ceux que nous avons pu mener pour la France
iii
. [slide 3] Si l’on se réfère aux 
trois questions « standard » portant sur les notions de taux d’intérêt, d’inflation et de diversification 
des risques, seulement 30 % des individus y répondent sans erreur, ce qui est inférieur à ce que 
l’on peut observer dans d’autres pays européens. De plus, parmi les Français, les plus jeunes font 
partie de ceux qui ont les moins bons résultats, avec les plus âgés. Mais il y a plus : un enjeu 
démocratique. Fournir à nos concitoyens les clés pour comprendre un débat économique 
complexe, c’est les respecter. Ce n’est pas la peine de nous lamenter sur le « populisme »  – 
étiquette au demeurant trop rapide – si nous ne savons pas donner aux « peuples » la capacité de 
poser les bonnes questions, et de juger des réponses.  
La France s’est donc résolument engagée dans la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie d’éducation 
financière, sur la base des principes élaborés par l’OCDE et adoptés par le G20. Les réflexions ont 
- 2 - 
commencé dès 2013 et, le 20 décembre dernier, le ministre de l’Économie a réuni le premier 
Comité national de l’éducation financière, qui rassemble les administrations et institutions 
concernées, des associations de consommateurs et des professionnels du secteur financier. Ce 
comité est celui qui donne l’impulsion politique au plus haut niveau. Le Ministre a également 
réaffirmé le rôle confié à la Banque de France d’opérateur de la stratégie nationale. Je veux 
m’arrêter quelques instants sur le rôle de la Banque de France, avant de vous présenter nos 
premières réalisations collectives.  
*** 
1. La Banque de France, chef d’orchestre de la stratégie nationale 
[slide 4] La Banque de France a une expérience concrète et quotidienne des besoins d’information 
et d’explication de nos concitoyens, au travers de ses trois grandes missions, les « 3 S », que sont 
la stratégie monétaire, la stabilité financière et les services à l’économie. Par exemple, dans le 
cadre de la procédure de surendettement dont nous sommes en charge, nous apportons chaque 
année une solution à plus de 200 000 ménages confrontés à des difficultés financières. Et depuis 
plusieurs années déjà, la Banque de France se mobilise pour l’éducation financière du grand 
public, et notamment des populations les plus jeunes : cela passe par la formation continue des 
enseignants, dans le cadre de nos 21 conventions académiques signées avec l’Éducation 
nationale grâce à notre présence sur l’ensemble du territoire, mais également [slide 5] par des 
projets ambitieux comme « Citéco », la Cité de l’économie et de la monnaie, un musée innovant et 
ludique qui ouvrira ses portes fin 2018 dans le 17
ème
 arrondissement de Paris, au sein de l’hôtel 
Gaillard rénové.  
Dans la stratégie française d’éducation financière, la Banque de France joue donc le rôle de chef 
d’orchestre [slide 6], pour mobiliser et coordonner les actions de toutes les parties prenantes, que 
ce soit les acteurs associatifs, institutionnels ou professionnels. Grâce à ces partenariats, nous 
pourrons ainsi assurer la démultiplication des actions de sensibilisation et de formation au bénéfice 
du plus grand nombre. Notre objectif collectif a trois dimensions [slide 7] : toucher tous les 
publics – les jeunes bien sûr, les enseignants et les étudiants, les personnes en situation de 
fragilité financière, mais aussi tous les citoyens tout au long de leur vie ; traiter tous les sujets – 
les questions budgétaires mais aussi financières et économiques, pour apporter dans chacun de 
ces domaines le socle de connaissances nécessaires pour mieux comprendre et donc mieux 
décider ; et enfin, utiliser tous les supports pertinents pour diffuser largement ces connaissances 
– site internet, actions de terrain, partenariats. 
 
2. La stratégie se met rapidement et concrètement en œuvre 
[slide 8] Nous avons mis en ligne, depuis le 24 janvier dernier, le portail  internet dédié à 
l’éducation financière : « mesquestionsdargent.fr ». Ce portail a vocation à devenir la référence 
 
 
3 
 
pour tous nos concitoyens à la recherche d’une réponse à leurs questions du quotidien, que ce 
soit en matière bancaire, budgétaire, économique ou financière. Un premier cap de 200 000 pages 
consultées a déjà été franchi. Ce portail permet un accès simple et rapide, en trois clics, à des 
contenus soigneusement sélectionnés pour leurs qualités pédagogiques, leur neutralité, leur 
fraicheur et leur gratuité. Nous avons opté pour une approche semblable à celle de la plateforme 
néerlandaise Money Wise : pratique avec un nombre limité d’entrées et de supports, partenariale 
avec des sources variées parmi l’ensemble des partenaires. 
Pour mettre en œuvre rapidement la stratégie nationale, nous nous appuyons sur le Comité 
opérationnel, que je préside, et qui est en charge du pilotage et de la coordination. Notre feuille de 
route pour l’année 2017 est claire : au premier semestre, définition des objectifs opérationnels et 
identification des moyens disponibles ; au second semestre, élaboration d’une méthodologie 
d’évaluation robuste et efficace.  
Nous travaillons d’ores et déjà activement à la mise en place de dispositifs spécifiques pour les 
personnes en situation de fragilité financière et les élèves.  
Pour les personnes en situation de fragilité financière, nous menons des travaux en concertation 
étroite avec les intervenants sociaux pour produire des supports pédagogiques et pratiques sur 
sept thèmes très concrets : budget, relation bancaire, crédit, incidents bancaires, inclusion 
bancaire, surendettement et réclamations. Dès le mois de juin 2017, ces supports seront mis à 
disposition des travailleurs sociaux et des associations, afin de pouvoir être utilisés auprès des 
personnes en situation de fragilité financière. D’ici à la fin de l’année, les équipes de la Banque de 
France ont prévu près de 900 réunions pour présenter en détail à 14 000 intervenants sociaux ces 
supports pédagogiques ainsi que le portail « mes questions d’argent ».   
Pour les élèves, le Ministère de l’Éducation nationale a mobilisé dès le mois de décembre 2016 un 
groupe d’experts, auquel participent activement la Banque de France et l’Institut d’éducation 
financière du public. Son objectif est de développer des ressources pédagogiques adaptées, pour 
permettre aux enseignants de sensibiliser les élèves, dès l’école primaire, aux notions d’argent, de 
budget, de crédit et d’épargne, et d’approfondir ces connaissances au  collège et si possible 
ensuite au lycée. Les premiers supports validés par le groupe d’experts seront mis à disposition 
des enseignants dès la rentrée de septembre 2017. La Banque de France les promouvra auprès 
des enseignants dans les académies, conformément au cahier des charges défini par le Ministère 
de l’Éducation nationale.  
*** 
Permettez-moi pour conclure de citer le musicien américain Pete Seeger, qui avait ce bon mot : 
« Connaissez-vous la différence entre l’éducation et l’expérience ? L’éducation, c’est quand vous 
lisez tous les alinéas d’un contrat. L’expérience, c’est ce qui vous arrive quand vous ne le faites 
- 4 - 
pas. »
iv
 Et j’ajouterai que l’éducation financière, c’est ce qui doit permettre de rendre tous ces 
alinéas compréhensibles. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

PRÉSENTATION DU RAPPORT ANNUEL  
DE L’AUTORITÉ DE CONTRÔLE PRUDENTIEL ET DE RÉSOLUTION 
POUR 2016 
Conférence de presse du lundi 29 mai 2017 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
J’ai le plaisir de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour la présentation du 7
ème
 rapport d’activité de 
l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), avec Bernard Delas, 
 vice-président de l’ACPR, Rémi Bouchez, président de la commission des sanctions, et  
Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, secrétaire général de l’ACPR.  
L’ACPR et ses 1046 agents ont, comme vous le savez, un large domaine d’action. L’ACPR 
est garante de la stabilité de notre système financier, par la supervision des banques et des 
assurances, mais elle est aussi garante de la protection de la clientèle et des épargnants 
français. Je veux d’abord rappeler notre implication indispensable tant en Europe qu’à 
l’international, puis les résultats des principaux groupes bancaires et d’assurance français, 
avant d’aborder quatre grands enjeux qui orientent fortement l’action de l’ACPR : les taux 
bas, le digital, la protection de la clientèle, la lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du 
terrorisme.  
*** 
I. L’ACPR inscrit son action en Europe et à l’international 
Au niveau européen, l’ACPR a pris une part active dans la poursuite du déploiement de 
l’Union bancaire. L’ACPR a grandement contribué au bon fonctionnement des équipes 
conjointes de supervision, qui assurent le contrôle des grands groupes bancaires français, 
avec 38 missions sur place. Dans le cadre du second pilier, le mécanisme de résolution 
unique, qui est entré en vigueur au 1
er
 janvier 2016, l’ACPR a activement préparé les plans 
2 
 
préventifs de résolution des quatre groupes bancaires français dits systémiques et les plans 
de résolution transitoires des autres groupes importants.  
Deux ans et demi d’Union bancaire, c’est un progrès sensible, mais cela ne fait pas encore 
une construction achevée : nous devons terminer le pilier « résolution », avec des règles 
complétées et plus simples entre MREL et TLAC, avec un fonctionnement plus efficace entre 
Francfort, Bruxelles et les autorités nationales. Les problèmes bancaires qui demeurent en 
Italie, au Portugal, voire ailleurs, sont traitables : mais ils doivent être traités vite, bien 
définitivement. Il n’est pas normal que des difficultés localisées pèsent à ce point sur l’image 
d’ensemble d’un secteur bancaire européen pourtant beaucoup plus solide qu’avant. 
Aujourd’hui la question se pose de l’architecture de la supervision et de la 
réglementation européenne. La Commission a en effet ouvert la revue triennale du 
fonctionnement des trois autorités européennes, en charge respectivement de la 
convergence dans la régulation des banques, des assurances et des marchés. À court 
terme, il est indispensable de relocaliser l’Autorité bancaire européenne pour tenir compte du 
Brexit. Les pouvoirs et la gouvernance des trois autorités pourraient également être ajustés 
pour renforcer encore leur efficacité, mais je ne pense pas utile, dans l’immédiat, de 
bouleverser l’architecture existante. Des changements plus importants – pouvant aussi 
rapprocher supervision et résolution – pourront être envisagés une fois que le Brexit sera 
effectif et que l’Union bancaire et l’Union des marchés de capitaux seront bien établies. A 
propos du Brexit, je veux redire une exigence qui est à nos yeux une évidence : les 
opérations de compensation en euros, pour toutes celles qui sont d’importance systémique, 
doivent être localisées là où la supervision de l’Eurosystème pourra s’exercer de manière 
effective. Et après le Brexit, on ne voit pas comment ceci pourrait être à Londres.  
 
II. Point sur les résultats 2016 des banques et assurances françaises 
Pour l’année 2016, dans un contexte marqué par le faible niveau des taux d’intérêt, les 
grandes banques françaises affichent de solides performances et se comparent 
favorablement à leurs homologues européens. Leur rentabilité a progressé, le résultat net 
part du groupe s’élevant à 24,3 milliards €, en hausse de 3,1 % sur l’année. De plus, le 
système bancaire français a su renforcer ses fonds propres de meilleure qualité, tout en 
préservant le financement à l’économie. Le ratio des fonds propres de base s’établit 
désormais à 13,2 % des risques moyens pondérés, en progrès de 60 pb par rapport à 2015 ; 
ceci représente une hausse des fonds propres de 164 milliards € depuis 2008 pour les 
principales banques, soit plus qu’un doublement : une augmentation de plus de 120 % en 
moins de 10 ans. En parallèle, avec un coût du risque en diminution de 20 % par rapport à 
3 
 
2015, les crédits accordés à l’économie sont restés dynamiques : + 4,9 % d’encours aux 
sociétés non financières et + 4,5 % aux ménages. Cette dynamique, la plus forte d’Europe, 
s’est encore accélérée à fin mars : + 5,3 % pour les sociétés non financières, + 5,6 % pour 
les ménages. Si la gestion de ces risques au niveau des établissements individuels n’appelle 
pas de remarques de l’ACPR, cette forte croissance d’ensemble peut mériter une vigilance 
globale et un examen par le Haut Conseil de stabilité financière auquel je participe.  
Pour le secteur de l’assurance, Bernard Delas vous donnera plus de détails, mais je note 
la situation satisfaisante des groupes d’assurance français avec un ratio médian de 
solvabilité de plus de 200 % fin 2016.  
Globalement, je tiens à le relever : le secteur bancaire et assurantiel français est solide, un 
des plus solides d’Europe et du G7. La qualité de notre supervision a contribué à cette 
solidité, qui est un des atouts de l’économie française.  
 
III. Quatre grands enjeux qui orientent l’action de l’ACPR  
Premier enjeu, dans nos activités de supervision des banques et des assurances : 
l’environnement de taux d’intérêt bas. Ceux-ci pèsent sur les marges des banques, 
principalement sur leur activité de détail, même si elles sont en partie protégées par la part 
élevée des commissions dans leurs revenus. Depuis le point de retournement de l’automne 
dernier, nous sommes cependant dans un scénario de remontée très graduelle des taux 
longs nominaux, et de « pentification » de la courbe des taux. C’est une évolution plus 
favorable à la rentabilité bancaire, qui pourrait se changer en faiblesse dans l’hypothèse 
d’une remontée brutale des taux : je ne crois pas cette hypothèse la plus probable. Mais 
l’ACPR reste donc particulièrement attentive à la surveillance des dispositifs de gestion du 
risque de taux mis en place par les banques. Le prochain exercice de stress test, 
actuellement en cours, examinera différentes hypothèses d’évolution des taux d’intérêt.  
S’agissant des assurances, la modération des taux servis en assurance-vie est nécessaire 
pour préserver leur solvabilité. C’est une tendance que nous avons heureusement observée 
en 2016 sur les supports en euros, même si le rendement moyen servi reste significatif à  
1,9 %. Le contexte de taux bas a également favorisé une réorientation de l’épargne vers les 
supports en unités de compte. L’ACPR est ici vigilante quant aux conditions commerciales 
de cette évolution. 
Deuxième enjeu : la montée en puissance de la finance digitale.  L’accompagnement des 
nouveaux acteurs est une priorité pour l’ACPR, que nous avons matérialisée par la création 
du pôle Fintech Innovation et du Forum Fintech avec l’AMF. Les Fintechs sont porteuses de 
solutions innovantes pour les clients, et très bienvenues, mais elles doivent, elles aussi, être 
4 
 
attentives à la protection des données, à la cyber-sécurité ou encore au respect des 
dispositifs anti-blanchiment. Mais l’enjeu digital, ce ne sont pas que les Fintechs. Ce peuvent 
être aussi demain les grandes plateformes numériques – les GAFA – et dès aujourd’hui la 
transformation des banques et des assurances. Celles-ci s’y sont engagées, beaucoup plus 
activement en 2016 ; c’est une des priorités de la supervision européenne en 2017 que de 
suivre les conséquences pour leurs business models. Et il faudra aussi concrétiser de 
nouvelles opportunités : l’exploitation éventuelle des données, en protégeant les clients et en 
veillant à une réelle égalité de concurrence avec les GAFA ; ou le développement de la 
cyber-assurance. 
Troisième enjeu : la protection de la clientèle des banques et assurances, qui est bien 
sûr l’une de nos missions essentielles. L’ACPR a reçu plus de 6500 courriers en 2016, soit 
une augmentation de près de 20 % en deux ans, et fait plus de 600 interventions auprès des 
organismes, établissements ou intermédiaires concernés. L’ACPR a aussi continué à se 
mobiliser pour la diffusion des bonnes pratiques, avec cinq recommandations adoptées ou 
révisées en 20161 visant notamment les nouvelles pratiques liées aux médias sociaux ou les 
« produits complexes ». Enfin, dans ses contrôles, l’ACPR a mis l’accent sur les conseils 
fournis sur les contrats d’assurance santé, la déliaison entre le crédit immobilier et 
l’assurance emprunteur, ainsi que sur le respect des obligations relatives aux contrats 
d’assurance-vie en déshérence. Sur ce sujet de la « loi Eckert », les assureurs suivis par 
l’ACPR ont ainsi réglé 2 milliards € aux bénéficiaires de contrats en déshérence en 2015 ; 
les banques ont de leur côté transféré 5,5 millions de comptes bancaires inactifs à la Caisse 
des dépôts et consignations en 2016, ce qui représente un montant total de 1,9 milliard € 
que les titulaires ou leurs ayant-droits peuvent récupérer. 
Quatrième enjeu : la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent et le financement du 
terrorisme, qui a été en 2016 une priorité accentuée d’action. Nous avons ainsi mené  
30 missions auprès des banques et assurances sur ce sujet en 2016, contre 22 en 2015. 
Ces missions complètent l’action de fond du contrôle permanent, qui a débouché l’année 
dernière sur près de 700 courriers de suivi. Au total, nous avons engagé et publié six 
sanctions disciplinaires à l’encontre d’établissements. L’année 2016 a donc été active en la 
matière, portant à 22 le nombre de sanctions prises depuis 2010 pour non-respect de la 
réglementation.

1 Recommandations sur le recueil des informations relatives à la connaissance du client, sur l’usage des médias sociaux, sur le 
traitement des réclamations, sur la publicité des comptes sur livret et sur les « produits complexes ».  
5 
 
En conclusion, c’est avec fierté que je regarde ce qui a été réalisé en 2016, mais sans 
relâchement ou complaisance : beaucoup de chantiers nous attendent en 2017, tant au 
niveau national qu’international. Une ACPR forte doit disposer des moyens nécessaires à 
l’accomplissement de ses missions : je souligne cet impératif. Je cède maintenant la parole à 
Bernard Delas, qui va vous présenter l’actualité prudentielle du secteur de l’assurance. Rémi 
Bouchez exposera ensuite l’activité de la Commission des sanctions. Je vous remercie de 
votre attention.

 Conférence annuelle Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa 
Forum économique de Bruxelles  - 1
er 
juin 2017 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France  
L’avenir de la zone euro :  
de la « trinité impossible » au « triangle de croissance »
i
  
 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être ici à Bruxelles et de m’exprimer devant un auditoire d’une telle qualité. 
Pour la génération des artisans européens qui est la mienne - j’étais à Maastricht il y a 
25 ans - Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa est une figure presque mythique de ces grands Italiens 
qui menèrent aussi cette « quête kantienne de l’unité européenne »
ii
. C’est donc un honneur 
pour moi de donner une conférence qui porte son nom. Il aurait certainement été très 
heureux du fait que la majorité des Français aient clairement exprimé leur attachement à 
l’euro à l’occasion de l’élection présidentielle française. Donner un nouvel élan au projet 
européen est en effet l’une des priorités du nouveau Président français. Et même si j’ai été 
invité il y a déjà plusieurs mois et si la Banque de France est totalement indépendante du 
gouvernement, j’aime à penser que ma présence ici ce matin est le signe d’un regain 
d’intérêt pour la voix de la France en Europe.   
L’Europe se trouve une fois de plus à la croisée des chemins. La crise financière mondiale 
de 2007-2008 et la crise de la dette souveraine de 2011 dans la zone euro ont laissé derrière 
elles un manque de croissance, un chômage élevé et des dettes publiques énormes. En 
outre, la sécurité de l’Europe a été directement affectée par le fléau du terrorisme qui vise 
nos citoyens et nos valeurs et, par ailleurs, nous n’avons pas encore trouvé de solutions 
durables à la crise des réfugiés.  
Et pourtant, en dépit de tous ces défis, le soutien à l’euro et à l’Union européenne demeure 
fort : d’après l’enquête Eurobaromètre, 72 % des citoyens de la zone euro se déclarent en 
2 
 
faveur de l’euro, soit le niveau le plus élevé depuis 2004
iii
, et plus de la moitié des citoyens 
de l’UE se disent attachés à l’Union européenne
iv
. Les signes les plus clairs de ce soutien 
constant au projet européen - malgré le Brexit, au-delà du Brexit - sont les récentes défaites 
électorales des partis nationalistes et de leur euroscepticisme dans plusieurs pays 
européens. Chaque fois que survient la tentation d’un retour au nationalisme, nous devrions 
nous souvenir des pères fondateurs de l’Union européenne - parmi lesquels Robert 
Schuman, Konrad Adenauer et Alcide de Gasperi. Ils partageaient la même devise : « plus 
jamais de guerre entre nous ». Dans le monde très incertain de 2017, et avec les flottements 
dangereux de la nouvelle Administration américaine, ceci est malheureusement toujours 
d’actualité : la paix reste la première promesse de l’Europe.  
C’est la raison pour laquelle notre responsabilité commune est de poursuivre sur la voie de 
l’intégration européenne. Mais nous ne pouvons pas continuer comme avant. Les citoyens 
attendent des résultats concrets. Nous n’avons pas nécessairement besoin de plus 
d’Europe, mais plutôt d’une « meilleure » Europe : moins de paroles, plus d’action. L’Europe 
doit se concentrer davantage sur un petit nombre de projets et être plus efficace. En bref : 
« faisons peu, mais bien, et jusqu’au bout ». Il y a naturellement des domaines prioritaires 
non économiques tels que la défense, la sécurité des frontières, le changement climatique 
ainsi que l’éducation et la formation des jeunes – par exemple un programme Erasmus Pro 
pour l’apprentissage destiné à la jeunesse sans qualification ni emploi. Mais je mettrai 
l’accent aujourd’hui sur le domaine économique qui est, de toute évidence, mon domaine 
d’expertise en tant que banquier central. Qui plus est, il existe une relation forte entre la 
prospérité économique et l’attachement des citoyens à l’Europe. Les orientations que je 
propose aujourd’hui précisent et développent certaines idées que j’ai présentées ici même il 
y a un peu plus d’un an. Je suis très heureux que le document de réflexion de la Commission 
européenne sur l’avenir de la zone euro, publié hier, aille dans la même direction, malgré 
une certaine prudence compréhensible... À mes yeux, c’est un signe supplémentaire qu’il y a 
aujourd’hui en Europe une dynamique unique, que nous ne devons pas laisser s’essouffler.   
J’aimerais insister aujourd’hui sur ce que je vois comme trois triangles économiques. Tout 
d’abord, nous avons résolu un premier triangle d’incompatibilité il y a 18 ans en réalisant 
notre union monétaire. À présent, nous sommes confrontés à un deuxième triangle 
d’incompatibilité, en raison des faiblesses de notre union économique. Par conséquent, je 
pense que nous devons désormais mettre en œuvre un triangle de compatibilité pour doper 
la croissance de l’Europe et relancer le projet européen.   
 
 
3 
 
1. L’Union monétaire européenne a constitué une réponse efficace au défi de la 
« trinité impossible » 
Le premier triangle sur lequel je souhaiterais m’attarder est le fameux triangle 
d’incompatibilité tiré du modèle Mundell-Fleming des années 1960, également appelé la 
« trinité impossible » ou le « trilemme ». Ce triangle a été utilisé pour faire valoir qu’il est 
impossible de concilier la fixité des taux de change, la mobilité totale des capitaux et 
l’autonomie de la politique monétaire nationale.  
La « trinité impossible » :  
 
 
Dès 1982, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa a forgé le terme de « quatuor inconciliable »
v
 
(quartetto inconciliabile), ajoutant ainsi à la trinité impossible un quatrième objectif, le libre-
échange - un des piliers du Traité de Rome.  
Le « quatuor inconciliable » : 
 
Permettez-moi de citer ici une analyse éclairante de la Banque d’Italie
vi
 : « À première vue, 
cela peut sembler un choix surprenant, dans la mesure où du point de vue strictement 
4 
 
analytique, l’incompatibilité entre les trois autres éléments persiste, qu’il y ait libre-échange 
ou pas. Mais dans un sens économique plus profond, il était primordial de prendre en 
considération les échanges commerciaux, dans la mesure où les coûts et avantages des 
différentes positions dans cet arbitrage triangulaire dépendent de façon déterminante du 
degré d’intégration commerciale ». Et comme l’écrivait Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa en 1988 : 
« À long terme, la seule solution  à l’incompatibilité est de compléter le marché intérieur par 
une union monétaire. [Sinon], il serait irréaliste d’attendre de la Communauté qu’elle soit 
capable de réaliser la quadrature du cercle. »
vii
. Le début des années 1990 a été en effet une 
période difficile pour le système monétaire européen : plusieurs pays ont été obligés de 
réaligner leur taux de change ou de sortir du système, comme par exemple l’Italie ou 
l’Espagne en 1992. C’est cette même année que l’Europe a choisi, avec le Traité de 
Maastricht, de progresser vers une union monétaire européenne.  
Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa avait raison de croire à la création de l’euro et de la 
recommander. L’euro a été un grand succès, qui a apporté des bénéfices concrets. 
Premièrement, la stabilité des prix, qui est le principal objectif assigné à l’Eurosystème et qui 
bénéficie directement au pouvoir d’achat des citoyens de la zone euro. Durant les dix-huit 
années écoulées depuis l’introduction de l’euro (1999-2016), l’inflation s’est établie à 1,7 % 
en moyenne, contre 4,6 % au cours des dix-huit années qui avaient précédé son introduction 
(1981-1998). Deuxièmement, les taux d’intérêt plus bas, qui sont le corollaire de la confiance 
que les investisseurs placent dans notre monnaie et qui peut être mesurée par la baisse des 
écarts (spreads) de taux d’intérêt à long terme vis-à-vis de l’Allemagne, qui s’établit entre -
 1,5 % pour la France et - 3,7 % pour l’Italie. Troisièmement, la stabilité interne du taux de 
change et un rôle international accru. Aujourd’hui, l’euro représente 20 % des réserves 
internationales, au deuxième rang derrière le dollar. Et avoir une monnaie reconnue au plan 
international procure des gains économiques : les marchés financiers sont plus attractifs 
pour les investisseurs nationaux et étrangers, plus liquides, et donc plus efficients. Mais cela 
confère également un poids politique : quand Mario Draghi prend la parole dans le cadre du 
G20, le monde entier écoute ce que l’Europe a à dire ; c’est un succès quasiment sans 
équivalent.  
 
2. Cependant, malgré la réussite de l’union monétaire, l’économie européenne est à 
présent confrontée à un nouveau trilemme.  
Des faiblesses sont apparues. Pour répondre aux attentes de la population, il faut identifier 
les défauts de notre union en regardant la vérité en face. Sur la croissance, nous devons 
distinguer l’image présente du film complet que nous avons vécu. L’image présente est 
positive : la zone euro accélère sa croissance et va aujourd’hui aussi vite que les États-Unis 
5 
 
ou le Royaume-Uni. Mais ceci ne suffit pas à rattraper le retard des années passées : le film 
complet jusqu’à aujourd’hui montre une trajectoire cumulée de la croissance dans l’UE 
inférieure de 7,5 points de PIB à celle des États-Unis. Même mesurée par habitant, cette 
sous-performance s’établit à 5 points de pourcentage. Et l’on observe le même contraste en 
ce qui concerne la convergence entre pays. L’image présente, positive, est celle de 
divergences intra-zone fortement réduites, et à leur plus bas niveau depuis 1999. Mais le film 
complet jusqu’à aujourd’hui est celui d’écarts de revenu par tête qui se sont plutôt creusés, 
du fait des crises de 2009-2012.  
Qui plus est, les États membres ont trop souvent tendance à agir isolément, sans tenir 
compte des externalités et de l’impact de leurs politiques sur les autres. Cela aboutit à une 
situation collective sous-optimale : d’après une étude des services de la Banque de 
France
viii
, le coût d’opportunité lié à l’insuffisance de la coordination des politiques 
budgétaires à la suite de la crise serait compris entre 1 et 2 points de PIB dans la zone 
euro. En outre, le coût estimé des carences de coordination de nos politiques budgétaires 
et structurelles serait compris entre 2 et 3 points de PIB entre 2011 et 2013. Même si notre 
politique monétaire commune fonctionne bien, elle ne peut se substituer ni à la coordination 
des politiques économiques ni au manque de réformes. À Maastricht, notre objectif était de 
construire une Union économique et monétaire. Nous avons réussi l’Union monétaire, mais 
nous n’avons pas atteint nos objectifs s’agissant de l’Union économique.  
Dès lors, en résumé, un nouveau trilemme est apparu.  
Le trilemme actuel : 
 
Il semble actuellement impossible pour les pays de la zone euro de réaliser complètement 
leur potentiel de croissance – le premier sommet du triangle – s’ils souhaitent en même 
temps atteindre les deux autres objectifs : d’une part, maintenir l’autonomie des politiques 
économiques nationales, et d’autre part, laisser inchangé le « cadre de coordination de la 
zone euro » c’est-à-dire maintenir le statu quo, avec une coopération entre pays reposant 
6 
 
uniquement sur des règles sans institutions et sans stratégie commune. Nous devons 
renoncer à l’un des sommets de ce triangle pour réaliser les deux autres. Il me semble que 
la solution évidente pour les pays de la zone euro est de refuser le statu quo et de modifier le 
« cadre de coordination de la zone euro » dans le sens d’un renforcement de la coopération. 
Je vais maintenant vous détailler les grandes lignes de ce que je considère comme la voie à 
suivre.  
 
 
3. Pour stimuler la croissance européenne, ce nouveau trilemme doit être transformé 
en « triangle de croissance ».  
Nous devons faire encore avancer l’Union économique, grâce à ce que j’appelle le « triangle 
de croissance ». Sa particularité est qu’il ne s’agit pas d’un triangle d’incompatibilité mais 
d’un triangle de compatibilité. Cela signifie que les trois objectifs peuvent et doivent être 
poursuivis simultanément pour procurer des gains économiques. Ces objectifs, ou leviers, 
sont : les réformes structurelles nationales ; l’Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation ; et un dosage des politiques économiques dans la zone euro (policy-mix) 
reposant sur une meilleure coordination macroéconomique. Ils peuvent être mis en oeuvre 
rapidement, d’autant que nombre d’entre eux ne nécessitent pas de modifier les Traités.  
Le « triangle de croissance » : 
 
En tant que banquier central et européen convaincu, c’est ce que je crois nécessaire pour 
une « meilleure Europe ». Mais évidemment, la décision ne nous appartient pas et revient 
aux dirigeants politiques. Notre responsabilité, en tant qu’’Eurosystème, est de mener une 
politique monétaire conforme au mandat qui nous a été confié et de faire des propositions 
pour améliorer l’efficience des autres politiques économiques. 
7 
 
 
Le premier sommet de mon triangle de croissance est constitué par les réformes 
structurelles nationales. Elles sont une condition préalable pour que chaque pays retrouve 
sa crédibilité en Europe et pour libérer notre potentiel collectif de croissance économique. 
Leur intensité serait naturellement variable d’un pays à l’autre. La France et l’Italie, par 
exemple, affichent un retard qu’elles doivent rattraper, tandis que d’autres pays, notamment 
l’Allemagne, l’Espagne et les Pays-Bas, ont réussi à mener des réformes de grande ampleur 
et en tirent aujourd’hui les bénéfices en termes de croissance du PIB et d’emploi.  
 
Je voudrais souligner que ces exemples montrent que la réussite économique est totalement 
compatible avec le modèle social européen que nous partageons, qui combine des normes 
élevées de service public et des niveaux d’inégalités plus faibles  – beaucoup plus faibles, 
par exemple, que dans la société américaine. Et nous pouvons clairement escompter 
aujourd’hui une accélération des réformes en France : c’est une bonne chose non seulement 
pour mon pays, mais aussi pour l’Europe dans son ensemble.  
 
La réussite des réformes nationales serait amplifiée par leur combinaison avec deux 
réformes européennes – les deux autres sommets de mon triangle. La première réforme 
est microéconomique : la création d’une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation (UFII). La nécessité d’une telle Union de financement 
découle à la fois d’une faiblesse, la fragmentation financière persistante dans la zone euro, 
et d’une opportunité, l’excédent d’épargne par rapport à l’investissement dans la zone euro, 
à hauteur de 350 milliards d’euros par an. Une façon évidente de stimuler la croissance est 
donc de mieux orienter notre épargne abondante vers le financement de l’investissement et 
de l’innovation par-delà les frontières. Et cela suppose d’offrir aux entreprises davantage de 
8 
 
solutions de financement par fonds propres. L’Europe est très en retard en ce domaine : ce 
type de financement ne représente que 68 % du PIB dans la zone euro, contre 128 % aux 
États-Unis au quatrième trimestre 2016. La création de l’Union de financement amplifierait 
l’incidence des réformes nationales : tandis que les réformes encourageraient la volonté 
d’investir  des entreprises, l’Union de financement renforcerait leur capacité à investir, et 
ensemble, elles soutiendraient la dynamique microéconomique et la compétitivité.  
Les efforts accomplis jusqu’à présent vont dans la bonne direction, mais les travaux doivent 
maintenant s’accélérer. Les fondations existent déjà : le plan d’investissement Juncker ; 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux, qui favorise la diversification du financement privé ; et 
l’Union bancaire, qui remédie au problème de la fragmentation. Ces initiatives doivent être 
rassemblées au sein de l’Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation afin de 
transcender les frontières administratives ou bureaucratiques, de créer des synergies et par 
conséquent de donner un nouvel élan à ce projet. Pourquoi pas un véritable capital-risque 
européen, par exemple ? 
Plus concrètement, les progrès vers une Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation nécessitent de préciser les propositions dans quatre domaines clés : 
- en premier lieu, l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire. Cela  implique, en priorité, de 
finaliser le second pilier de l’Union bancaire, c’est-à-dire la résolution unique. Dans le 
cadre d’une Union bancaire robuste, les banques de la zone euro seront ainsi en mesure 
de s’engager dans des consolidations transfrontières sur une base saine et solide et 
contribueront donc à réduire encore la fragmentation financière. Cela passe également 
par l’harmonisation des régimes de faillite des entreprises. 
- deuxième domaine clé : la révision en profondeur des dispositifs d’incitation aux 
investissements transfrontières, notamment par une plus grande convergence des 
régimes fiscaux et réglementaires.  
- troisième domaine : l’accroissement de l’offre de services d’intermédiation financière, 
que ce soit sous forme de nouveaux produits d’épargne (à plus long terme et plus 
orientés vers le risque) ou de nouvelles initiatives de marché en matière d’obligations 
vertes ou de placements privés, par exemple.  
- quatrième domaine : s’assurer que les activités financières et les risques vitaux pour les 
économies européennes sont correctement contrôlés, ce qui nécessite en particulier de 
relocaliser certaines activités dans l’Union européenne, comme les activités de 
compensation libellées en euros qui sont d’importance systémique pour la zone euro.  
 
9 
 
La seconde réforme au niveau européen est une ambition macroéconomique : un 
meilleur dosage des politiques économiques (policy-mix) de la zone euro, qui 
permettrait de compenser les désagréments à court terme liés aux réformes structurelles 
nationales, dans l’attente des bénéfices à long terme. Je veux être très clair : nous ne 
devons pas abandonner les règles existantes qui s’appliquent à chaque État membre, 
notamment le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance : les règles sont nécessaires, mais elles ne 
sont pas suffisantes. Ce qui nous manque à l’heure actuelle, c’est une direction commune, 
malgré les progrès apportés par la méthode du Semestre européen. Un bon dosage des 
politiques économiques de la zone euro nécessite une stratégie économique collective, par 
laquelle les États membres scellent un accord impliquant chaque pays. Il s’agit de viser, d’ici 
à fin 2017, des progrès évidents : la croissance et l’emploi seront plus forts en Europe si 
nous combinons davantage de réformes structurelles là où elles sont nécessaires – 
comme en France et en Italie – et davantage de soutien budgétaire ou salarial dans les 
pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre en la matière – comme l’Allemagne et les Pays-
Bas.  
Une autre mesure relativement facile à prendre serait la création d’un fonds commun de 
stabilisation représentant 1 à 2 % du PIB de la zone euro, qui nous fournirait une capacité 
de stabilisation macroéconomique. Je note que ceci converge largement avec la proposition 
de la Commission de créer un mécanisme de stabilisation macroéconomique pour la zone 
euro. Ce fonds commun de stabilisation serait utilisé, en respectant des règles efficientes – 
mais sans être subordonné à un programme d’ajustement, contrairement au MES –, pour 
réduire les déséquilibres macroéconomiques de la zone euro, en soutenant, par des prêts, 
les politiques contracycliques des États membres lorsqu’ils sont confrontés à des chocs 
économiques asymétriques. Le fonds serait lui-même financé par emprunt. 
Pour concrétiser à coup sûr cette ambition, la zone euro aura besoin d’une pierre angulaire 
commune : une institution qui favorise la confiance. En effet, comme Tommaso 
Padoa-Schioppa l’a formulé : « la réalisation d’une cohérence complète et systématique des 
politiques [nationales] sans infrastructure institutionnelle est une utopie »
ix
. C’est la raison 
pour laquelle le nouveau Président français a proposé la création d’un « ministre des 
Finances » de la zone euro, ce qui nécessite probablement de modifier les Traités existants. 
Ce ministre des Finances incarnerait et réaliserait l’engagement partagé de nos États 
membres. Comme j’ai également évoqué cette idée précédemment
x
, j’aimerais vous faire 
part de quelques idées personnelles sur le sujet. En respectant totalement le principe de 
subsidiarité, ce ministre des Finances devrait être : premièrement, fort sur le plan 
institutionnel, en étant à la fois le Commissaire européen à l’Économie et le Président de 
l’Eurogroupe ; deuxièmement, légitime sur le plan démocratique, en étant responsable 
10 
 
devant le Parlement européen en formation adéquate ; troisièmement, appuyé sur le plan 
technique par un Trésor européen – reposant largement sur l’expertise des services de la 
Commission européenne – et par un Conseil de politique économique consultatif et 
indépendant, et coordonnant le Mécanisme européen de stabilité et la gestion de crise ; et 
enfin, reconnu sur le plan international comme le porte-parole économique de la zone 
euro, aux côtés du Président de la BCE sur le volet monétaire.  
À plus long terme, à mesure que la confiance mutuelle entre les pays de la zone euro 
augmentera, il conviendra d’envisager une dernière étape pour réaliser notre capacité 
commune d’investissement : un véritable budget de la zone euro, géré par le ministre des 
Finances. Ce serait un outil puissant. Toutefois, ce budget de la zone euro ne doit en aucun 
cas être confondu avec une « union de transfert » à sens unique, et je comprends à cet 
égard les craintes allemandes. Il devrait potentiellement profiter à tous les pays de la zone 
euro, et pas seulement aux plus faibles, et trouverait son ancrage dans une convergence 
économique accrue. Il pourrait également servir à financer certains « biens publics 
européens » tels que la technologie numérique, la transition énergétique ou l’intégration des 
réfugiés. Il pourrait également comporter un système d’assurance-chômage à l’échelle de 
l’Europe. Et pour être efficace, il devrait pouvoir émettre directement une dette commune 
(pour l’avenir) et/ou collecter des impôts. Il s’agirait évidemment d’un « saut quantique » 
dans la nature de notre Union, qui exigerait une volonté politique résolue, mais c’est notre 
chance de faire vraiment changer les choses.  
 
*** 
Mesdames et Messieurs, je voudrais conclure en citant un citoyen britannique, qui a été un 
des plus grands Européens du siècle passé. Winston Churchill a dit en août 1949
xi
 : « Je suis 
certain qu’il est en notre pouvoir de surmonter les dangers qui nous guettent, si nous le 
voulons. Nos espérances et notre travail annoncent une ère de paix, de prospérité et 
d’abondance, et la richesse et le génie inépuisables de l’Europe la transformeront une fois 
de plus en source même et inspiration de la vie du monde. » L’Union européenne reste à ce 
jour une expérience politique et économique unique, sans équivalent dans l’histoire 
moderne. Et, dans le sillage du cycle électoral en Europe, l’année 2017 nous offre une 
fenêtre unique d’opportunités. Rien ne doit être tenu pour acquis, mais beaucoup est ouvert. 
Nous ne devons pas laisser échapper cette opportunité. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

6 16 juin 2017 
Une matinée en trois temps 
<U+F0D8> Depuis le 4 novembre 2014, les compétences de 
l’ACPR s’exercent dans le cadre du MSU ou 
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), le premier 
pilier de l’Union bancaire européenne qui confie à 
la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) la 
supervision de l’ensemble des banques de la zone 
euro, en lien avec les autorités nationales 
compétentes (ANC). Cette supervision unique est 
exercée de deux façons :  
<U+F0A7> une supervision directe de la BCE pour les 
établissements considérés comme 
« importants » en collaboration avec les ANC ;  
<U+F0A7> une supervision par les autorités nationales pour 
les « institutions moins importantes », sous le 
contrôle et dans le cadre défini par la BCE.

tests de résistance (« stress-tests ») prudentiels 
<U+F071> Différents exercices de stress-tests réalisés par les banques, dits    
« bottom-up », ont ainsi été effectués par le passé : cf. dernier 
exercice EBA 2016 – et l’exercice à venir EBA 2018 
 
<U+F071> Stress tests réalisés par les superviseurs, dits « top-down » avec 
des scénarios macroéconomiques, destinés à analyser la

<U+F071> Simulation de l’impact de 3 scénarios de 
baisse des prix immobiliers sur les 
portefeuilles d’expositions à l’immobilier

CRE français (hors bureaux franciliens) 
et -30 % pour les bureaux en Île de 
France 
<U+F0A7> Scénario 2 : -30 % sur les bureaux en 
Île de France 
<U+F0A7> Scénario 3 : -60 % sur les bureaux en

<U+F071> L’impact du stress-test sur la solvabilité 
des établissements serait dans l’ensemble

Le risque de taux dans le portefeuille bancaire : analyse en 
sensibilité ou stress tests IRRBB (en cours par le MSU) 
OBJECTIFS :  
 
1. Examiner l’impact de différents scénarios 
d’évolutions des taux sur les 2 métriques de 
mesure de l’IRRBB prévues par les guidelines EBA 
et le standard du Comité de Bâle :  
<U+F0D8> la valeur économique du banking book 
(Economic Value of Equity, EVE)  
<U+F0D8> les projections du revenu net d’intérêt           
(Net Interest Income, NII) 
 
2. Approfondir l’analyse en étudiant la sensibilité 
de l’EVE et du NII à deux facteurs : 
<U+F0D8> Aux hypothèses de calibration des 
modèles ALM utilisés par les banques  
<U+F0D8> Aux produits dérivés du portefeuille 
bancaire

Rubric 
www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu ©  
1. Notre ambition 
 Quels sont nos principes en matière de supervision bancaire? 
• Une supervision proactive faisant une large place au jugement, ce qui 
implique : 
• Une connaissance approfondie des risques et des activités des banques, 
• La prise en compte des liens entre les banques et le reste du système financier,  
• Un accent mis sur la gouvernance, la culture de risque et l’appétit au risque, 
• Des interactions régulières avec les conseils et les directions des établissements. 
• Des approches multiples sur les risques, grâce à la fluidité de 
l’information, ce qui signifie : 
• Promouvoir une perspective interinstitutionnelle, 
• Viser les meilleures pratiques de supervision, en se comparant à l’état de l’art, 
• Éviter de se reposer sur un modèle ou sur une méthodologie uniques. 
• Une collaboration de qualité entre la BCE et les Autorités Nationales 
Compétentes (ANCs) 
• C’est la base de la construction du MSU. 
• L’ expertise de la BCE est renforcée par le socle de connaissances communes des ANCs. 
37 
Rubric 
www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu ©  
1. Notre ambition 
 
 
Comment ces principes sont-ils mis en œuvre dans le MSU? 
38 
• Des analyses à la fois qualitatives et quantitatives, portant sur: 
• Le niveau des risques et la qualité du contrôle des risques, 
• Une double évaluation, à la fois prospective et s'appuyant sur le passé ( par ex: résultats 
de stress-tests et PD, LGD pour les modèles). 
• Un jugement « encadré » comme point d’ancrage 
• Pour garantir une égalité de traitement entre les banques. 
• Une approche fondée sur le risque, … 
• Se focalisant sur les risques les plus importants, 
• Analysant finement les sécurités mises en place et les mécanismes de contrôle interne, 
• S’appuyant sur des contrôles sur pièces et sur place approfondis. 
• … et respectant le principe de proportionnalité : 
• Le niveau de contrôle reflète l’impact systémique et la complexité des risques encourus, 
• Les ressources de surveillance sont concentrées sur les éléments les mieux à même de  
renforcer la stabilité financière, 
• Des “niveaux d’engagement” minimaux sont définis afin d’assurer la qualité et la 
cohérence de la supervision.

Prêts non performants  
(2015 - 2016), Mrd. Euro 
Prêts non performants
• Des lignes directrices concernant les prêts non performants ont été 
publiées en mars 2017 par la BCE 
• Elles détaillent les mesures, les processus et les bonnes pratiques en matière de  
traitement des prêts non performants; et 
• Elles « invitent » les banques à mettre en œuvre des stratégies ambitieuses, mais 
réalistes de réduction des prêts non performants. 
• L’évaluation complète réalisée en 2014 a 
permis d’identifier ces créances 
douteuses dans la zone euro et d’en 
améliorer le provisionnement; mais cela 
ne suffit pas! 
• Les prêts non performants constituent 
un fardeau dans le bilan des banques 
• réduisant la profitabilité des banques, 
• contraignant leur capacité à octroyer des 
crédits à l’économie.

• Elle favorise la quête de rendement par la prise de risques, et 
• Justifie un suivi particulier des opérations à effet de levier. 
• La « revue thématique » consacrée à l’activité des banques en matière de 
financement à effet de levier a révélé : 
• Un intérêt accru des banques pour ce type d’investissement, et 
• D’importantes différences dans les méthodes utilisées pour définir, mesurer, et 
surveiller les transactions à effet de levier. 
• Le BCE a donc décidé de définir des lignes directrices sur les opérations 
à effet de levier (publiées le 16 mai 2017) 
• Ces lignes directrices visent à élaborer des définitions claires et uniformes, à 
permettre un suivi cohérent et à définir les mesures appropriées en ce qui concerne 
les opérations à effet de levier.

L’exigence d’exécution rapide et sans faille des programmes mis en 
place et des actions décidées : par exemple le contrôle sur place 
 
• Pour une autorité de supervision aussi large et  aussi décentralisée, au 
sein de laquelle on travaille dans 16 langues, cela n’a rien de trivial 
• Les 200 contrôles sur place (hors modèles internes) qui sont réalisés en 
moyenne par an :  
• Sont effectués par des équipes mixtes et exigent une coopération renforcée entre les 
responsables des équipes d'inspection à la BCE et dans les ANCs; 
• Requièrent une application uniforme des méthodes, une transparence suffisante vis-à-
vis des banques quant aux résultats, et une grand cohérence des lettres de suite qui 
sont envoyées. 
• D’où la mise en place récente d’un cadre  renforcé, qui permet de tirer 
tous les bénéfices du contrôle sur place; il s’appuie sur: 
• Une meilleure planification des contrôles sur place et du recrutement du personnel 
nécessaire en étroite coopération avec les ANCs. 
• Un niveau d’engagement plus ciblé et fondé sur les risques. 
• Un contrôle de cohérence et de qualité plus approfondi.

Convention FESE - « L’avenir de l’Europe                   
sur les marchés mondiaux de capitaux » 
Paris, jeudi 22 juin 2017 
 
Remarques conclusives de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
gouverneur de la Banque de France  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Clémence Choutet (01 42 97 74 51 ; clemence.choutet@banque-france.fr). 
 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir pour moi d’être avec vous aujourd’hui pour conclure cette 
convention FESE. Lorsque nous réfléchissons à l’avenir de l’Europe sur les 
marchés mondiaux de capitaux, nous convenons tous que le vote en faveur du 
Brexit, l’année dernière, a considérablement modifié le paysage européen. Un 
an après, c’est encore une mauvaise nouvelle pour nous tous, mais c’est bien 
pire pour le Royaume-Uni lui-même, et chaque jour davantage. Quoi qu’il en 
soit, face au Brexit, nous devons au moins être cohérents. Et l’UE à 27 l’est, 
cohérente, comme on le voit avec M. Macron et Mme Merkel : nous 
souhaitons conclure les négociations de façon positive, mais il ne peut pas y 
avoir de marché unique à la carte, ni d’accès sans des règles communes. Par 
ailleurs, j’aimerais insister sur deux impératifs : premièrement, nous ne devons 
pas laisser de sources de risque systémique pour l’UE se développer en 
dehors de l’UE ; deuxièmement, nous devons accélérer la création d’une 
« Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » afin de stimuler 
l’investissement productif grâce à une meilleure circulation de l’épargne 
par-delà les frontières. Permettez-moi d’aborder plus en détails ces deux 
impératifs. 
** 
1. Ne laissons pas des sources de risque systémique pour l’UE se 
développer en dehors de l’UE 
Je commencerai par le premier impératif. Le principal problème à cet égard 
est que certaines infrastructures des marchés financiers, qui sont essentielles 
pour l’UE, deviendront bientôt extérieures à l’UE en raison du Brexit. C’est 
particulièrement problématique lorsque ces infrastructures risquent de mettre 
en danger  la stabilité financière de l’UE : certaines contreparties centrales, 
par exemple, peuvent être considérées comme étant des entités trop grandes 
pour faire faillite (too-big-to-fail), notamment du fait du caractère obligatoire de 
la compensation. Par rapport aux autres devises, il s’agit d’une préoccupation 
 
 
spécifique à l’euro puisque la gestion de l’épargne européenne est presque 
totalement dépendante d’acteurs financiers et d’infrastructures de marché 
basés à Londres. Et pourtant, nous ne pouvons pas raisonnablement attendre 
de ces infrastructures mondiales qu’elles tiennent compte, dans leurs 
opérations et leur gestion des risques, de la stabilité financière de la zone 
euro, en plus de la stabilité financière de leur propre juridiction.   
Par conséquent, comme Londres sera malheureusement bientôt en dehors de 
l’UE, l’organisation actuelle n’est plus adaptée. Il n’est pas possible de 
reproduire, pour l’activité de compensation en euros, l’approche 
extraterritoriale développée par les autorités américaines, en raison de la 
position spécifique du marché des capitaux de l’UE vis-à-vis de Londres et 
aussi parce que nous savons d’expérience qu’en période de crise, les avis des 
autorités nationales de régulation sont prépondérants en cas de divergence 
d’intérêt.   
Alors que devons-nous faire ? À mon avis, une politique de localisation 
représente l’outil le plus efficace : d’abord, afin d’exercer un contrôle effectif 
sur les activités libellées dans les devises de l’UE ; et ensuite, pour favoriser 
une meilleure structure de marché, plus équilibrée, moins dépendante des 
entités trop grandes pour faire faillite, qui améliorerait la stabilité financière 
mondiale – et pas seulement celle de l’UE. À cet égard, je veux saluer les 
propositions très récentes de la Commission européenne, qui vont dans le bon 
sens, même si elles pourraient être renforcées et rationalisées : les 
contreparties centrales dont les activités sont « super-systémiques » pour le 
marché de l’UE doivent effectivement s’établir au sein de l’Union européenne. 
Cette politique de localisation constitue le seul mécanisme viable pour assurer 
aux autorités européennes, et à l’Eurosystème en particulier, le contrôle et la 
maîtrise des risques que les contreparties centrales sont susceptibles de faire 
peser sur la stabilité financière de l’Union européenne. À cette fin, le concept 
de CCP d’importance systémique substantielle (substantially systemically 
important CCP) devrait toutefois être défini précisément, avec des exigences 
objectives, fondées sur des règles claires ; les activités de compensation 
 
 
libellées en euros devraient être localisées dans l’Union européenne 
lorsqu’elles dépassent certains seuils. 
 
2. Accélérons la création d’une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation »  
Le second impératif consiste à accélérer la création d’une « Union de 
financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » au niveau européen. La 
nécessité de cette Union de financement découle à la fois d’une faiblesse et 
d’une opportunité. La faiblesse, c’est que la zone euro est confrontée à une 
fragmentation financière persistante. Mais l’opportunité réside dans 
l’abondance de ses ressources : l’excès d’épargne par rapport à 
l’investissement représente 350 milliards d’euros par an dans la zone euro, 
soit plus de 3 % du PIB. Une façon évidente de stimuler la croissance au sein 
de l’UE est donc de mieux orienter notre épargne abondante vers le 
financement de l’investissement et de l’innovation par-delà les frontières. De 
cette façon, nous serons en mesure de remédier à la « pénurie 
d’investissement » persistante qui a suivi la crise financière (le ratio 
investissement/PIB reste inférieur à son niveau du début du 21
e 
siècle : 20 % 
en 2016 contre 22 % sur la période 2000-2005.  
La réussite de cette Union de financement réside dans la capacité à offrir aux 
entreprises davantage de solutions de financement par fonds propres, 
permettant ainsi aux PME de se développer. L’Europe est très en retard dans 
ce domaine : ce type de financement ne représente que 68 % du PIB dans la 
zone euro, contre 128 % aux États-Unis au quatrième trimestre 2016. Bien 
sûr, les éléments constitutifs de cette Union de financement existent déjà avec 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux, qui favorise la diversification du financement 
privé ; le plan d’investissement Juncker, qui oriente l’investissement public et 
privé vers l’économie réelle ; et l’Union bancaire, qui traite le problème de la 
fragmentation. Ces initiatives doivent cependant être rassemblées au sein de 
l’Union de financement afin de transcender les frontières administratives ou 
 
 
bureaucratiques, de créer des synergies et par conséquent de donner un 
nouvel élan à ce projet. Imaginons par exemple un véritable marché européen 
du capital-risque destiné à promouvoir le financement par fonds propres, qui 
représente le mode de financement le plus efficace des entreprises innovantes 
quel que soit leur stade de développement (amorçage, démarrage ou 
expansion). 
Plus précisément, les progrès vers une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation sont nécessaires dans trois domaines clés :  
- premièrement : l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire. Cela implique, en 
priorité, de finaliser le second pilier de l’Union bancaire, c’est-à-dire le 
mécanisme de résolution unique. Dans le cadre d’une Union bancaire 
robuste, les banques de la zone euro seront ainsi en mesure de s’engager 
dans des consolidations transfrontières sur une base saine et solide et 
contribueront donc à réduire encore la fragmentation financière ; 
- deuxièmement : la révision en profondeur des dispositifs d’incitation aux 
investissements transfrontières, notamment en favorisant une plus grande 
convergence des régimes fiscaux et réglementaires. Le renforcement de la 
libre circulation des capitaux au sein de l’UE nécessite de surmonter un 
large éventail d’obstacles juridiques, en particulier en améliorant la 
prévisibilité des cadres de faillite, en éliminant les biais liés à la fiscalité qui 
pénalisent les fonds propres et en améliorant encore la transparence et 
l’harmonisation des règles comptables s’appliquant aux petites 
entreprises ; 
- troisièmement : l’accroissement de l’offre de services d’intermédiation 
financière, que ce soit sous forme de nouveaux produits d’épargne et de 
nouveaux véhicules d’investissement (à plus long terme et plus orientés 
vers le risque) à l’échelle européenne ou de nouvelles initiatives de marché 
en matière d’obligations vertes, de placements privés ou de titrisation, par 
exemple. Au nombre des mesures complémentaires pourrait figurer la 
création de fonds paneuropéens de capital-risque et la mise à profit du 
 
 
développement des FinTechs, tout en maintenant un niveau élevé de 
protection des consommateurs et de bonnes règles de conduite dans un 
environnement numérique. 
** 
Permettez-moi de conclure sur une remarque d’ordre général. Après le Brexit 
et l’élection de M. Trump, nombreux étaient ceux qui s’attendaient à une crise 
de la zone euro. Jusqu’à présent, il s’est produit exactement le contraire : la 
croissance européenne s’accélère et son rythme est proche de celui de la 
croissance américaine. Les élections en France ont donné un nouvel élan 
politique à la stabilité et aux réformes ; le soutien du public en faveur de 
l’Europe a nettement augmenté, de 18 points de pourcentage en France par 
rapport à l’année dernière (56 % au printemps 2017) selon une récente 
enquête de l’institut de recherche Pew Research Center ; et la même 
tendance peut être observée dans plusieurs pays. Surtout, dans une UE à 27, 
nous ne devons pas consacrer toute notre énergie au Brexit, au détriment de 
l’investissement dans notre propre avenir. À cet égard, c’est le bon moment 
pour passer à la vitesse supérieure. Pour stimuler la croissance européenne, 
les leviers financiers sont essentiels, mais les leviers économiques ont 
également un rôle à jouer. C’est la raison pour laquelle je parle souvent de 
« triangle de croissance » de l’Europe. À mon avis, l’Europe doit activer trois 
leviers : l’Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation que je 
viens juste de décrire, mais également la mise en œuvre de réformes 
structurelles nationales d’une part et un meilleur dosage des politiques 
économiques dans la zone euro (policy-mix) d’autre part. Les réformes 
structurelles nationales constituent, pour chaque pays, une condition préalable 
si nous voulons libérer notre potentiel collectif de croissance. En outre, elles 
amplifieraient les effets de l’Union de financement : une Union de ce type 
renforcerait la capacité des entreprises à investir et les réformes nationales 
encourageraient les entreprises dans leur propension à investir. Le troisième 
levier repose sur un dosage des politiques économiques de la zone euro basé 
sur une meilleure coordination des politiques macroéconomiques. À cet effet, 
 
 
une stratégie économique collective impliquant un accord entre les États 
membres est indispensable : si nous combinons davantage de réformes 
structurelles là où elles sont nécessaires – comme en France et en Italie – et 
davantage de soutien budgétaire ou salarial dans les pays disposant d’une 
marge de manœuvre en la matière – comme l’Allemagne et les Pays-Bas, la 
croissance et l’emploi seront indéniablement plus forts partout en Europe. Si 
nous saisissons cette occasion, l’heure de l’Europe sera venue. Je vous 
remercie de votre attention.

Rencontres économiques d’Aix-en-Provence 2017 
Aix-en-Provence – 9 juillet 2017 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Je pars d'un étonnement linguistique. Dans notre débat français, le mot prospérité a vieilli :  
il évoque le XIX
e
 siècle et les rentiers ""au ventre rebondi, un cigare à la bouche"" (E.Orsenna). 
Dans le débat européen à l'inverse, le mot revient toujours : du préambule du traité de Rome au 
nouveau Président de la République qui, dès le lendemain de son intronisation, dit à Berlin  
""Sans l'Europe, nous n'aurions ni la paix, ni la liberté, ni la prospérité "". 
Qu'est-ce à dire, alors même que l'Europe apparaît souvent comme à la traîne dans la création de 
richesses ? Au passage, tordons le cou à un excès d'autoflagellation en la matière : si on regarde 
la progression du PIB / habitant en PPA depuis une grande génération (1980), les tigres asiatiques 
et la Chine ont évidemment fait mieux, mais beaucoup de pays d'Europe du Nord ont fait aussi 
bien que les États-Unis. Même notre ""pauvre France"", certes en retard, a doublé son revenu réel 
par tête depuis une génération : nous sommes souvent persuadés du contraire.  
M<U+200E>ais mon explication ce matin à l'étonnement  linguistique est autre : c'est que l'identité   
de l'Europe, sa vocation est précisément dans l'écart de concept entre la seule croissance – ou le 
revenu par habitant – et la prospérité. Cet écart, il en est une part intangible et personnelle,  
le bonheur, la ""vie bonne"" d'Aristote reprise par Edmund Phelps dans sa ""Prospérité de masse"". 
Mais il en est une face mesurable et collective : les inégalités, la solidarité, la ""croissance 
inclusive"" pour reprendre le nouveau mantra de nos réunions internationales. Et là, sur les 
instruments de la prospérité, l'Europe a une chose à dire, mais plus encore deux choses à faire.  
Ce que l'Europe (au sens continental) pourrait dire plus fort, c'est qu'elle partage un modèle social 
qui même la définit : des services publics forts y compris une éducation pour tous, plus une 
redistribution fiscale et sociale, plus un dialogue social actif. Et que ceci conduit à des inégalités 
encore nettement inférieures aux États<U+200E>-Unis : l'indice de Gini y est en France comme en 
Allemagne inférieur de plus de 20 %,<U+200E> et<U+200E> plus<U+200E> encore<U+200E> avec<U+200E> les<U+200E> pays<U+200E> émergents.<U+200E> La stabilité 
monétaire et la stabilité financière, que nous visons avec l'Eurosystème,  sont un socle 
indispensable de cette solidarité : on l'a vu malheureusement, les premières victimes de la crise 
financière sont d'abord les plus défavorisés, à travers notamment la montée du chômage.  
- 2 - 
Mais l'Europe a surtout deux choses à faire, car la complaisance n'est évidemment pas de mise.  
Si l'Europe veut conforter son modèle social, elle doit agir vers l'extérieur, et sur elle-même.   
Au niveau mondial, se multiplient les discours désolés sur la montée des inégalités  
- singulièrement dans le monde anglo-saxon doublement traumatisé par le Brexit puis M. Trump.  
Il serait temps de combattre résolument ces inégalités : pas par le protectionnisme qui partout 
pénalise les plus pauvres ; pas par une déréglementation financière qui préparerait les dégâts 
d'une prochaine crise ; mais par de meilleurs modèles sociaux à l'intérieur des pays, et par le 
respect de règles du jeu collectives entre les pays, avec des institutions multilatérales qui en soient 
le garant. Si les États-Unis sont fatigués – temporairement ? – d'y jouer un rôle central, l'Europe et 
quelques autres doivent reprendre le flambeau. Et les formes doivent bien sûr en évoluer : le G20, 
le Conseil de Stabilité Financière, demain peut-être la cyber-sécurité, sont la preuve que la 
gouvernance internationale peut encore être créative. Je me félicite à cet égard que le sommet de 
Hambourg ait confirmé hier l'engagement de l'ensemble des 20 pays sur des règles  financières 
internationales, dont un renforcement sur le shadow banking. 
L'autre défi est interne, et je vais l'illustrer par la France : notre modèle social ne durera que si 
nous le réformons, comme nos voisins européens l'ont réussi avant nous. Je viens d'envoyer la 
traditionnelle ""Lettre au Président de la République""<U+200E> : nous devons saisir ce ""moment favorable"" 
que connaissent la France et l'Europe, pour oser des réformes qui renforcent à la fois l'efficacité  
et la justice.  Une parenthèse d'actualité : nous sommes tous pour les baisses d'impôts. Mais ne 
résumons pas la réforme à l'attente de baisses d'impôts immédiates et non financées : il y aurait là 
un peu de paresse intellectuelle et beaucoup d'imprévoyance financière – nous avons déjà 
beaucoup payé pour voir ce genre de traites sur l'avenir. 
Je cite donc pour conclure trois directions qui concilient l'efficacité et la justice. D'abord  faire 
reculer le chômage, bien sûr : nous sommes aujourd'hui à un peu moins de 10 %, c'est beaucoup 
trop ; nous pouvons descendre à 7 %, si nous additionnons réforme du marché du travail ET 
l'éducation et la formation professionnelle. Je cite parmi les plus vieux ouvrages les ""Réflexions 
sur la prospérité"" en 1652 du grand ministre suédois Oxenstierna : ""La bonne éducation de la 
jeunesse est le garant le plus sûr de la prospérité "". Ensuite financer notre modèle social, plutôt 
que d'en transférer la charge à la génération suivante : et pour cela corriger cette anomalie 
française que sont nos 56 % du PIB de dépenses publiques, contre 46 % pour nos voisins ; c'est 
cette longue dérive qui conduit à nos près de 100 % de dette publique. Enfin, nous devons donner 
envie aux jeunes, en leur offrant toutes les opportunités de l'innovation, de la révolution digitale et 
de la création d'entreprise : et pour cela ouvrir encore certains marchés des biens et services,  
y<U+200E>casser<U+200E>les<U+200E>rentes.<U+200E><U+200E>Et si nous cassons des rentes au nom de la prospérité, nous aurons en plus 
réconcilié Erick Orsenna avec ce vieux mot français...

Conférence à la Banque nationale d’Autriche 
Vienne, 6 octobre 2017 
 
La politique monétaire de la zone euro dans le contexte de reprise 
économique

Gouverneur de la Banque de France

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je remercie la Banque nationale d’Autriche et mon ami le gouverneur Ewald 
Nowotny de m’avoir invité aujourd’hui. Il y a un peu plus d’un an, le Conseil 
des gouverneurs de la BCE tout entier célébrait ici même le 200
e
 anniversaire 
de l’Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB). Aujourd’hui, votre pays est à la 
veille d’élections nationales importantes. À travers l’histoire, Vienne reste un 
des cœurs de l’Europe, et l’Autriche un pays que nous aimons : je lui dois 
personnellement d’avoir mieux appris la langue allemande, il y a plus de 
quarante ans dans un long séjour à Graz en Styrie. Et l’économie autrichienne 
a de belles performances à l’intérieur de la zone euro : un taux de chômage 
faible, à 5,6 % seulement en août 2017, contre 9,1 % pour l’ensemble de la 
zone euro. Vous êtes la preuve, avec d’autres pays, que notre modèle social 
européen commun est compatible avec le succès économique.  
Aujourd’hui, vous m’avez invité à parler de la politique monétaire de la zone 
euro dans le contexte de reprise économique. La perspective d’une possible 
normalisation de notre politique monétaire suscite des attentes et parfois des 
appréhensions infondées. Pour être franc, cette normalisation très progressive 
a déjà débuté. Je commencerai par souligner les progrès que notre politique 
monétaire accommodante a déjà permis de réaliser, avant d’aborder les 
perspectives pour l’avenir et enfin le nécessaire achèvement des instruments 
non monétaires en Europe.    
 
** 
I. Les progrès que nous avons déjà réalisés 
La reprise économique dans la zone euro est là [slide]. Elle est solide et 
généralisée à travers les pays et secteurs. Les dernières prévisions de la 
BCE
ii
 le confirment : la croissance devrait s’établir à 2,2 % en zone euro 
en 2017, soit une révision à la hausse très forte, de 0,3 point, par rapport à 
Page 2 sur 9 
 
 
nos prévisions de juin (1,9 %). Cela signifie que pour la deuxième année 
consécutive, la croissance de la zone euro va être comparable à celle des 
États-Unis. Et, selon le chiffrage de l’Eurosystème, l’output gap sera revenu 
presque à zéro en fin d’année (– 0,6 %). 
La politique monétaire non conventionnelle que nous menons depuis 2014 
contribue à cette accélération de la croissance en zone euro, en suscitant des 
conditions de financement très favorables et en soutenant la demande 
intérieure. Cette accélération se traduit de façon très concrète par davantage 
d’emplois – plus de 6 millions créés en zone euro depuis début 2013 – et par 
un redressement de l’investissement. L’investissement des entreprises en 
particulier, décisif pour les capacités d’offre, est clairement reparti : + 4,7 % 
en 2015, + 6 % en 2016, + 4 % en prévision 2017 et 2018 [slide]. Ce regain 
d’investissement est favorisé notamment par la croissance des prêts au 
secteur privé, qui se poursuit, à 2,5 % en rythme annuel en août 2017 pour les 
entreprises et à 2,7 % pour les ménages, et ceci à des taux toujours très bas.  
Nous enregistrons également des évolutions favorables en matière d’inflation, 
qui remonte progressivement vers notre cible de 2 % à moyen terme [slide]. 
Après un pic au début de l’année 2017, l’inflation s’est établie en septembre à 
1,5 % en glissement annuel. Ce résultat demeure inférieur à notre cible 
d’inflation, reflétant en partie les conditions défavorables créées par 
l’appréciation passée du taux de change. Toutefois, sur l’ensemble de 
l’année 2017, l’inflation en zone euro, à 1,5 %, devrait être bien supérieure 
celle de l’année dernière. Pour les années à venir, nous prévoyons 1,2 % 
d’inflation en 2018 et 1,5 % en 2019 – avec un changement de composition : 
moins d’inflation « énergie », plus d’inflation sous-jacente. Ceci constitue une 
première victoire : nos mesures de politique monétaire ont permis d’écarter le 
risque de la déflation qui menaçait encore la zone euro l’année dernière – 
n’oublions pas que l’inflation était en recul, à – 0,2 %, en avril 2016.  
Cela étant, malgré les progrès vers notre cible, ceux-ci demeurent encore 
incomplets. L’inflation sous-jacente, hors énergie et produits alimentaires, a 
Page 3 sur 9 
 
 
certes progressé – elle est passée de 0,8 % au premier trimestre 2017 à 1,1 % 
en septembre 2017 – mais elle reste à des niveaux encore modestes, en dépit 
de la reprise soutenue de l’activité et de l’emploi.  
Un facteur notable est la croissance relativement faible des salaires nominaux. 
Parmi les causes conjoncturelles, je veux en mentionner deux en particulier : 
premièrement, le sous-emploi qui persiste sur le marché du travail – le taux de 
chômage a nettement baissé dans la zone euro, à 9,1 % en août 2017, mais il 
reste encore trop élevé ; deuxièmement, la dimension rétrospective des 
négociations salariales, qui fait que la faible inflation du passé se répercute 
dans les salaires d’aujourd’hui. L’influence de ces deux causes devrait 
cependant s’estomper avec la reprise de la croissance économique et de 
l’inflation.  
Structurellement, de nombreuses études
iii
 suggèrent que la courbe de Phillips 
– la relation qui existe entre l’inflation et les fluctuations de l’activité 
économique ou du chômage – se serait aplatie depuis les années 1980 [slide]. 
L’inflation réagirait moins aux évolutions de l’activité économique dans les 
pays avancés, notamment du fait de la mondialisation
iv
, qui exercerait une 
pression à la baisse sur l’inflation par la diminution des prix des produits 
importés et la concurrence des pays à bas salaires. Mais qui dit aplatissement 
de la courbe de Phillips ne dit pas absence de lien. Nous n’avons donc pas de 
doute sur la direction : la reprise et les créations d’emplois se traduiront par 
plus de salaires et, in fine, plus d’inflation. Nous avons en revanche une 
interrogation sur le rythme de cet ajustement. Nous sommes donc à la fois 
confiants dans l’efficacité de notre politique monétaire, et prêts à être patients 
sur la durée de celle-ci.  
 
II. Les perspectives : réduire de façon appropriée les achats d’actifs tout 
en conservant globalement une orientation significativement 
accommodante de la politique monétaire 
Page 4 sur 9 
 
 
J’en viens maintenant aux implications pour notre politique monétaire. Vous 
savez tous que le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE décidera cet automne 
de la façon dont il va recalibrer ses instruments de politique monétaire au-delà 
de la fin de l’année – et, je cite Mario Draghi, « pour l’essentiel ces décisions 
seront probablement prises en octobre ». Nous sommes aujourd’hui face à 
une exigence simple, en lien avec notre mandat de maintien de la stabilité des 
prix, et les progrès vers notre cible d’inflation : nous devons réduire l’intensité 
de nos achats nets d’actifs tout en conservant globalement une orientation 
significativement accommodante de notre politique monétaire.  
S’agissant de nos achats d’actifs, nous devons en réduire l’intensité de 
manière pragmatique, comme nous l’avons déjà décidé avec succès en 
décembre 2016. « Pragmatique » car, tout en maintenant les règles actuelles 
– nous ne devons modifier aucun des paramètres, y compris les limites de 
détention par émetteur et par émission –, nous pouvons, d’une part, exploiter 
les marges de flexibilité du programme et nous devons, d’autre part, garder en 
réserve une capacité d’achat supplémentaire – si nécessaire. Par conséquent, 
il n’y a aucune raison de redouter la perspective d’une réduction appropriée de 
nos achats nets, qui serait parfaitement compatible avec le maintien d’une 
orientation monétaire significativement accommodante.  
En effet, l’assouplissement quantitatif (QE) ne se limite pas aux achats 
nets d’actifs, et la politique monétaire ne se limite pas à 
l’assouplissement quantitatif. Notre politique monétaire s’appuie sur un 
ensemble d’instruments [slide] : ce n’est pas un solo, mais un quatuor. 
Outre l’assouplissement quantitatif, nous jouons avec les taux d’intérêt 
directeurs, la forward guidance (c’est-à-dire les indications que nous donnons 
sur la trajectoire future de ces taux) et la fourniture de liquidité aux institutions 
financières. 
1/ Concernant l’assouplissement quantitatif, le « QE », la littérature 
économique montre que l’impact des programmes d’achats d’actifs sur la 
courbe des rendements et sur les prix des actifs dépend principalement du 
Page 5 sur 9 
 
 
stock total d’actifs détenus par la banque centrale (ce que l’on appelle « l’effet 
stock »), plus que du flux des transactions réalisées sur une période donnée 
(« l’effet flux ») [slide]. Des études des effets du programme PSPP réalisées à 
la Banque de France montrent que la détention d’un stock d’obligations 
représentant 10 % du PIB fait baisser le rendement à dix ans de 45 points de 
base environ dans la zone euro
v
. Ces résultats impliquent que notre 
programme actuel fait baisser d’environ 100 points de base le rendement des 
obligations souveraines à dix ans en zone euro. Ces estimations sont du 
même ordre que les résultats obtenus pour les évaluations des programmes 
menés aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni
vi
.  
Dans tous les cas, l’Eurosystème restera un acquéreur important d’obligations 
libellées en euros dans les prochaines années, du fait de l’engagement de 
réinvestissement que nous avons pris en décembre 2015 et qui n’a peut-être 
pas été suffisamment remarqué : les remboursements des obligations venant 
à échéance seront intégralement réinvestis, ce qui permettra de maintenir 
inchangée la taille de nos portefeuilles d’actifs. En outre, l’échéance de ces 
réinvestissements peut être calibrée, si cela est nécessaire, afin de soutenir la 
duration que nous extrairons du marché.  Cela implique que nous allons 
continuer à exercer des pressions à la baisse sur la courbe des rendements 
en maintenant notre stock d’actifs à un niveau élevé sur une période 
prolongée, et nous pourrions le préciser dans notre communication. 
2/ La mesure probablement la moins conventionnelle est l’utilisation de taux 
d’intérêt négatifs. Les taux d’intérêt négatifs ont des limites ; je les ai déjà 
exposées par le passé
vii
. Et lors de la réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs à 
Tallinn en juin dernier, nous avons clarifié ces limites dans notre forward 
guidance, en déclarant que nous n’avions pas l’intention d’abaisser le taux de 
la facilité de dépôt au-dessous de son niveau actuel de – 0,40 %. Cependant, 
des taux d’intérêt légèrement négatifs ont des vertus. Premièrement, en 
supprimant la contrainte du plancher à zéro (zero lower bound) pesant sur les 
anticipations de taux d’intérêt à court terme futurs, ils contribuent à assouplir 
les conditions financières en abaissant les taux le long de la courbe, ce qui a 
Page 6 sur 9 
 
 
un impact positif sur la demande de crédit des entreprises. Deuxièmement, le 
taux négatif de la facilité de dépôt interagit positivement avec les achats 
d’actifs. De fait, l’effet de rééquilibrage des portefeuilles induit par 
l’assouplissement quantitatif est renforcé par le taux négatif de la facilité de 
dépôt : les banques détenant un excédent de liquidité sont davantage incitées 
à utiliser leurs réserves. Et nous n’avons pas, pour le moment, constaté 
d’effets véritablement adverses des taux négatifs sur la rentabilité des 
banques, y compris grâce au fait, favorable, que la pente de la courbe des 
rendements est restée positive.  
3/ Notre forward guidance fournit des informations supplémentaires 
concernant la trajectoire future de notre politique monétaire ; et grâce au 
pilotage des anticipations, elle a un impact sur la courbe des rendements. 
Notre forward guidance explicite clairement la séquence : « nous prévoyons 
que [les taux d’intérêt directeurs de la BCE] resteront à leurs niveaux actuels 
sur une période prolongée, et bien au-delà de l’horizon fixé pour les achats 
nets d’actifs ». Il n’y a aucun doute au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs quant 
à cette séquence. En tous les cas, nous ne devrions pas envisager de 
relèvement des taux d’intérêt avant d’avoir observé un ajustement durable de 
l’évolution de l’inflation.  
4/ Le quatrième instrument est la fourniture de liquidité aux institutions 
financières. En octobre 2008, nous avons introduit la procédure d’appel 
d’offres à taux fixe avec allocation intégrale des soumissions (fixed-rate full 
allotment) pour l’ensemble de nos opérations régulières de refinancement. La 
durée de cette fourniture de liquidité a ensuite été étendue avec l’introduction 
des opérations de refinancement à plus long terme (LTRO) d’une durée de 
trois ans et, ensuite, des opérations de refinancement à plus long terme 
ciblées (TLTRO). En septembre 2017, 760 milliards d’euros au total, soit plus 
de 7 % du PIB de la zone euro, sont encore prêtés aux banques de la zone 
euro par le biais des TLTRO, ce qui est considérable.

III. Relayer la politique monétaire en Europe  
Pour l’avenir, nous pouvons avoir confiance, car notre politique monétaire est 
efficace et la reprise est solide. Mais notre confiance doit être sans 
complaisance, car la politique monétaire ne peut pas tout faire : elle doit être 
relayée par des réformes au niveau national, et par un renforcement de la 
zone euro. « Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town ». Nous le 
disons depuis longtemps, mais c’est maintenant qu’il faut agir. 
C’est maintenant, en France, où l’accélération des réformes est une priorité, 
autour de deux grands axes : d’une part, le rétablissement durable de nos 
finances publiques, et d’autre part, une ambition de transformation globale, 
avec un effort conséquent de simplifications sur le marché du travail comme 
sur celui des biens et services, et un investissement massif dans l’éducation, 
la formation professionnelle et l’apprentissage. Même s’il faut persévérer dans 
cette direction, c’est la démarche dans laquelle le nouveau gouvernement 
semble s’être engagé, avec notamment la réforme du code du travail dès cet 
été, et l’effort de réduction du déficit public à 2,6 % dans le budget 2018, 
nettement sous le seuil des 3 % pour la première fois depuis onze ans.   
C’est maintenant en Europe, surtout. Nous ne pouvons pas à la fois vouloir 
éviter la surcharge de la politique monétaire – nos amis allemands ont raison 
là-dessus – et refuser l’Union économique qui est la condition d’une Union 
monétaire plus saine. Alors évitons de nous laisser ralentir par les mauvais 
débats ou les faux procès : il n’est pas question de mettre en place une 
« Union de transferts », qui ne profiterait qu’à certains pays ; nous ne devons 
pas non plus nous enliser dans les questions de méthode, entre les partisans 
de l’intergouvernemental et ceux de la méthode communautaire. Il est urgent 
aujourd’hui d’avancer sur le fond et de passer à la vitesse supérieure, en 
mettant en action quatre accélérateurs de l’Union économique : 
- Un accélérateur macro : le Président français, M. Macron, dans son 
discours sur l’Europe il y a dix jours, a commencé par la « coordination des 
politiques économiques ». Dans un discours très commenté, ceci n’a je 
Page 8 sur 9 
 
 
crois pas été assez remarqué. À mon sens – et je le dis avec mon 
indépendance de banquier central – ce que nous devons viser là c’est une 
vraie stratégie économique collective ; un engagement mutuel entre les 
États membres de la zone euro, pour davantage de réformes dans les pays 
où elles sont nécessaires, et davantage de soutien budgétaire dans les 
pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre. Cette stratégie collective 
pourrait être préparée et adoptée dès 2018. Elle pourrait être complétée 
par la création d’un fonds commun de stabilisation, pour aider par des prêts 
les États confrontés à un choc asymétrique. Ceci peut faire partie d’un 
Fonds monétaire européen, si ses missions sont élargies au-delà de 
l’actuel Mécanisme européen de stabilité.  
- Un accélérateur micro : il s’agit ici d’une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation. L’objectif est de mobiliser les 350 milliards 
d’euros d’excédent d’épargne de la zone euro, notamment en faveur des 
fonds propres qui sont la clé d’une économie d’innovation, et de mettre en 
synergie, grâce à un pilotage intégré, le plan Juncker, l’Union des marchés 
de capitaux et l’Union bancaire. Là aussi, les progrès peuvent être rapides.  
- Un accélérateur budgétaire, dès lors que nous aurons consolidé la 
confiance mutuelle entre les États et progressé vers davantage de 
convergence économique : le budget de la zone euro servirait à financer, 
au bénéfice de tous les pays, certains « biens communs européens » dont 
le numérique, la transition énergétique, la sécurité, la protection face aux 
migrations.  
- Un accélérateur institutionnel : c’est d’abord un Ministre des finances de 
la zone euro, président de l’Eurogroupe et membre de la Commission, 
appuyé sur un Trésor européen ; mais c’est aussi une formation euro du 
Parlement, pour assurer la légitimité démocratique des institutions et des 
décisions.  
Ces deux derniers accélérateurs, budgétaire et institutionnel, supposent des 
changements de Traités, sauf à n’être que très partiels. Cela ne doit pas nous 
Page 9 sur 9 
 
 
empêcher de progresser dès à présent sur les deux premiers, pour remettre 
en marche l’Union économique.

Je voudrais conclure mon propos aujourd’hui avec vous en citant Stefan 
Zweig, l’un des plus grands écrivains autrichiens. Il a écrit de très belles pages 
à la suite de sa visite à la Banque de France à Paris, en 1932
viii
. Mais il a 
surtout rendu hommage à sa ville natale en ces termes : « Le génie de Vienne 
– génie proprement musical – a toujours été d'harmoniser en soi tous les 
contrastes ethniques et linguistiques, sa culture est une synthèse de toutes les 
cultures occidentales, celui qui vivait et travaillait là se sentait libre de toute 
étroitesse et de tout préjugé. »
ix
 J’admire cet esprit viennois, qui mêle audace 
et liberté, et qui a été le berceau des plus grands esprits de notre époque 
contemporaine. Aujourd’hui, alors que l’heure de l’Europe peut revenir à 
nouveau, je souhaite que cet esprit continue de nous inspirer. Je vous 
remercie de votre attention.

Monsieur le Président,  
Monsieur le Secrétaire perpétuel, 
Mesdames et Messieurs les académiciens, 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un honneur pour moi de m’exprimer devant vous cet après-midi et je 
tiens à remercier chaleureusement votre Président Michel Pébereau pour son 
aimable invitation. Je salue aussi la présence de certains de mes 
prédécesseurs au sein de votre illustre assemblée, et non des moindres : 
Jacques de Larosière et Jean-Claude Trichet. Vous avez très heureusement 
choisi pour cette année le thème des réformes. Le terme a en France souvent 
trop peu de place, entre notre goût supposé pour les révolutions et notre 
conservatisme de fait. Il faut Tocqueville pour tenter de redonner à notre 
histoire  la patience des efforts dans la durée : « [La Révolution française]  
a pris, il est vrai, le monde à l'improviste, et cependant elle n'était que le 
complément du plus long travail, la terminaison soudaine et violente d'une 
œuvre à laquelle dix générations d'hommes avaient travaillé. »ii L’exemple de 
nos voisins, de l’Allemagne à l’Espagne, nous le montre cependant aujourd’hui 
: les réformes, cela marche en Europe. Elles sont même le chemin, le seul 
chemin, pour rendre compatible notre modèle social européen – légitime – et 
la croissance économique – indispensable pour faire reculer le chômage et 
financer notre avenir. 
 
Aujourd’hui, je centrerai mon propos sur d’autres réformes, non moins 
importantes, mises en place dans un contexte particulièrement troublé :  
les régulations financières décidées après la crise de 2007-2009. Est-il besoin 
de rappeler les conséquences désastreuses provoquées par celle-ci sur 
l’économie réelle, les drames sociaux, et la fragmentation démocratique avec 
la montée des populismes ? La stabilité financière est donc un bien commun 
sur lequel il est essentiel de veiller. Elle figure parmi les trois missions 
centrales de la Banque de France, aux côtés de la stratégie monétaire et des 
services à l'économie. Nous nous y sommes résolument engagés, au sein des 
 
 
 
instances internationales qui ont coordonné les réformes financières après la 
crise. L’urgence commandait d’agir avec rapidité et efficacité, et dès avril 
2009, le G20 a lancé un plan d’action concerté à l’échelle mondiale. Cet 
après-midi, je souhaite dans un premier temps éclairer le lien ambivalent entre 
finance et croissance, et en conséquence  la nécessité d’une régulation 
financière. Puis, je m’attarderai sur ce qui a été fait, avec un premier bilan de 
nos acquis. J’en viendrai enfin à nos défis pour l’avenir.  
** 
 
I. Le lien ambivalent entre finance et croissance 
 
Je tiens à le dire d’emblée : la finance est un formidable instrument du progrès 
économique, décisif dans le décollage du capitalisme européen puis mondial 
depuis le XVIe siècle. Pour soutenir le commerce d’abord, l’investissement 
ensuite, l’innovation aujourd’hui, – et ainsi la croissance –, il est bien 
évidemment indispensable de créer des conditions propices au financement 
de l’économie et à des institutions financières solides.  
 
De nombreux travaux académiques iii  confirment que la finance contribue 
positivement à la croissance économique car elle réduit les coûts de 
transaction et d’information et permet une meilleure allocation du capital.  
On estime par exemple qu’entre 1960 et 1995, certains pays en 
développement auraient pu connaître des taux de croissance du PIB 
supérieurs de 0,4 à 1 point de PIB par an si leur système financier avait été 
davantage développé iv . Certains auteurs vont même jusqu’à affirmer qu’il 
serait préférable de laisser jouer les forces du marché sans se soucier de 
l’apparition de bulles ou de déséquilibres financiers qui se résorberaient par 
eux-mêmes. Les crises financières seraient alors simplement le prix à payer à 
court terme pour une croissance plus forte à moyen ou long terme. Les 
conclusions de ces travaux sont pour autant trop radicales, à l’évidence : elles 
feraient de la finance le maître de l’économie et non un instrument à son 
 
 
 
service, un instrument subordonné à une finalité, celle du travail et du progrès 
des hommes.  
 
Comme toute activité humaine en effet, la finance n’est pas à l’abri de 
certains excès, ni de certaines limites. Des étudesv ont mis en évidence 
l’instabilité intrinsèque du système financier. L’existence de comportements de 
prise de risque excessive – les économistes Guttentag et Herring utilisaient le 
concept de « myopie face au désastre » vi  – ou la possibilité de paniques 
bancaires sont autant d’exemples de défaillances de marché ou d’externalités 
négatives, qui justifient l’intervention publique et la régulation financière. De 
même, certains indicateurs, qui sont initialement des signes de 
développement économique, peuvent par excès traduire un emballement du 
système financier, potentiellement déstabilisateur pour la croissance. Ainsi,  
il est couramment admis qu’un volume de dettes trop élevé par rapport au 
produit intérieur brut aurait un impact négatif sur la croissance à long 
termevii.  Au-delà de la dette publique – objet d’un rapport de votre Président 
en 2005, hélas toujours actuel –, la dette privée en France atteint aujourd’hui 
130 % du PIB, contre 122 % en zone euro et 150 % aux États-Unisviii. La 
règlementation peut et doit jouer un rôle protecteur, en fixant certaines limites 
en amont et en renforçant les capacités de résistance aux impacts 
déstabilisateurs en aval. Un Rabelais du XXIe siècle dirait sans doute que 
finance sans conscience n’est que ruine de l’âme. À la conscience individuelle, 
je reviendrai en conclusion. Mais assurément, une finance sans règles peut 
être ruine de l’économie.  
  
La régulation financière apparaît en effet d’autant plus nécessaire que les 
crises financières ont des coûts économiques et sociaux souvent 
considérables, avec des répercussions profondes et durables. Une étude de 
Laeven et Valenciaix  de 2013, qui répertorie 147 crises bancaires entre 1970 
et 2011, évalue la perte cumulée médiane de la production à environ 23 % du 
PIB entre le pic d’activité précédant la crise et les trois années qui suivent. Sur 
 
 
 
cette même période, l’accroissement médian de la dette publique atteint 12 % 
du PIB, tandis la somme des dépenses publiques liées aux plans de 
sauvetage se monte à près de 7 points de PIB. En outre, au-delà des effets 
immédiats, les crises financières réduisent le potentiel de croissance de 
l’économie à long terme : les entreprises limitent en effet leurs investissements 
en recherche et développement, en capital et en infrastructures, ce qui 
entraîne une baisse de la productivité et un ralentissement du progrès 
technologique.  
 
La crise de 2007-2009 en a malheureusement été une illustration ; elle a 
été  la plus grave depuis celle des années 1930. Les déséquilibres financiers 
engendrés par l’éclatement de la bulle des subprimes aux États-Unis se sont 
rapidement propagés à l’économie mondiale. La crise a affecté à la fois le 
niveau et la tendance du PIB, provoquant une perte définitive de richesse.  
Les pertes cumulées de PIB par rapport à la tendance d’avant-crise sont 
estimées à un quart du PIB mondial x. Dans un certain nombre de pays, 
notamment en Europe du Sud, le PIB n’a toujours pas retrouvé son niveau 
d’avant-crise.   
  
II. Les nouvelles régulations ont renforcé la solidité du secteur financier, 
sans peser de façon notable sur la croissance économique. 
 
Par son coût exorbitant, la crise de 2007-2009 a mis en évidence la nécessité 
absolue de renforcer la stabilité financière, et la réponse a été forte. Dès 2009, 
les leaders du G20, réunis à Londres puis à Pittsburgh, se sont hissés à la 
hauteur de leur mission historique et ont fixé un agenda ambitieux de 
coopération internationale. Les premières phrases du communiqué du sommet 
de Londres méritent encore d’être citées aujourd'hui : « Une crise globale 
nécessite une solution globale […]. Nous pensons que la seule fondation sûre 
d’une mondialisation soutenable et de l’augmentation de la prospérité pour 
tous est une économie ouverte fondée sur le principe de marché, une 
 
 
 
régulation efficace et des institutions mondiales solides. Nous nous sommes 
par conséquent  engagés à faire tout le nécessaire pour : rétablir la confiance, 
la croissance et l’emploi ; réparer le système financier pour restaurer les flux 
normaux de crédit ; renforcer les réglementations financières pour rétablir la 
confiance. » 
 
Cet effort réglementaire sans précédent a concerné l’ensemble des acteurs 
du système financier. Quatre objectifs principaux ont été fixés : (i) rendre les 
institutions financières plus « résilientes », c’est-à-dire plus solides et plus 
résistantes face aux crises (ii) mettre fin au problème des institutions 
financières considérées comme « trop grandes pour faire faillite » – « too big 
to fail » en anglais – qui bénéficiaient implicitement d’une garantie de 
renflouement par les États, (iii) rendre les marchés de produits dérivés de gré 
à gré plus sûrs grâce notamment à leur compensation centralisée, (iv) et 
transformer les activités de marché non régulées, le « shadow banking » ou 
secteur financier parallèle, en financement sain de marché. La déclinaison 
opérationnelle de ces orientations prioritaires a été confiée, au plan 
international, au Conseil de stabilité financière (Financial Stability Board) ainsi 
qu’au Comité de Bâle, où la Banque de France et l’Autorité de Contrôle 
prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) sont actives.  
 
Ces quatre objectifs du G20 ont, bien qu'inégalement, tous significativement 
progressé depuis 2010. Je me concentrerai ici sur le premier : les institutions 
financières sont désormais plus résistantes. Les accords de Bâle III, adoptés 
en 2010, renforcent le niveau et la qualité des fonds propres pour le secteur 
bancaire ; ils introduisent aussi une meilleure prise en compte de la diversité 
des risques auxquels les banques sont exposées, avec un ratio de levier – par 
rapport au total du bilan non pondéré – et deux nouveaux ratios de liquidité, 
sur la trésorerie des banques. Le secteur de l’assurance a également vu ses 
exigences renforcées avec l’entrée en application du nouveau cadre 
réglementaire issu de la directive Solvabilité II, début 2016 en Europe. Le taux 
 
 
 
de couverture des risques des organismes d’assurance français soumis à 
Solvabilité II se situait à 222 % fin 2016, soit un niveau bien supérieur aux 
100 % requis. Ces différents outils, dits microprudentiels parce qu’ils visent à 
réduire les risques individuels auxquels s’exposent les institutions financières, 
ont été complétés par des outils dits macroprudentiels, centrés sur la stabilité 
du système financier dans son ensemble. En France, le développement de la 
politique macroprudentielle s’est traduit par la création dans la loi bancaire de 
2013 du Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière (HCSF), présidé par le Ministre 
des Finances, avec un rôle actif de la Banque de France. Ce Haut Conseil se 
réunit une fois par trimestre, avec huit membres dont trois économistes 
indépendants. Il porte un diagnostic sur le risque d'éventuelles ""bulles"" 
financières ; il a le pouvoir d’activer, si nécessaire, un ensemble de mesures 
macroprudentielles, telles qu’un « coussin » de fonds propres contracyclique – 
actuellement fixé à 0 % – ou encore une fixation plus stricte des conditions 
d’octroi de crédit.  
 
Dix ans après le début de la crise, huit ans après Londres et Pittsburgh, 
l’heure est au bilan. Notre acquis aujourd’hui est que l’objectif a été en bonne 
partie atteintxi. Les premiers travaux d’évaluation montrent que l’effet de ces 
réformes sur la solidité des institutions bancaires a été largement positif, 
tant du point de vue de leur capacité à résister à un choc de liquidité, que du 
point de vue de leur solvabilité, le ratio de fonds propres durs (Common Equity 
Tier 1 ou CET1) des principales banques opérant à l’échelle internationale 
ayant augmenté de 5 points de pourcentage depuis 2011, passant de 7,4 % 
fin 2011 à 12,3 % fin 2016xii. Quant aux principales banques françaises, leurs 
fonds propres ont plus que doublé depuis la crise : leur montant s’élevait à 
132 milliards d’euros en 2008 ; il a atteint 296 milliards d’euros en 2016. Pour 
le dire autrement, les banques françaises ont  fait dans les huit dernières 
années un chemin en capital plus important encore que celui qu'elles avaient 
fait jusque-là en plus d'un siècle, pour la plupart d'entre elles.  
 
 
 
 
Ce renforcement de la solidité des institutions financières ne s’est pas fait au 
détriment de l’activité économique. J’aborde ici le cœur de la question que 
votre Académie me pose aujourd’hui. D’emblée, la volonté des régulateurs 
était clairement de limiter les potentiels effets négatifs des réformes sur 
l’économie réelle et de faire en sorte que les activités financières soient 
bénéfiques à la croissance et au développement économique. Dès 2010, 
avant la mise en œuvre de Bâle III, des travaux d’envergurexiii avaient été 
conduits afin de mesurer l’impact de ces réformes. Le Macroeconomic 
Assessment Group du Comité de Bâle avait conclu, avec une fourchette large 
d’estimations, à un renchérissement moyen de l’ordre de 0,15 point du coût du 
crédit pour tout relèvement de 1 % du ratio de fonds propres. Ce 
renchérissement ne s’est pas produit en pratique. Les effets favorables de la 
baisse des taux d’intérêt induite par les politiques monétaires accommodantes 
ont beaucoup plus que compensé d’éventuels effets négatifs liés à 
l’accroissement des exigences prudentielles. Aujourd’hui en Europe, comme 
en France, l’offre de crédits bancaires aux entreprises et aux ménages est 
dynamique. Ce dynamisme des crédits au secteur privé est même un sujet de 
vigilance en France au sein du HCSF. En septembre 2017, le taux de 
croissance des crédits bancaires aux ménages et aux entreprises s’est en 
effet établi à respectivement 5,7 % et 5,4 % en France, soit un rythme deux 
fois supérieur à celui de la zone euro. Depuis début 2010, leur croissance 
cumulée (+ 29 %) a été presque deux fois supérieure à celle du PIB nominal. 
Personne ne peut donc plaider sérieusement que les réformes financières ont 
à ce jour restreint le crédit en France, et par là la croissance. Et parallèlement, 
relevons que le système bancaire français – parmi les plus solides d’Europe et 
du monde – a fait son travail de financement de l’économie. Au-delà du seul 
secteur bancaire français, le Conseil de Stabilité Financière a également 
constaté à l'échelle mondiale une amélioration de la résilience de l’ensemble 
des institutions financières sans diminution de la fourniture de financements à 
l’économie réellexiv.  
 
 
 
 
Je veux ajouter quelques mots sur ce qui me semble être un faux débat. Si 
l’Europe a connu une reprise de l’activité économique plus lente que dans les 
autres zones géographique, cette situation ne s’explique pas par un surcroît 
de réglementation. Les répercussions de la crise de la dette touchant depuis 
les années 2010 ses pays membres expliquent en partie l’ampleur et les 
difficultés de la zone euro. Par ailleurs, certains problèmes plus 
spécifiquement européens ou français tels que le ralentissement de la 
productivité et l’insuffisance des réformes structurelles limitent également 
l’accélération de la croissance. Enfin, jusqu’à présent au moins, les 
réglementations ont globalement été appliquées par les États-Unis au moins 
autant que par l’Europe.  
  
III. Cinq défis pour parachever une régulation équilibrée.  
 
Cela étant dit, je me garderai bien de tout angélisme au sujet de ces nouvelles 
règlementations. Cinq défis sont encore devant nous et je voudrais, si vous 
me le permettez, les passer en revue.  
 
1) Le premier défi consiste à achever les règles de capital pour les 
banques, en finalisant la réforme de Bâle III. L’essentiel du travail, disons 
80 %, a été fait : les principaux éléments ont été approuvés dès 2010-2011 et 
sont à présent largement mis en application. Il reste cependant des 
discussions en cours concernant la pondération du risque dans les bilans des 
banques. L’objectif en est de réduire la variabilité qui serait non justifiée de 
cette pondération entre banques, ou entre pays. Ceci ne doit cependant pas 
se faire au prix d’une uniformisation, car la variabilité des résultats reflète 
aussi des profils de risque différents. La sensibilité au risque permise par les 
modèles internes des banques est une grande avancée, car elle permet de 
garantir la proportionnalité des exigences par rapport aux risques pris. Il faut 
bien sûr renforcer la confiance en supervisant étroitement ces modèles 
internes, comme le font l’ACPR depuis longtemps et le Mécanisme de 
 
 
 
Supervision Unique (MSU) à Francfort aujourd’hui. Mais il s’agit bien de 
finaliser Bâle III, et non de construire un nouveau Bâle IV, qui serait fondé 
principalement sur une approche standard ignorante par définition des 
différences entre pays et entre banques.  
 
La France, qui agit depuis toujours pour des règles du jeu internationales, a un 
intérêt stratégique à conclure un accord final. De nombreux progrès ont été 
faits, notamment lors de la dernière réunion du Comité de Bâle les 4 et 
5 octobre derniers, mais nous ne sommes pas encore à un accord même si je 
le souhaite aussi rapidement que possible. Pour y parvenir, deux conditions 
sont impératives. L’accord doit d’abord être équitable, c’est-à-dire qu’il doit 
être appliqué dans toutes ses composantes par tous les pays, y compris par 
les Américains sur la mesure des risques de marché, soit le portefeuille de 
négociation, ou « FRTB » (fundamental review of the trading book). L’accord 
doit ensuite être raisonnable, dans les augmentations de capital qui en 
résulteront pour les banques françaises et européennes – y compris via 
l’introduction d’un plancher applicable aux exigences de fonds propres pour 
les banques utilisant les modèles internes, ce que l’on appelle l’« output 
floor ». D’une part, ces exigences en capital doivent pouvoir être couvertes 
dans la durée par des mises en réserve « normales » de résultats, sans 
nécessiter pour aucune banque d’augmentation de capital dédiée. D’autre 
part, ces nouvelles règles doivent être totalement compatibles avec le bon 
financement de l’économie française et européenne, et la saine croissance du 
crédit. En particulier, il ne peut y avoir aucune remise en cause de notre 
modèle de crédit immobilier, fondé sur les crédits cautionnés, ou du 
financement des PME. Tels sont les principes qui guideront pour moi 
l’acceptation d’un éventuel accord. 
 
2) Le second défi est de compléter les travaux visant les non-banques. 
Tout d’abord, les travaux sur la « résolution » des chambres de compensation 
– leur traitement en cas de difficulté – doivent se poursuivre, le caractère 
 
 
 
systémique de celles-ci ayant augmenté avec l’obligation de compensation 
centralisée des produits dérivés. Surtout, nous devons veiller à l’équilibre des 
circuits de financement. L’ensemble des réflexions portant sur le système 
financier parallèle, le shadow banking, doit se poursuivre, afin de tenir compte 
des risques qui ont pu se déplacer vers ce secteur, en raison de 
l’intensification des exigences dans le secteur régulé – banques et assurances 
notamment. On estime que les segments susceptibles de mettre en danger la 
stabilité financière y représentent au total 34 000 milliards de dollarsxv. La 
priorité désormais est moins la solvabilité des banques, qui a été nettement 
améliorée, que la liquidité du shadow banking, en particulier les fonds et les 
gestionnaires d’actifs qui sont exposés à des risques de retraits massifs et 
soudains en cas de panique.  Enfin, des progrès sont encore à réaliser sur les 
FinTechs et avant tout sur les grandes plateformes et entreprises numériques. 
Ces dernières, si elles exercent des activités financières, devront obéir à des 
règles similaires, tôt ou tard.  
 
3) Troisième défi : l’évaluation. Il s’agit d’une composante essentielle de la 
crédibilité des réformes financières mondiales qui ont été adoptées. À cet 
effet, le G20 a adopté l’été dernier un cadre d’évaluation ex post. Celui-ci doit 
permettre de juger si, en pratique, les réformes ont effectivement abouti aux 
résultats voulus, sans provoquer d’effets négatifs ou inattendus, et de les 
ajuster s'il y a lieu. Deux premières évaluations ont déjà été lancées : celle de 
l’efficacité des réformes incitant à la compensation centralisée, et celle de 
l’impact des réformes du G20 sur l’accès au financement. Celle-ci portera sur 
le financement des infrastructures puis se concentrera sur le crédit aux petites 
et moyennes entreprises (PME). De premiers rapports d’évaluation devraient 
être rendus publics d’ici la fin de l’année 2018. 
 
4) Quatrième défi, pour consolider nos avancées : s’assurer que le nouveau 
cadre réglementaire est mis en œuvre partout avec constance, et rester 
vigilant afin d’éviter tout retour en arrière. « En toute chose humaine, la 
 
 
 
constance n'est-elle pas la plus haute expression de la force? » 
écrivait  Balzac dans le Médecin de campagne, réservant légitimement cette 
vertu aux plus grands hommes de son temps. Or comme vous le savez, les 
nouvelles autorités américaines ont évoqué  la possibilité de revoir leurs 
réglementations bancaires nationales xvi . Certains ajustements nationaux 
peuvent  être jugés appropriés et légitimes. C’est le cas par exemple des 
réglementations applicables aux entités opérant uniquement à l'échelle locale, 
ou des réglementations proprement américaines comme la règle Volcker sur 
les portefeuilles pour compte propre. Il en irait tout autrement de l’abandon 
des exigences minimales approuvées au niveau international qui s’appliquent 
aux entités opérant à l’échelle mondiale, comme la réforme des risques de 
marché que j'ai citée. Une déréglementation unilatérale ne serait qu’un jeu 
perdant-perdant ; elle aurait de graves conséquences tant sur la stabilité du 
système financier mondial – nous mettrions en germe les conditions de la 
prochaine crise financière – que sur les conditions de concurrence entre 
banques américaines et européennes. La coopération internationale sur les 
réformes financières est notre bien commun, très précieux depuis ces huit 
dernières années et vital pour notre avenir.  
 
5) Le cinquième défi est de compléter le cadre européen et lui donner 
davantage de cohérence entre réglementation, supervision et résolution. 
La zone euro a depuis 2014 fait un progrès décisif avec son Union bancaire, 
qui surveille désormais de façon homogène les banques des dix-neuf pays. 
Mais son achèvement  doit se faire à trois niveaux. D’abord, dans les 
mécanismes concrets : il est indispensable de finaliser et simplifier le second 
pilier de l’Union bancaire qu’est la « résolution » en cas de difficulté. Ensuite, 
dans les textes et exigences : celles-ci sont encore trop souvent additionnées 
par divers règlements, plutôt qu'articulées de façon cohérente ; les fusions 
bancaires transfrontières en Europe restent en outre trop difficiles.  Enfin, dans 
l’interaction des institutions : il est souhaitable de parvenir à une meilleure 
combinaison entre les différentes autorités européennes, voire d’envisager, à 
 
 
 
terme, une autorité unique qui œuvrerait en faveur de la solidité du secteur 
bancaire européen. Au-delà de l’aspect règlementaire, il faut œuvrer à la mise 
en œuvre de ce que j’appelle l’Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation. L’objectif est de mieux orienter vers les besoins d’investissement 
les 350 milliards d’euros annuels d’excédent d’épargne en zone euro et 
d’encourager la mutualisation des risques privés via notamment  le 
développement des fonds propres  des entreprises. 
** 
 
Je souhaite conclure en évoquant un sixième et dernier défi : les limites 
inhérentes à toute réglementation, aussi bonne soit-elle. Tout d’abord, la 
stabilité financière ne dépend pas que de la réglementation ; elle prend appui 
sur un trépied dont chacun des éléments a autant d’importance que les 
autres : la réglementation, la supervision microprudentielle et la politique 
macroprudentielle. Ensuite, et surtout, il y a une nécessaire complémentarité 
entre les règles collectives et les comportements individuels – l’éthique. Avant 
2007, l’autorégulation était la norme et le monde anglo-saxon en première 
ligne a fait preuve d’un excès de confiance dans la déontologie et le 
« business ethics ». Veillons aujourd'hui à ne pas faire repartir le balancier trop 
fortement dans l’autre sens. L’Académie des sciences morales et politiques 
est ici pour le rappeler : la règle ne se substituera jamais à la conscience 
individuelle. Ceci vaut aussi pour le secteur financier.  Je vous remercie de 
votre attention.

M. le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir pour moi d’être à Bruxelles aujourd’hui, un plaisir rare pour un 
banquier central... qui est plus souvent à Francfort. Je salue le fait qu’à 
EconPol Europe, vous ayez choisi l’euro comme thème de votre conférence 
inaugurale et je vous remercie de m’avoir invité à intervenir à cette occasion. 
Depuis Maastricht, il y a 25 ans, nous avons réussi à construire une union 
monétaire. Mais nous n’avons pas atteint nos objectifs en ce qui concerne 
l’union économique. Afin d’éviter de faire peser une charge trop importante 
sur la politique monétaire, notre Union doit marcher sur ses deux jambes et 
non sur une seule : c’est pourquoi nous sommes légitimes, comme banquiers 
centraux, à proposer des réflexions sur ce sujet, même si nous ne sommes 
pas – légitimement – ceux qui décident.  
 
Il est désormais urgent d’avancer sur l’union économique, d’autant plus que le 
contexte économique est à présent favorable, comme l’a confirmé aujourd’hui 
la Commission européenne. La croissance de la zone euro, de 2,2 % en 2017, 
devrait être la plus élevée depuis 10 ans et être aussi forte qu’aux des États-
Unis. Elle pourrait même être légèrement plus élevée que prévu pour la 
France (1,6 %), au regard des prévisions publiées ce matin par la Banque de 
France pour le quatrième trimestre (0,5 %). Elle sera soutenue au cours des 
deux prochaines années grâce à la vigueur de l’investissement et à une 
convergence accrue entre les pays. Ces prévisions, qui incluent une inflation 
positive mais toujours modérée, confirment l’opportunité de la normalisation 
progressive de la politique monétaire que nous avons engagée. 
 
Mais le débat risque aujourd’hui d’en rester à deux vieilles divisions : les 
« règles allemandes » contre les « dépenses françaises », et la « méthode 
communautaire » contre la « méthode intergouvernementale ». Il y a trop de 
peurs et de suspicions héritées du passé, alors que nous vivons des temps 
nouveaux – y compris grâce à l’accélération des réformes en France – et une 
Page 2 sur 10 
 
opportunité historique. À Rome, le 25 mars dernier, les États membres ont 
tous souhaité « l’achèvement de l’Union économique et monétaire ». Nous 
sommes d’accord sur le « pourquoi » : plus de stabilité, face au risque d’une 
prochaine crise qui trouverait la zone euro démunie ; et plus de croissance, 
pour combler notre retard passé par rapport aux États-Unis et traiter enfin la 
maladie mortelle du chômage de masse en Europe.  
 
Mais comment atteindre cet objectif partagé ? Il nous faut activer quatre 
accélérateurs : un accélérateur macro, qui consisterait en une stratégie 
économique collective partagée par l’ensemble des États membres de la zone 
euro ; un accélérateur micro, sous la forme d’une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation, qui irait plus loin que l’Union des marchés de 
capitaux ; un accélérateur budgétaire, qui s’appuierait sur un budget de la 
zone euro. Le quatrième accélérateur n’est pas sur le fond, mais serait plutôt 
un « facilitateur » des trois premiers : pour les institutions, un ministre des 
Finances de la zone euro et un parlement de la zone euro. 
 
 
 
Page 3 sur 10 
 
Ces accélérateurs contribueraient aux fonctions de la politique économique 
définies par Musgrave 
2
 : allocation, stabilisation et distribution. La fonction 
d’allocation vise à garantir l’efficacité de l’utilisation des ressources. Ce serait 
à l’évidence le rôle de l’accélérateur micro, mais également celui de 
l’accélérateur budgétaire, par le biais du financement des biens communs en 
Europe. La fonction de stabilisation consiste à lisser le cycle et à amortir 
l’effet des crises, ce qui  pourrait être assuré principalement par l’accélérateur 
macro, mais également par l’accélérateur micro, grâce à l’amélioration du 
partage du risque privé et, peut-être aussi, par l’accélérateur budgétaire. Enfin, 
la fonction de distribution devrait favoriser un partage équitable du revenu. 
Ce rôle pourrait éventuellement revenir à l’accélérateur budgétaire, mais sa 
mise en œuvre exigerait un renforcement de la confiance et de de la 
convergence économique entre les États membres de la zone euro afin 
d’éviter une « union de transfert » qui ne profiterait qu’à certains pays : dans 
ce cas, je comprendrais les craintes allemandes.  
 
Ces quatre accélérateurs sont donc nécessaires, mais cela ne signifie pas 
qu’ils doivent tous être mis en œuvre en même temps. Les deux derniers 
accélérateurs, l’accélérateur budgétaire et l’accélérateur institutionnel, 
supposent en effet de modifier les Traités, sauf à n’être que très partiels. 
Toutefois, cela ne doit pas nous empêcher de prendre immédiatement des 
mesures concernant les deux premiers accélérateurs, à savoir macro et micro, 
sur lesquels j’insisterai aujourd’hui. Je souhaite partager quelques réflexions, 
utiles pour les propositions que la Commission européenne remettra en 
décembre, et pour notre débat aujourd’hui. Plus précisément, je me 
concentrerai sur une partie de chacun de ces accélérateurs, où des progrès 
rapides peuvent être faits : j’insisterai d’abord sur la création d’un instrument 
de prêt pour la stabilisation (Stabilisation Lending Instrument - SLI) au sein de 
l’accélérateur macroéconomique, puis j’aborderai plus en détail l’achèvement 
de l’Union bancaire dans le cadre de l’accélérateur micro.  
Page 4 sur 10 
 
I. Un accélérateur macro, comprenant un instrument de prêt pour la 
stabilisation et éventuellement un Fonds monétaire européen. 
L’accélérateur macroéconomique repose sur un constat simple : la croissance 
et l’emploi seraient plus élevés dans la zone euro si nous combinions 
davantage de réformes structurelles dans les pays où elles sont nécessaires, 
comme la France ou l’Italie, et davantage de relance dans les pays disposant 
d’une marge de manœuvre à cet égard, comme l’Allemagne ou les Pays-Bas. 
Pour parvenir à cette stratégie économique collective, les États membres 
doivent sceller un accord, qui pourrait être préparé et adopté dès 2018.  
 
Outre cet engagement, je suggère également la création d’un instrument de 
prêt pour la stabilisation au niveau de la zone euro et je voudrais détailler 
quelques aspects fondamentaux s’agissant de ses objectifs et de son 
efficacité opérationnelle. J’évoquerai ensuite plus largement la possibilité d’un 
Fonds monétaire européen. 
 
Je commencerai par les objectifs. L’instrument de prêt pour la stabilisation 
fournirait des prêts aux États membres de la zone euro confrontés à un choc 
économique asymétrique, afin de soutenir leurs politiques contracycliques. La 
Finlande, par exemple, a été confrontée à un triple choc asymétrique à la fin 
des années 2000, en raison de la chute de Nokia, du déclin de l’industrie du 
papier et du contrecoup de la crise russe – le PIB en volume s’est contracté de 
9 % en 2009. Un tel choc pourrait aussi résulter, entre autres exemples, d’une 
incertitude politique temporaire – pourvu qu’elle ne soit pas due à des 
politiques économiques inadaptées –, de catastrophes naturelles ou d’une 
perte de confiance irrationnelle sur les marchés financiers provoquant une 
pression excessive sur l’écart de rendement (spread) souverain. L’instrument 
de prêt pour la stabilisation serait un complément des stabilisateurs nationaux 
et ne s’y substituerait pas. Il aiderait les États membres à ne pas abandonner 
Page 5 sur 10 
 
leurs investissements à long terme, en particulier en évitant un écart injustifié 
dans leurs conditions de financement.  
 
Au-delà de cet instrument de prêt pour la stabilisation, la création d’un « fonds 
pour les mauvais jours » (rainy day fund) doté de ressources budgétaires 
pourrait être envisagée à un stade ultérieur, une fois renforcées la confiance et 
la convergence économique entre les États membres. 
 
Concernant l’efficacité opérationnelle de l’instrument de prêt pour la 
stabilisation, l’accès à cet instrument devrait être simple, sur la base de 
critères macrofinanciers soigneusement sélectionnés. Les conditions 
minimales seraient, premièrement, que les États membres se conforment 
véritablement aux règles communes, à savoir le Pacte de stabilité et de 
croissance et la Procédure concernant les déséquilibres macroéconomiques, 
et, deuxièmement, qu’ils conduisent effectivement des politiques conformes à 
la stratégie économique collective de la zone euro. Toutefois, contrairement 
aux instruments du MES (Mécanisme européen de stabilité) utilisés jusqu’à 
présent, l’accès à l’instrument de prêt pour la stabilisation ne devrait pas être 
subordonné à la mise en œuvre d’un programme d’ajustement. Sa conception 
serait telle qu’il n’induirait pas de stigmatisation des États membres.  
 
La question de la gouvernance m’amène à une réflexion plus large sur l’idée 
d’un Fonds monétaire européen (FME). Un FME n’aurait de sens que si son 
rayon d’action et sa gouvernance dépassaient ceux du MES actuel. Sinon, 
pourquoi lui donner un autre nom ? Le rayon d’action d’un éventuel FME ne 
devrait pas se limiter à la gestion de crise. Nous devrions lui confier le rôle de 
prévention des crises au sens large, y compris les prêts conditionnels par le 
biais de l’instrument de prêt pour la stabilisation que j’ai proposé. Cela 
nécessiterait des processus de décision qui ne seraient pas paralysés par une 
Page 6 sur 10 
 
gouvernance fondée sur le droit de veto. En tant que président de 
l’Eurogroupe et membre de la Commission européenne, le ministre des 
Finances de la zone euro présiderait en toute logique le conseil des 
gouverneurs d’un FME et jouerait un rôle plus important dans les situations 
nécessitant l’avis du conseil. En temps voulu, il serait bénéfique de 
communautariser ce FME, c’est-à-dire d’ancrer cette institution dans le cadre 
du droit de l’Union. Dans ce cadre, et dans ce cadre seulement, il serait 
pertinent de confier à un FME une mission de surveillance élargie, y compris 
la tâche de contrôler le respect des règles communes, un rôle aujourd’hui 
assigné à la Commission européenne.  
 
II. Un accélérateur micro, comprenant l’achèvement de l’Union 
bancaire  
 
J’en viens maintenant à l’accélérateur microéconomique de l’Union 
économique : une Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation. 
L’objectif est de mieux orienter les 350 milliards d’euros d’excédent annuel 
d’épargne de la zone euro vers l’investissement productif, notamment en 
faveur des fonds propres qui sont la clé d’une économie de l’innovation. Grâce 
à une gouvernance unifiée, cette Union de financement permettrait de 
contourner les obstacles bureaucratiques et de renforcer les synergies entre 
Page 7 sur 10 
 
les composantes déjà existantes : le plan d’investissement Juncker, l’Union 
des marchés de capitaux et l’Union bancaire. Cependant, pour que cette 
Union de financement soit efficace, des progrès sont encore nécessaires dans 
quatre domaines clés : premièrement, en incitant aux investissements 
transfrontières (essentiellement en fonds propres) par le biais de réformes des 
règles comptables, de la fiscalité et des lois de faillite ; deuxièmement, en 
développant à l’échelle européenne des produits d’épargne de long terme – 
avec un rôle essentiel pour le secteur des assurances – et des véhicules 
d’investissement, tels que des fonds de capital-risque européens ; 
troisièmement, en achevant l’Union bancaire ; quatrièmement, en contrôlant 
les activités financières et les risques dont l’importance est vitale pour la zone 
euro, comme les contreparties centrales super-systémiques. Et ainsi, nous 
pourrions obtenir des gains significatifs pour la digitalisation, le développement 
des PME ou la transition énergétique. Je mettrai l’accent aujourd’hui sur le 
troisième aspect : l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire.  
 
L’Union bancaire, qui constitue une avancée majeure pour la zone euro, est 
désormais opérationnelle, sur la base d’une règlementation uniforme (single 
rulebook) et de deux piliers déjà en place : le mécanisme de surveillance 
unique (MSU) depuis fin 2014 ; et le mécanisme de résolution unique (MRU), 
depuis début 2016. Ces deux piliers devront être complétés par un troisième 
pilier relatif à la garantie des dépôts, pour lequel nous pourrions trouver des 
compromis pratiques et raisonnables. Mais j’insisterai également sur deux 
défis qui sont moins souvent mentionnés : la cohérence et les consolidations.  
 
Le premier défi consiste à parvenir à une meilleure cohérence entre 
réglementation, supervision et résolution, à trois niveaux :  
- premièrement, dans les mécanismes concrets : la finalisation et la 
simplification du pilier « résolution » devraient être une priorité. Le cas des 
banques italiennes a illustré à quel point il était complexe de combiner le 
Page 8 sur 10 
 
régime de résolution établi par la directive sur le redressement et la 
résolution des défaillances bancaires (BRRD) et le cadre des aides d’État 
visant à une liquidation ordonnée. Par ailleurs, il est nécessaire de 
renforcer la confiance dans le Fonds de résolution unique (FRU) et 
d’accroître sa capacité d’intervention. La mise en place d’un filet de 
sécurité commun, mentionné dans la communication de la Commission 
européenne du 11 octobre, constitue une piste prometteuse, qui pourrait 
prendre la forme d’une ligne de crédit accordée par le MES. Par ailleurs, la 
question de la liquidité des entités ayant récemment fait l’objet d’une 
résolution (essentiellement les « banques saines ») n’est pas traitée de 
façon suffisamment claire : il est important de clarifier le soutien en liquidité 
qui peut être apporté par des sources publiques, au-delà de celui qui peut 
être légitimement attendu de l’Eurosystème. 
 
- deuxièmement, la cohérence du cadre et des exigences juridiques : 
confrontés à l’accumulation d’exigences nouvelles et « séparées », nous 
devons adopter une approche holistique et cohérente afin d’éviter une 
surcharge prudentielle. En particulier, l’exigence en matière de capacité 
totale d’absorption des pertes (TLAC) résultant du nouveau cadre 
international nécessite au niveau européen une adaptation cohérente de 
l’exigence minimale pour les fonds propres et les engagements éligibles 
(MREL). De la même façon, les conséquences du paquet de réformes 
internationales de Bâle III, s’il était approuvé, doivent être attentivement 
prises en compte, car il entraînerait une augmentation des actifs pondérés 
des risques, ce qui aurait par ricochet un impact sur le MREL. Toutes ces 
évolutions, conjuguées aux exigences de fonds propres au titre du Pilier II, 
pourraient entraîner une surcalibration : chaque décision individuelle est 
peut-être nécessaire, mais pas leur accumulation quelque peu 
désordonnée. Et nous ne devons évidemment pas porter atteinte à l’égalité 
de traitement entre les banques de la zone euro et leurs concurrentes 
étrangères. 
Page 9 sur 10 
 
- troisièmement, dans les interactions entre autorités, qui doivent être 
améliorées : même s’il a été réglé de façon satisfaisante, le cas de la 
Banco Popular a également montré l’importance d’une coopération étroite 
et rapide entre les autorités de surveillance et de résolution, à la fois au 
niveau européen et au niveau national. À cet égard, il y a encore matière à 
améliorer la coordination entre les différentes autorités européennes (MSU 
et BCE, MRU, Commission et ABE) afin d’établir plus clairement qui est le 
« pilote dans l’avion » en matière de gestion de crise. Par la suite, nous 
pourrions même envisager de mettre en place une autorité bancaire unique 
pour notre Union bancaire unique, qui agirait pour renforcer la solidité du 
secteur bancaire européen.  
 
Le second défi consiste à soutenir les consolidations transfrontières des 
banques dans la zone euro. La présidente du MSU, Danièle Nouy, a 
également insisté sur ce point il y a quelques jours. À cet égard, nous 
accusons toujours un retard important par rapport au marché américain : aux 
États-Unis, la part de marché des cinq premières banques est de plus de 
40 %, alors que dans la zone euro, la part de marché des cinq premières 
banques est inférieure à 20 %. Des consolidations transfrontières saines et 
solides permettraient aux banques de mieux diversifier leurs risques dans 
l’ensemble de la zone euro et d’orienter plus efficacement l’épargne vers les 
investissements au-delà des frontières ; cela renforcerait l’Union de 
financement que j’ai évoquée précédemment.  
 
Du point de vue des autorités de surveillance, cela implique de favoriser une 
approche sur une base consolidée en accordant davantage de dérogations en 
matière de liquidité et de fonds propres, afin de permettre une allocation plus 
flexible des capitaux et de limiter le cloisonnement (ring-fencing). La rapidité 
d’exécution des transactions transfrontières est également essentielle : la mise 
en œuvre d’une procédure accélérée par le MSU permettrait de régler cette 
Page 10 sur 10 
 
question. Du point de vue de la résolution, les exigences internes de MREL 
pourraient constituer un outil pour faciliter la résolution des institutions, mais 
elles perdraient leur sens si elles étaient calculées sur une base nationale. En 
effet, l’existence de MREL internes dans tous les pays pourrait constituer un 
obstacle au marché unique et aux fusions transfrontières entre banques 
européennes. Enfin, nous devons lever les obstacles économiques et 
juridiques aux fusions transfrontières : l’asymétrie d’information, les créances 
douteuses et les structures juridiques anti-OPA dans différents pays. En tant 
que première étape concrète, je propose que l’Autorité bancaire européenne 
publie un recensement exhaustif de l’ensemble des obstacles aux activités et 
aux fusions transfrontières qui découlent de la réglementation et de la 
supervision. L’objectif est limpide : au sein d’une Union monétaire et bancaire, 
une fusion transfrontière ne doit pas poser plus de difficultés et de 
complications qu’une fusion « domestique ». La logique de l’union bancaire est 
qu’elle doit être considérée, à des fins bancaires, comme une juridiction 
unique. 
** 
Je voudrais conclure par une citation d’un des pères fondateurs de l’Europe. 
Le 10 décembre 1951, Robert Schuman a déclaré devant l’Assemblée du 
Conseil de l’Europe : « Faute de nous décider à temps, Mesdames, 
Messieurs, nous risquons de manquer pour l’Europe et pour nos pays la 
dernière chance de salut ». Dans le contexte de l’après-guerre, il était bien 
conscient de la nécessité urgente d’agir en Europe. Dans le contexte actuel, 
nous devrions profiter de ce sentiment d’opportunité unique. Il existe bien 
entendu des projets qui ne sont pas économiques : par exemple, le défi du 
changement climatique, l’éducation et la formation des jeunes – à cet égard, 
un programme Erasmus Pro doit être une priorité pour les jeunes non qualifiés 
et sans emploi. Mais dans le domaine économique qui est l’objet de mon 
propos aujourd’hui, c’est maintenant ou jamais : le moment est venu 
d’accélérer le mouvement en Europe. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un plaisir pour moi d’être à Amsterdam aujourd’hui et de prononcer le 
discours introductif de votre Assemblée générale annuelle. Je tiens à 
remercier chaleureusement mon ami le gouverneur Klaas Knot et Leonique 
van Houwelingen, présidente de l’Association des banques étrangères, pour 
leur aimable invitation. Pour un banquier central, Amsterdam est un lieu d’une 
importance particulière : en effet, la Banque d’Amsterdam – en néerlandais 
Amsterdamsche Wisselbank – fondée dès 1609, peut être considérée comme 
un précurseur des banques centrales, avant que son rôle ne soit repris par la 
Nederlandsche Bank, qui est également une vénérable institution puisqu’elle a 
été créée par le roi Guillaume I
er
 en 1814. De plus, Amsterdam est depuis 
longtemps une capitale économique et financière et une ville importante au 
cœur de l’Europe. Si j’ajoute votre tradition de liberté et de tolérance, votre 
pays est un parangon de nombre des vertus européennes qui nous sont 
chères 
Cet après-midi, j’aimerais, en tant que banquier central, partager avec vous 
certaines réflexions sur une question qui est tout à fait d’actualité : l’avenir de 
l’Europe. Votre nouveau ministre des Affaires étrangères, Halbe Zijlstra, a 
prononcé un discours sur ce thème la semaine dernière et a plaidé à juste titre 
en faveur d’« une Europe pertinente pour les Européens [et] qui soit de 
nouveau synonyme de prospérité et de croissance ». Ce sujet est également 
d’actualité parce que le moment est venu d’accélérer le mouvement en 
Europe. En effet, nous avons clairement réussi à construire une Union 
monétaire, mais ce n’est pas suffisant. Il est urgent de réaliser des progrès 
concrets en matière d’Union économique, pour laquelle nous n’avons pas 
atteint nos objectifs. Nous vivons une période d’opportunité historique unique : 
tout d’abord, le contexte économique est actuellement favorable à une 
avancée, puisque la croissance de la zone euro devrait atteindre au moins 
2,2 % en 2017 ; « c’est lorsque le soleil brille qu’il faut réparer le toit ». 
 
2 
 
Ensuite, après les élections récentes en France, en Allemagne et aux 
Pays-Bas, nous avons un « alignement démocratique » en termes de 
calendrier et probablement sur le fond, pour les quatre années à venir. Enfin, 
le vote du Brexit et l’élection de M. Trump aux États-Unis ont apporté des 
stimuli externes, démontrant l’importance d’insuffler une vie nouvelle à 
l’intégration européenne afin que nous, Européens, prenions notre destin entre 
nos mains, comme la chancelière Merkel l’a dit à juste titre à Munich au 
printemps dernier. Aujourd’hui, je vais explorer trois cercles économiques 
concentriques : premièrement, l’Union économique, en présentant les 
accélérateurs nécessaires pour réaliser des progrès concrets ; deuxièmement, 
l’Union de financement, en m’attachant à un de ces accélérateurs, susceptible 
de présenter un intérêt particulier pour votre communauté de banques et 
d’institutions financières ; et troisièmement, l’Union bancaire, qui constitue une 
partie essentielle de l’Union de financement et qui doit être achevée.  
 
I. Le moment est venu d’agir en Europe : quatre accélérateurs de 
l’Union économique 
À Rome, le 25 mars dernier, les États membres ont tous clairement souhaité 
travailler « en vue de l’achèvement de l’Union économique et monétaire ». 
Nous sommes d’accord sur le « pourquoi ». Permettez-moi de dire un mot sur 
notre politique monétaire. En tenant compte des progrès réalisés, le Conseil 
des gouverneurs a décidé fin octobre de poursuivre une normalisation 
progressive. Nous suivrons clairement cette trajectoire de normalisation 
progressive, avec prudence mais en combinant toute la gamme de nos 
instruments – et il ne faut pas mettre l’accent de manière excessive sur les 
achats nets d’actifs. Mais la politique monétaire ne peut pas tout faire et nous 
ne devons donc pas la surcharger. En outre, nous visons plus de stabilité, 
face au risque d’une prochaine crise qui trouverait la zone euro démunie, avec 
toutes ses répercussions politiques et économiques dommageables, et plus 
 
3 
 
de croissance, pour combler notre retard passé par rapport aux États-Unis et 
traiter enfin la maladie mortelle du chômage de masse en Europe.  
En ayant cet objectif présent à l’esprit, comment pouvons-nous avancer, 
concrètement, sur l’Union économique ? Selon moi, il nous faut activer quatre 
accélérateurs : un accélérateur macro, qui consisterait en une stratégie 
économique collective partagée par l’ensemble des États membres de la zone 
euro ; un accélérateur micro, sous la forme d’une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation, qui irait plus loin que l’Union des marchés de 
capitaux ; un accélérateur budgétaire, qui s’appuierait sur un budget de la 
zone euro. Le quatrième accélérateur n’est pas sur le fond, mais serait plutôt 
un « facilitateur » des trois premiers : en termes d’institutions, nous aurions 
besoin d’un ministre des Finances et d’un Parlement pour la zone euro.  
Ces quatre accélérateurs sont nécessaires, mais cela ne signifie pas qu’ils 
doivent tous être mis en œuvre en même temps. Avec le Traité existant, nous 
pouvons prendre immédiatement des mesures concernant les deux premiers 
accélérateurs, à savoir macro et micro, sur lesquels j’insisterai aujourd’hui.  
L’accélérateur macro consiste en une stratégie économique collective au 
sein de la zone euro. Il repose sur un constat simple : la croissance 
économique et l’emploi seraient plus élevés dans la zone euro si nous 
combinions davantage de réformes structurelles dans les pays où elles sont 
nécessaires, comme la France ou l’Italie, et davantage de relance dans les 
pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre, comme l’Allemagne ou les Pays-
Bas. Pour y parvenir, les États membres de la zone euro doivent sceller un 
accord, qui pourrait être préparé et adopté dès 2018.  
Les réformes nationales constituent évidemment une condition préalable à 
tout renforcement de l’Union économique. Je profite de l’occasion pour saluer 
la réussite des réformes entreprises aux Pays-Bas ces dernières années, 
notamment sur le marché du travail. Le PIB en volume devrait augmenter ici 
de 3,2 % en 2017 et le taux de chômage devrait s’établir à 4,8 % en 2017, 
proche du plein emploi.  
 
4 
 
L’accélération des réformes est désormais une priorité en France également, 
autour de deux grands axes : d’une part, le rétablissement durable de nos 
finances publiques, et d’autre part, une ambition de transformation 
économique structurelle, avec un important effort de simplification sur le 
marché du travail, et un investissement massif dans l’éducation, la formation 
professionnelle et l’apprentissage. Le nouveau gouvernement, sous la 
présidence de M. Macron, a pris des mesures décisives dans cette direction 
avec la réforme du marché du travail votée cet été et déjà mise en œuvre, et 
la réforme de l’assurance chômage, de la formation professionnelle et de 
l’apprentissage pour l’année prochaine. Dans le même temps, des mesures 
ont été prises pour réduire la charge fiscale pesant sur les investissements. En 
outre, des décisions ont été prises pour réduire le déficit public. Pour la 
première fois depuis 10 ans, le déficit public devrait être inférieur au seuil de 
3 % du PIB en 2017 (2,9 %).  
 
II. L’accélérateur micro : une Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation 
Je voudrais maintenant vous parler de l’accélérateur micro pour l’Union 
économique, qui est le deuxième cercle concentrique. Cet accélérateur micro 
prendrait la forme de ce que j’appelle une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation ». La zone euro connaît un excédent 
d’épargne par rapport à l’investissement de 350 milliards d’euros environ par 
an, soit plus de 3 % du PIB. L’objectif de cette Union de financement est de 
mieux orienter cette épargne vers l’investissement productif, notamment en 
faveur des fonds propres qui sont la clé d’une économie de l’innovation.  
Plusieurs initiatives clés contribuent à cette Union de financement et existent 
déjà : i) l’Union des marchés de capitaux, qui favorise la diversification du 
financement privé ; ii) le plan d’investissement Juncker, qui oriente 
l’investissement public et privé vers l’économie réelle ; et iii) l’Union bancaire, 
qui vise à résoudre la fragmentation financière persistante. Cependant, ces 
 
5 
 
initiatives souffrent de l’absence d’une gouvernance unifiée par une Union de 
financement, qui permettrait de contourner les obstacles bureaucratiques et de 
renforcer les synergies.   
Par ailleurs, les progrès vers une Union de financement sont encore 
nécessaires dans quatre domaines clés :  
- premièrement, en incitant aux investissements transfrontières – 
essentiellement en fonds propres – par le biais des règles comptables, de 
la fiscalité et des lois de faillite. Le renforcement de la libre circulation des 
capitaux au sein de l’UE nécessite de surmonter de nombreux obstacles 
juridiques. Nous devons améliorer la prévisibilité des cadres de faillite, 
éliminer les biais liés à la fiscalité qui pénalisent les fonds propres et 
harmoniser les règles comptables s’appliquant aux petites entreprises.  
- deuxièmement, en développant à l’échelle européenne des produits 
d’épargne davantage orientés vers les investissements à long terme. Cela 
pourrait être réalisé par le biais de différents véhicules d’épargne : la 
création de fonds de capital-risque européens, de nouvelles initiatives de 
marché en matière d’obligations vertes, des portefeuilles titrisés diversifiés 
entre les États membres, et ainsi de suite.  
- troisièmement, en achevant l’Union bancaire ;  
- quatrièmement, en contrôlant les activités financières et les risques dont 
l’importance est vitale pour la zone euro, comme les contreparties centrales 
super-systémiques.  
Il est nécessaire de réaliser des améliorations dans ces quatre domaines afin 
d’obtenir des gains significatifs pour la digitalisation, le développement des 
PME ou la transition énergétique. Dans chacun de ces domaines, nous avons 
besoin d’investissements importants.  
 
 
 
6 
 
III. Dans le cadre de l’Union de financement, achever l’Union bancaire 
Permettez-moi à présent de m’arrêter quelques instants sur le troisième 
domaine dans lequel des progrès sont nécessaires et qui est également mon 
troisième cercle concentrique : l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire. L’Union 
bancaire, qui constitue une avancée majeure pour la zone euro, est désormais 
opérationnelle, sur la base d’une règlementation uniforme (single rulebook) et 
de deux piliers – déjà – en place : le mécanisme de surveillance unique (MSU) 
depuis fin 2014 et le mécanisme de résolution unique (MRU), depuis 
début 2016. Ces deux piliers devront être complétés par un troisième pilier 
relatif à la garantie des dépôts, pour lequel nous pourrions trouver des 
compromis pratiques et raisonnables. Mais il existe deux défis 
supplémentaires qui sont moins souvent mentionnés : la cohérence et les 
consolidations.  
Pour achever l’Union bancaire, le premier défi consiste à parvenir à une 
meilleure cohérence entre réglementation, supervision et résolution, à 
trois niveaux :  
- premièrement, dans les mécanismes concrets : la finalisation et la 
simplification du pilier « résolution » devraient être une priorité. Le cas des 
banques italiennes a illustré à quel point il était complexe de combiner le 
régime de résolution établi par la directive sur le redressement et la 
résolution des défaillances bancaires (BRRD), et le cadre des aides d’État 
visant à une liquidation ordonnée. Par ailleurs, il est nécessaire de 
renforcer la confiance dans le Fonds de résolution unique (FRU) et 
d’accroître sa capacité d’intervention. La mise en place d’un filet de 
sécurité commun, mentionné dans la communication de la Commission 
européenne du 11 octobre, constitue une piste prometteuse, qui pourrait 
prendre la forme d’une ligne de crédit accordée par le MES. Par ailleurs, la 
question de la liquidité des entités ayant récemment fait l’objet d’une 
résolution (essentiellement les « banques saines ») n’est pas traitée de 
façon suffisamment claire : il est important de clarifier le soutien en liquidité 
 
7 
 
qui peut être apporté par des sources publiques, au-delà de celui qui peut 
être légitimement attendu de l’Eurosystème. 
- deuxièmement, la cohérence du cadre et des exigences juridiques : 
confrontés à l’accumulation d’exigences nouvelles et « séparées », nous 
devons adopter une approche globale et cohérente afin d’éviter une 
surcharge prudentielle. En particulier, l’exigence en matière de capacité 
totale d’absorption des pertes (TLAC) résultant du nouveau cadre 
international nécessite au niveau européen une adaptation cohérente de 
l’exigence minimale pour les fonds propres et les engagements éligibles 
(MREL). De la même façon, les conséquences du paquet de réformes de 
Bâle III, quand il sera approuvé, doivent être attentivement prises en 
compte, car il entraînerait une augmentation des actifs pondérés des 
risques, ce qui aurait par ricochet un impact sur le MREL. Toutes ces 
évolutions, conjuguées aux exigences de fonds propres au titre du Pilier II, 
pourraient entraîner une surcalibration : chaque décision individuelle est 
peut-être nécessaire, mais pas nécessairement leur accumulation un peu 
désordonnée. Et nous ne devons évidemment pas porter atteinte à l’égalité 
de traitement entre les banques de la zone euro et leurs concurrentes du 
reste du monde. 
- troisièmement, dans les interactions entre autorités, qui doivent être 
améliorées : même s’il a été réglé de façon satisfaisante, le cas de la 
Banco Popular en Espagne a également montré l’importance d’une 
coopération étroite et rapide entre les autorités de surveillance et de 
résolution, à la fois au niveau européen et au niveau national. À cet égard, 
il y a encore matière à améliorer la coordination entre les différentes 
autorités européennes (MSU et BCE, MRU, Commission et ABE) afin 
d’établir plus clairement qui est le « pilote dans l’avion » en matière de 
gestion de crise. Par la suite, nous devrions même envisager de mettre en 
place une autorité bancaire unique pour notre Union bancaire unique, qui 
agirait pour renforcer la solidité du secteur bancaire européen.  
 
8 
 
Le second défi consiste à soutenir les consolidations transfrontières des 
banques dans la zone euro. En tant que banquiers « étrangers » aux 
Pays-Bas, vous êtes probablement particulièrement sensibles à cet aspect. La 
présidente du MSU, Danièle Nouy, a également insisté sur ce point il y a 
quelques jours. À cet égard, nous accusons toujours un retard important par 
rapport au marché américain : aux États-Unis, la part de marché des cinq 
premières banques est de plus de 40 %, alors que dans la zone euro, la part 
de marché des cinq premières banques est inférieure à 20 %. Des 
consolidations transfrontières saines et solides permettraient aux banques de 
mieux diversifier leurs risques dans l’ensemble de la zone euro et d’orienter 
plus efficacement l’épargne vers les investissements au-delà des frontières ; 
cela renforcerait l’Union de financement que j’ai évoquée précédemment. 
Du point de vue des autorités de surveillance, cela implique de favoriser une 
approche sur une base consolidée en accordant davantage de dérogations en 
matière de liquidité et de fonds propres, afin de permettre une allocation plus 
flexible des capitaux et de limiter le cloisonnement (ring-fencing). La rapidité 
d’exécution des transactions transfrontières est également essentielle : la mise 
en œuvre d’une procédure accélérée par le MSU permettrait de régler cette 
question. Du point de vue de la résolution, les exigences internes de MREL 
pourraient constituer un outil pour faciliter la résolution des institutions, mais 
elles perdraient leur sens si elles étaient calculées sur une base nationale. En 
effet, l’existence de MREL internes dans tous les pays pourrait constituer un 
obstacle au marché unique et aux fusions transfrontières entre banques 
européennes. Enfin, nous devons lever les obstacles économiques et 
juridiques aux fusions transfrontières : l’asymétrie d’information, les créances 
douteuses et les structures juridiques anti-OPA dans différents pays. En tant 
que première étape concrète, je propose que l’Autorité bancaire européenne 
publie un recensement exhaustif de l’ensemble des obstacles aux activités et 
aux fusions transfrontières qui découlent de la réglementation et de la 
supervision. L’objectif est limpide : au sein d’une Union monétaire et bancaire, 
une fusion transfrontière ne doit pas poser plus de difficultés et de 
 
9 
 
complications qu’une fusion « domestique ». La logique de l’Union bancaire 
est qu’elle doit être considérée, à des fins bancaires, comme une juridiction 
unique. 
Avant de conclure, j’aimerais ajouter quelques mots sur la réglementation 
financière. Personne, je l’espère, ne peut contester sérieusement le fait 
qu’après la crise financière, il était nécessaire de renforcer significativement la 
réglementation pour réduire les risques. Est-il besoin de rappeler les 
conséquences désastreuses de cette crise sur l’économie réelle, les drames 
sociaux et la fragmentation démocratique avec la montée du populisme ? La 
stabilité financière est un bien commun qui doit être garanti. Des avancées 
remarquables ont été obtenues depuis 2009 sous l’impulsion du G20 et du 
Conseil de stabilité financière. Pour les banques, en particulier, l’essentiel des 
travaux de Bâle III, disons 80 %, a déjà été fait en 2010-2011. Toutefois, des 
discussions sont toujours en cours sur la question de la mesure du risque 
dans les bilans des banques. Il est dans l’intérêt stratégique de la France et de 
l’Europe, qui s’est toujours prononcée en faveur de règles internationales, de 
conclure un accord final sur Bâle III. Nous travaillons activement pour parvenir 
à un accord équitable et raisonnable.  
Mais au-delà de Bâle III, nous devons finaliser des mesures destinées aux 
non-banques. Nous devons assurer un équilibre entre les canaux de 
financement. La priorité s’est à présent reportée de la solvabilité des banques, 
qui s’est nettement améliorée, vers la liquidité du secteur bancaire parallèle, 
notamment les fonds et sociétés de gestion de portefeuille qui sont exposés à 
des risques de retraits massifs soudains sous l’effet de la panique.  
** 
Permettez-moi de conclure mon propos en citant un philosophe français, qui a 
passé de nombreuses années aux Pays-Bas : René Descartes. Il était à la fois 
le père de l’esprit cartésien - avoir une vision claire de ses objectifs - et un 
pragmatiste, avec ce principe utile : « diviser chacune des difficultés que 
j’examinerais en autant de parcelles qu’il se pourrait et qu’il serait requis pour 
 
10 
 
mieux les résoudre »
1
. En effet, nous ne devons pas nous enliser dans les 
malentendus, les débats stériles et les questions de méthode, 
intergouvernementale ou communautaire. Mais pour avancer, nous devons 
combiner une vision holistique et une approche progressive de la mise en 
œuvre. C’est ce que je me suis efforcé de faire dans mon discours 
aujourd’hui : j’ai identifié les domaines dans lesquels des progrès concrets 
peuvent être réalisés rapidement. Nous ne devons pas laisser échapper cette 
occasion historique : c’est maintenant ou jamais. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Mesdames, Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être à Francfort aujourd’hui à l’occasion de la 7
e
 conférence annuelle de 
l’AEAPP et je tiens à remercier chaleureusement le président de l’AEAPP, Gabriel 
Bernardino, pour son aimable invitation. Je dois dire que je me sens comme chez moi, car 
nous sommes tout près des locaux de la BCE où je prends part aux réunions du Conseil des 
gouverneurs au moins tous les quinze jours. Mais aujourd’hui je m’exprimerai en tant que 
président de l’autorité française de supervision (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de 
résolution - ACPR), qui fait partie du conseil des autorités de surveillance de l’AEAPP et qui 
est chargée de la supervision des sociétés d’assurance et des banques en France. C’est une 
responsabilité importante, le marché français de l’assurance étant le deuxième marché de 
l’Union européenne, juste derrière le Royaume-Uni, avec un bilan agrégé de 2 600 milliards 
d’euros environ.  
Étant donné que j’interviens juste avant le panel consacré à l’innovation, je saisirai cette 
opportunité pour mettre l’accent sur trois types d’innovation, qui à mon avis pourraient nous 
amener à repenser l’assurance et les pensions : l’innovation institutionnelle, l’innovation 
économique et l’innovation technologique. 
** 
I. L’innovation institutionnelle 
Je commencerai par l’innovation institutionnelle. Sur ce sujet, je tiens en premier lieu à 
rendre hommage à l’AEAPP qui, depuis sa création en janvier 2011, a fait un travail 
remarquable pour promouvoir une réglementation européenne solide et cohérente et des 
pratiques de supervision harmonisées au sein de l’Union européenne. La création de 
l’AEAPP, à la suite du rapport Larosière, traduisait la nécessité d’avancer vers une 
supervision plus intégrée au niveau européen après la crise financière de 2007-2008 et je 
crois que c’est une réussite. Dans un contexte d’intégration croissante des marchés 
financiers, l’AEAPP a contribué à garantir une véritable égalité de traitement à l’ensemble 
des acteurs du secteur de l’assurance et des pensions professionnelles au niveau européen, 
en coordination avec les autorités nationales et les autres autorités européennes de 
surveillance (AES). Ce cadre de supervision équilibré nous permet de gérer l’innovation 
« institutionnelle » – c’est là mon premier point – que nous commençons à voir apparaître en 
conséquence du vote en faveur du Brexit. Certaines entités britanniques envisagent en effet 
la possibilité de ne constituer que des coquilles vides dans l’Union européenne, des 
« plaques de cuivre », tout en gardant leurs ressources au Royaume-Uni. Je souscris ici 
totalement à la vigilance souhaitée par l’AEAPP sur ce sujet. En outre, le Brexit est associé à 
certains risques, d’où la nécessité de plans de contingence. Je pense notamment aux 
 
2 
 
assurés européens ayant souscrit directement auprès d’organismes britanniques et qui 
devraient continuer à bénéficier de la même protection. L’AEAPP, en liaison avec les 
autorités britanniques, a fort justement attiré l’attention des organismes d’assurance 
britanniques sur la nécessité d’élaborer des plans visant à gérer le Brexit, indépendamment 
des négociations toujours en cours. Il est particulièrement important de garantir que le Brexit 
se passe le mieux possible, avec des effets limités pour les assurés.  
À l’avenir toutefois, il conviendrait d’envisager un ajustement du cadre institutionnel 
européen, afin qu’il reste aussi efficace que possible. La revue des AES devrait nous inciter 
à renforcer les missions de l’AEAPP. Il y a deux domaines en particulier où un renforcement 
de la convergence est nécessaire, afin que tous les consommateurs européens soient 
protégés quelle que soit la localisation de l’organisme d’assurance dans l’Union 
européenne : l’assurance en responsabilité civile dans la construction et dans les services 
médicaux. L’AEAPP a déjà lancé des plates-formes de coopération afin de faciliter les 
échanges d’informations concernant l’assurance en responsabilité civile dans la construction. 
Nous sommes très favorables à la poursuite de ces initiatives et à l’adoption de mesures 
visant à harmoniser les pratiques de supervision à cet égard. Dans le même temps, nous 
devrions maintenir une distinction claire entre la surveillance prudentielle au quotidien 
confiée aux autorités nationales compétentes (ANC) et le rôle d’harmonisation réglementaire 
qui doit être joué par l’AEAPP. Conformément à ce principe, par exemple, il serait préférable 
que la validation des modèles internes reste de la responsabilité des ANC afin de refléter le 
lien étroit entre ces décisions et le dialogue permanent entre l’organisme d’assurance et son 
superviseur national ; l’AEAPP, pour sa part, pourrait se concentrer plus efficacement sur la 
mission essentielle que représente le renforcement de l’harmonisation des pratiques 
nationales.  
Au-delà de ces ajustements souhaitables du cadre institutionnel européen, il convient de 
réaliser des progrès concrets vers un mécanisme de résolution européen, qui fournirait 
des outils plus adaptés afin de limiter l’impact de la faillite d’un organisme d’assurance et 
d’accroître la confiance. La France a œuvré en ce sens au niveau national et un tel 
mécanisme sera en place dans notre pays avant décembre
i
. Le régime français de résolution 
dans le secteur de l’assurance requiert des organismes d’assurance d’une certaine taille 
qu’ils élaborent des plans de redressement préventifs, qui constitueront la base des plans de 
résolution préventifs. De plus, l’ACPR s’est vu confier plusieurs pouvoirs à utiliser dans un 
contexte de résolution, comme la possibilité de nommer un administrateur chargé de la 
résolution dans l’organisme d’assurance, de limiter la distribution de dividendes ou 
d’organiser des transferts de portefeuilles à un autre organisme d’assurance.

II. L’innovation économique 
Je vais maintenant aborder mon deuxième point : l’innovation économique. L’économie de 
l’Europe étant proche de la « frontière technologique », il est nécessaire que les entreprises 
innovent davantage. Pour ce faire, elles doivent être capables de prendre davantage de 
risques, ce qui nécessite plus de financement par fonds propres, sur le long terme, plutôt 
que du financement par la dette. À cet égard, la zone euro est très en retard : les fonds 
propres représentaient seulement 68 % du PIB fin 2016, contre 128 % aux États-Unis. Et 
pourtant, les ressources sont abondantes : l’excédent d’épargne par rapport à 
l’investissement est de 350 milliards d’euros environ par an, soit plus de 3 % du PIB. Il est 
donc essentiel pour l’économie de la zone euro de mieux orienter cette épargne vers 
l’investissement productif au-delà des frontières, notamment en faveur des fonds propres qui 
sont la clé d’une économie de l’innovation. Les start-ups le savent bien, mais en Europe, nos 
entreprises en croissance (scale-ups), nos entreprises de taille intermédiaire et nos PME 
doivent aussi avoir davantage accès au levier financier des actions. Le secteur de 
l’assurance a un rôle primordial à jouer, puisque c’est le principal investisseur institutionnel 
de la zone euro, avec un total d’actifs de près de 7 800 milliards d’euros au deuxième 
trimestre 2017. 
En pratique, quelle est la voie à suivre ? Une grande partie de la solution se situe au niveau 
européen. Jusqu’à présent, les efforts vont dans la bonne direction, mais les travaux doivent 
maintenant s’accélérer avec ce que j’appelle une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation ». Cette Union de financement est l’accélérateur 
microéconomique dont nous avons besoin pour réaliser des progrès concrets vers une 
véritable Union économique au sein de la zone euro. Les éléments constitutifs de cette 
Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation existent déjà : i) l’Union des 
marchés de capitaux, qui favorise la diversification du financement privé ; ii) le plan 
d’investissement Juncker, qui oriente l’investissement public et privé vers l’économie réelle ; 
et iii) l’Union bancaire, qui vise à résoudre la fragmentation financière persistante. 
Cependant, ces initiatives souffrent de l’absence d’une gouvernance unifiée par une Union 
de financement, qui permettrait de contourner les obstacles bureaucratiques et de renforcer 
les synergies. De plus, pour que cette Union financière soit effective, des progrès sont 
encore nécessaires dans quatre domaines clés : premièrement, en incitant aux 
investissements transfrontières (essentiellement en fonds propres) par le biais des règles 
comptables, de la fiscalité et des lois sur les faillites ; deuxièmement, en développant des 
produits d’épargne et des véhicules d’investissement à long terme à l’échelle européenne, 
comme les fonds de capital-risque européens – je mettrai l’accent sur cet axe de progrès qui 
revêt un intérêt particulier pour le secteur de l’assurance; troisièmement, en achevant l’Union 
 
4 
 
bancaire ; et quatrièmement, en contrôlant les activités et les risques financiers dont 
l’importance est vitale pour la zone euro, tels que les contreparties centrales super-
systémiques.  
Dans ce contexte, les assureurs ont un rôle essentiel à jouer en prenant l’initiative de 
nouvelles formes d’assurance-vie compatibles avec l’environnement de taux d’intérêt bas, 
avec le besoin de financement par fonds propres de la zone euro et avec les attentes des 
ménages de la zone – la prévoyance pour la vieillesse se situe désormais au deuxième rang 
des principaux motifs d’épargne. Cela signifie que les assureurs doivent poursuivre leur 
réflexion pour développer à l’échelle européenne de nouveaux produits d’épargne de long 
terme. Ces produits doivent bénéficier du rendement plus élevé des actions dans la durée et 
ils peuvent être moins liquides, tout en étant également assortis d’une forme de protection du 
capital. Il demeure cependant essentiel que l’innovation en matière de produits continue de 
s’effectuer avec prudence, sans nuire à la protection des assurés. À cet égard, il convient 
d’accorder une attention particulière au produit paneuropéen d’épargne-retraite individuelle 
(PEPP). Ce produit constitue une piste de développement de produits à l’échelle européenne 
et répond au besoin des assureurs de sortir du cumul garantie en liquidité et garantie en 
capital. Il soulève cependant quelques inquiétudes : l’information sur les risques encourus 
dans le cadre des différents types de garanties peut ne pas être suffisamment claire pour les 
consommateurs ; de plus, la garantie peut finalement dépendre de la société financière 
proposant ce produit, puisqu’il existe une différence, par exemple, entre les entreprises 
d’assurance respectant la directive Solvabilité II et les gestionnaires d’actifs, soumis à de 
moindres exigences en capital.  
Ceci m’amène à l’aspect réglementaire. Les assureurs doivent ici aussi jouer leur rôle, en 
contribuant activement à la revue du nouveau cadre réglementaire issu de la directive 
Solvabilité II. Sur bien des points, Solvabilité II est une avancée très importante pour le 
secteur de l’assurance. Mais cela ne signifie pas qu’elle est parfaite : nous devons analyser 
de près ses impacts, en particulier sur les comportements d’investissement et le financement 
de l’économie, pour pouvoir proposer les ajustements nécessaires. Des progrès ont d’ores et 
déjà été apportés pour le financement des projets et entreprises d’infrastructure, grâce à 
deux amendements entrés en vigueur respectivement en avril 2016 et en septembre 2017, 
qui ont adapté le calibrage des exigences en capital. Mais plus largement, les revues de la 
formule standard et des mesures du « paquet branches longues », prévues respectivement 
pour 2018 et 2020, sont des rendez-vous importants pour apporter les améliorations 
indispensables. Les travaux sont en cours et je salue la proposition publiée par l’AEAPP 
début novembre de réduire les exigences en capital pour les titres de créance non notés et 
les fonds propres non listés sous certaines conditions.  
 
5 
 
C’est la Commission qui a spécifiquement fait la demande d’examiner ces investissements 
non notés ou non listés. Mais nous pouvons souhaiter avoir une vision plus large et intégrer 
d’autres types d’investissements à long terme dans des propositions innovantes afin de 
modifier Solvabilité II, en vue de parvenir au bon équilibre entre une supervision efficace et le 
financement de l’économie réelle. Il appartient maintenant au secteur de saisir cette 
opportunité de partager ses points de vue et son expérience : la réglementation de demain 
doit bénéficier de vos idées. En ce qui concerne la question globale du calcul de la 
solvabilité, par exemple, la corrélation entre les classes d’actifs, afin de reconnaître 
pleinement les avantages en termes de diversification des investissements à long terme, 
pourrait constituer une avancée innovante. 
 
III. L’innovation technologique 
Permettez-moi d’aborder à présent mon troisième et dernier point : l’innovation 
technologique. La révolution digitale crée de nombreuses opportunités pour les acteurs 
financiers comme pour les consommateurs, avec notamment un nombre croissant de 
services financiers plus accessibles et une satisfaction des clients plus complète. En France, 
l’ACPR est mobilisée pour soutenir l’innovation, comme le montre la création du Pôle de 
l’innovation FinTech et du Forum FinTech avec l’Autorité des marchés financiers française. 
Au sein de ce forum FinTech nous travaillons en étroite collaboration avec d’autres autorités 
publiques afin de promouvoir le développement des FinTech et des InsurTech en France. Il y 
a un an, l’ACPR a autorisé la première assurance santé entièrement digitale, l’InsurTech 
« Alan ». 
Dans le cas des organismes d’assurance, la révolution digitale débute par une refonte 
complète des relations avec la clientèle et des habitudes des consommateurs. Mais elle va 
plus loin. Dans le cadre de la révolution digitale, le secteur de l’assurance peut apporter 
stabilité et protection, ce qui est la raison d’être depuis toujours de l’assurance. Je 
souhaiterais souligner deux sujets qui sont essentiels à mes yeux : la cyber-assurance et le 
big data. 
La couverture contre les cyber-risques, premièrement, est une préoccupation qui touche 
l’ensemble des entreprises, des plus petites aux plus grandes, car les cyber-attaques sont 
de plus en plus fréquentes et coûteuses : selon un rapport de Lloyd’s and Cyence, on estime 
qu’en 2016, les cyber-attaques ont coûté aux entreprises environ 450 milliards de dollars au 
niveau mondial. En dépit de ces menaces, le marché de la cyber-assurance est encore trop 
peu développé. Les organismes d’assurance peuvent et doivent s’inspirer de leur propre 
 
6 
 
expérience dans la lutte contre les cyber-risques pour faire émerger une offre européenne de 
cyber-assurance plus mature.  
Les données à caractère personnel et le Big Data sont le deuxième sujet sur lequel je 
souhaiterais mettre l’accent. Naturellement, le développement des objets connectés, qui 
démultiplient la quantité d’informations sur les assurés, est une opportunité pour le métier de 
l’assurance qui consiste précisément à collecter et exploiter des données pour mesurer un 
risque et en déduire une tarification. Néanmoins, les organismes d’assurance doivent 
adopter une approche responsable : il faut trouver un juste équilibre entre la segmentation et 
le partage du risque entre assurés. Ce sont les principes de solidarité et de mutualisation 
consubstantiels à l’assurance qui sont en jeu. Et il ne faut pas perdre de vue nos valeurs 
collectives à l’égard du respect de la vie privée.  
** 
Pour conclure, je souhaite souligner que toutes ces innovations exigent une certaine 
créativité de la part des superviseurs comme des assureurs. John Maynard Keynes, qui a 
profondément renouvelé la pensée économique, était bien conscient de la nécessité de sortir 
des sentiers battus. Dans la préface de La théorie générale, il a écrit : « La difficulté n’est 
pas de comprendre les idées nouvelles, elle est d’échapper aux idées anciennes qui ont 
poussé leurs ramifications dans tous les recoins de l’esprit des personnes ayant reçu la 
même formation que la plupart d’entre nous. »
ii
. Ayons le courage de penser différemment. À 
cet égard, en tant qu’organismes d’assurance, il vous appartient de façonner l’assurance du 
futur et, comme je l’ai dit, il y a beaucoup à faire. En tant que superviseurs, nous devons 
également faire preuve de suffisamment de souplesse pour soutenir vos innovations, tout en 
garantissant le respect des principes clés que j’ai mentionnés précédemment. Je suis très 
heureux que cette question soit développée lors de la prochaine table ronde cet après-midi. 
Je vous souhaite une réflexion très fructueuse. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être à Londres aujourd’hui et je tiens à vous remercier de m’avoir invité à 
m’exprimer lors de votre déjeuner financier annuel. Le destin de la France et celui du 
Royaume-Uni sont liés depuis très longtemps ; l’existence de la Chambre de commerce 
française en Grande-Bretagne, créée il y a 143 ans, illustre bien ces liens solides et 
durables. À cet égard, je souhaiterais vous exprimer toute notre solidarité pour les attentats 
qui ont frappé Londres récemment. En 1940, le roi Georges VI faisait une déclaration, qui 
résonne encore aujourd’hui : « Ce ne sont pas les murs qui font la ville, mais les citoyens qui 
vivent à l’intérieur. Les murs de Londres peuvent être détruits, l’esprit des Londoniens se 
maintiendra, déterminé et en rien découragé ». Je pense que l’esprit de résistance, si 
caractéristique des Londoniens, est ce dont nous avons le plus besoin en temps de crise. 
Nous sommes, et nous demeurerons toujours, des amis et partenaires proches, même si 
nous ne ferons  – malheureusement – plus partie du même Club européen une fois que le 
Brexit sera effectif. Aujourd’hui, je vais tout d’abord évoquer deux enjeux qui vont continuer à 
nous unir : la nécessité d’avoir de bonnes politiques économiques nationales, pro-business 
et orientées vers le long terme ; et la nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif face à nos défis 
globaux. J’insisterai ensuite sur un défi que nous allons devoir gérer ensemble : notre future 
relation et le Brexit.  
** 
I La nécessité d’avoir des politiques économiques nationales  
pro-business et orientées vers le long terme  
Permettez-moi de commencer par le défi des politiques économiques nationales. Dans la 
zone euro, la reprise économique est à présent solide et généralisée à travers les pays et les 
secteurs. D’après notre prévision BCE, la croissance du PIB devrait atteindre au moins 
2,2 % en 2017. La politique monétaire accommodante de la BCE a contribué à cette 
accélération de la croissance dans la zone euro. La politique monétaire ne peut cependant 
pas tout faire. Des réformes structurelles dans chaque pays et un renforcement de la 
coordination européenne sont essentiels pour renforcer la croissance potentielle à moyen 
terme et traiter la maladie mortelle du chômage de masse. Ces dernières années, plusieurs 
pays européens, y compris en Europe du Sud, ont mené avec succès des réformes de 
grande ampleur qui produisent des résultats positifs en termes de croissance et d’emploi. 
L’Allemagne, les Pays-Bas et les pays nordiques, ainsi que l’Espagne et le Portugal, sont la 
preuve que le succès économique, une monnaie unique solide et le modèle social européen 
sont compatibles. Nous devons conduire des politiques économiques pro-business, 
orientées vers le long terme et saines sur le plan budgétaire, tout en conservant les éléments 
fondamentaux d’un modèle social commun, qui peut constituer l’ADN et la fierté de l’Europe 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
dans ce monde très divisé. Le modèle social que nous partageons dans la zone euro 
combine un haut niveau de service public, des inégalités relativement faibles – nettement 
moins fortes qu’aux États-Unis – et une bonne intensité du dialogue social. Appelez cela une 
« économie sociale de marché » si vous le souhaitez, sans préjudice du débat intense et 
légitime qui a lieu aujourd’hui au sein du Royaume-Uni.  
En France, la croissance a commencé à se redresser, atteignant 0,6 % et 0,5 %, 
respectivement, au deuxième et troisième trimestres 2017. Toutefois, malgré la vigueur des 
créations d’emplois, le taux de chômage demeure élevé, à 9,4 % au troisième 
trimestre 2017. Par conséquent, l’accélération des réformes est désormais une priorité en 
France également, autour de deux grands axes : le rétablissement durable de nos finances 
publiques et une ambition de transformation économique structurelle, avec un important 
effort de simplification sur le marché du travail, et un investissement massif dans l’éducation, 
la formation professionnelle et l’apprentissage.  
Le nouveau gouvernement, sous la présidence de M. Macron, a pris des mesures décisives 
dans cette direction. Je souligne ce point en tant que banquier central indépendant. 
S’agissant des finances publiques, la France a toujours l’un des niveaux de dépenses 
publiques les plus élevés parmi les pays de l’OCDE, à 56 % du PIB en 2016. Le 
gouvernement français s’est engagé à réduire ce taux de 3 points de PIB au cours des cinq 
prochaines années. En outre, des mesures ont été prises afin de maintenir le déficit public 
en dessous du seuil de 3 % du PIB. Pour la première fois depuis 10 ans, le déficit public 
devrait être inférieur à ce seuil en 2017 (2,9 %). Il va sans dire que ces efforts doivent être 
poursuivis à l’avenir, comme l’a indiqué hier la Commission européenne, tout en 
reconnaissant les progrès réalisés en France. 
En ce qui concerne la transformation structurelle, le gouvernement a décidé d’agir 
rapidement en légiférant par décret au cours des premiers mois de son mandat. Une 
réforme du marché du travail de grande ampleur a été approuvée l’été dernier et a déjà 
été mise en application. Elle offre davantage de flexibilité aux entreprises en donnant aux 
partenaires sociaux plus de marge pour les négociations et en réduisant les incertitudes en 
matière de licenciements. De plus, des mesures ont été annoncées pour favoriser l’emploi 
en réduisant le coût du travail : la transformation du CICE (crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité 
et l’emploi) en une réduction permanente des cotisations sociales et le transfert des 
cotisations sociales finançant l’assurance santé et l’assurance chômage vers un impôt sur le 
revenu à taux unique avec une base plus large (la CSG). En outre, des mesures ont été 
prises pour réduire la charge fiscale pesant sur les investissements : la suppression de 
l’impôt sur la fortune pour tous les investissements financiers, la réduction de l’impôt sur les 
sociétés pour le ramener vers la moyenne de l’UE ou encore le taux d’imposition unique à 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
30 % sur les revenus du capital. En soutenant le financement par fonds propres, ces 
mesures devraient, je l’espère, favoriser la création et le développement des entreprises, 
notamment des PME innovantes. Des fonds seront consacrés à la formation professionnelle. 
Une réforme de la formation professionnelle et de l’apprentissage est attendue pour l’année 
prochaine. Elle est grandement nécessaire car l’économie française continue de connaître 
des pénuries de main-d’œuvre en dépit d’un chômage élevé. Ces réformes devraient avoir 
un impact  significatif sur la croissance et l’emploi à long terme.  
 
II La nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif pour relever nos défis globaux 
J’en arrive à présent au second point : la nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif pour relever 
nos défis globaux. Dans le contexte actuel, la coopération internationale entre les pays est 
peut-être plus importante que jamais. Au-delà des frontières de l’UE, et avec l’ensemble de 
nos partenaires, nous devons nous efforcer de maintenir les règles du jeu collectives afin de 
préserver l’amélioration de l’environnement économique mondial.  
En effet, la reprise mondiale s’est accélérée depuis 2016 : selon les dernières prévisions du 
FMI, la croissance mondiale devrait s’établir à 3,6 % en 2017, après 3,2 % en 2016. 
Cependant, deux risques majeurs menacent la croissance : premièrement, l’instabilité 
financière, avec la hausse continue de l’endettement mondial public et privé depuis le début 
des années 2000, qui est passé de 190 % du PIB mondial en 2001 à 230 % en 2016. C’est 
ce qui a entraîné la crise de 2008, mais cette tendance ne s’est malheureusement pas 
ralentie depuis lors ; la dette privée des pays émergents (à savoir la dette des entreprises) a 
augmenté de façon particulièrement rapide. Toute tentation d’affaiblir les réglementations 
financières mises en œuvre suite à la crise de 2008 serait donc d’autant plus inquiétante.  
Depuis les sommets du G20 de Londres et de Pittsburgh en 2009, l’effort de réglementation 
qui a été entrepris est sans précédent, notamment dans le secteur bancaire : en accroissant 
à la fois la quantité et la qualité des fonds propres de ce secteur, la réforme de Bâle III a 
considérablement renforcé la robustesse des banques ; de plus, elle permet désormais de 
mieux tenir compte des différents risques auxquels les banques sont exposées, grâce à 
l’introduction de deux nouveaux ratios de liquidité pour les niveaux de trésorerie des 
banques. Mais au-delà de Bâle III, nous devons finaliser des mesures destinées aux non-
banques. Nous devons assurer un équilibre entre les circuits de financement. La priorité 
s’est à présent reportée de la solvabilité des banques, qui s’est nettement améliorée, vers 
la liquidité du secteur bancaire parallèle, notamment les fonds et sociétés de gestion de 
portefeuille qui sont exposés à des risques de retraits massifs soudains sous l’effet de la 
panique. 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Nous devons nous assurer que ce cadre réglementaire approuvé à l’échelle internationale 
est appliqué partout de façon cohérente. Une déréglementation unilatérale ne serait rien 
d’autre qu’un scénario perdant-perdant, qui entraînerait de graves conséquences pour la 
stabilité du système financier mondial – en ouvrant la voie à la prochaine crise financière – et 
pour l’environnement concurrentiel des banques américaines, britanniques et européennes. 
Comme Mark Carney, gouverneur de la Banque d’Angleterre et président du Conseil de 
stabilité financière, l’a fait valoir en avril à Washington, nous avons besoin de « la 
combinaison de normes internationales robustes et d’une confiance accrue, découlant d’une 
mise en œuvre transparente et d’une coopération intensive en matière de supervision ».  
Le second risque est lié aux tendances protectionnistes des États-Unis depuis l’élection de 
leur président. Nous, les Européens, main dans la main avec le Canada, le Japon et d’autres 
pays ailleurs dans le monde, devons résolument défendre les relations économiques 
internationales basées sur des règles et des institutions multilatérales respectées de tous : 
leur dégradation freinerait les échanges et l’activité économique à l’échelle mondiale. 
 
 
III Notre relation future et le Brexit 
Il nous faudra néanmoins relever ensemble un défi évident : celui de nos relations futures à 
la lumière du Brexit. Il y a un an et demi, le peuple britannique a fait le choix de quitter 
l’Union européenne et, même si nous regrettons ce choix, nous respectons cette décision 
démocratique. Nous devons maintenant travailler à réduire l’incertitude et l’impact négatif 
qu’elle pourrait avoir pour le Royaume-Uni et, quoique dans une moindre mesure, pour 
l’Union européenne. La Banque de France n’est pas directement impliquée dans les 
négociations sur le Brexit ; cette question est du ressort des gouvernements et de la 
Commission européenne et, plus précisément, de Michel Barnier, qui fait preuve d’un 
engagement impressionnant dans la conduite de sa mission. Je souhaite sincèrement que 
nous puissions parvenir à un accord constructif. Soyons très clair : personne ne souhaite 
punir le Royaume-Uni, en aucune manière que ce soit, et nous espérons réellement que le 
Royaume-Uni restera un partenaire privilégié. 
Mais préserver les intérêts de l’UE, de ses citoyens, de ses entreprises, de ses États 
membres, signifie que l’accord avec le Royaume-Uni ne devra pas saper ce que nous 
sommes parvenus à accomplir en Europe dans le domaine économique : notre marché 
unique constitue l’un de nos atouts les plus importants ; il supprime toutes les frontières 
intérieures et les obstacles à la libre circulation des biens, des capitaux, des services et des 
personnes dans l’Union européenne. Au nom de la cohérence, il y a un principe en 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
particulier auquel nous devons nous attacher dans la préparation de l’accord entre l’UE et le 
Royaume-Uni : l’impossibilité de séparer l’accès au marché unique des règles qui le 
régissent. Pour le secteur des services financiers, cela signifie que l’on peut difficilement 
s’attendre à obtenir un passeport européen si l’on n’accepte pas les règles du marché 
unique.  
Londres est et restera un centre financier d’envergure mondiale, mais l’architecture du 
système financier européen pourrait être contrainte d’évoluer à cet égard. Nous ne pouvons 
pas préjuger des résultats des négociations, qui je l’espère, seront dans l’intérêt des deux 
parties, mais tous les acteurs devraient, à compter de maintenant, entreprendre tous les 
préparatifs nécessaires pour éviter le risque de se retrouver pris de cours. Londres 
continuera, et mérite sans doute de continuer à attirer et transformer l’épargne du monde 
entier. À cet égard, sur une note plus personnelle, permettez-moi de commenter ce que j’ai 
lu avec surprise dans certains journaux britanniques en juillet dernier : je n’ai jamais 
rencontré personnellement le représentant spécial de la City auprès de l’UE, M. Browne, la 
Banque de France n’a jamais souhaité que le Brexit soit préjudiciable à la City de Londres et 
nous avons des contacts fréquents et amicaux avec la City of London Corporation.  
Mais, outre l’épargne en provenance du reste du monde, l’épargne des 27 États membres de 
l’UE sera de plus en plus gérée au sein du marché unique, en raison de sa taille importante 
et de la sûreté de sa réglementation. Cela signifie que nous nous dirigerons vers un certain 
degré d’ « européanisation » pour les banques opérant sur le marché de gros, les assureurs 
et les gestionnaires d’actifs.  
Symétriquement, l’Europe et ses pays membres ont le devoir d’être favorables aux 
entreprises (business-friendly) et attractifs pour le secteur financier. Pour y parvenir, nous ne 
devons pas baisser nos exigences en matière de réglementation commune : le MSU, 
l’AEAPP et l’AEMF sont dûment mobilisés pour éviter que certaines entités qui conservent 
leurs ressources en dehors de l’UE ne constituent des coquilles vides en Europe, de simples 
« plaques de cuivre », afin de bénéficier du passeport européen. Nous devons plutôt nous 
rendre attractifs en offrant un cadre stable et favorable aux investisseurs, y compris dans les 
infrastructures, la qualification de la main d’œuvre, la législation du travail et la fiscalité. Il 
existe une émulation juste et positive à cet égard. Dans ce nouvel environnement, la place 
financière de Paris a des atouts évidents, qui s’ajoutent aux mesures très favorables 
annoncées en juillet par notre Premier ministre afin de renforcer l’attractivité de Paris. Pour 
en citer quelques-uns, la France possède les plus grandes banques d’investissement 
d’Europe continentale, le secteur de gestion d’actifs le plus important et elle est le premier 
investisseur en fonds de capital-investissement ; les universités françaises sont réputées 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
dans le monde entier pour l’excellence de leur enseignement en finance. Enfin, et surtout, 
Paris aura le privilège d’accueillir l’Autorité bancaire européenne (ABE). 
De plus, la zone euro doit garder le contrôle des risques relatifs à sa monnaie, l’euro, et aux 
transactions recourant à l’euro. Certaines infrastructures des marchés financiers situées à 
Londres, qui sont essentielles pour l’UE, deviendront bientôt extérieures à l’UE en raison du 
Brexit. Cette situation est particulièrement problématique lorsque ces infrastructures sont 
susceptibles de mettre la stabilité financière de l’UE en danger, dans la mesure où elles 
représentent 70 % des activités quotidiennes de compensation en euros, soit l’équivalent 
de 930 000 milliards d’euros (792 000 milliards de livres) en transactions par jour i. C’est la 
raison pour laquelle la Commission a proposé, ce que nous soutenons, une politique de 
localisation des contreparties centrales. Les activités de compensation en euros, pour toutes 
celles d’importance « super-systémique », doivent être localisées là où la supervision de 
l’Eurosystème peut être efficacement exercée. C’est une question de cohérence pour la 
politique monétaire et la stabilité financière.  
** 
En conclusion, permettez-moi de citer une phrase attribuée à un grand homme politique 
britannique, Benjamin Disraeli : « Les circonstances échappent au contrôle humain, mais 
notre conduite est en notre pouvoir ». Nous traversons en effet une période difficile, qui met 
à l’épreuve l’amitié entre nos deux pays. Mais nous devons y faire face ensemble. Notre 
objectif devrait être de parvenir à un accord durable et cohérent permettant à nos pays de 
demeurer étroitement liés l’un à l’autre dans le futur. Je crois que c’est notre souhait et notre 
intérêt communs. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
La stabilité des prix et la prévention des déséquilibres financiers sont souvent les deux faces 
d’une même médaille. En effet, la stabilité des prix et la stabilité financière sont censées être 
complémentaires et mutuellement bénéfiques. Durant la crise récente de la zone euro, le 
mécanisme de transmission de la politique monétaire a été entravé par la fragmentation du 
marché interbancaire, les conditions de financement se détériorant dans les pays en 
difficulté. La détérioration de l’économie qui a suivi a contribué à une nouvelle aggravation 
des tensions financières, ce que nous appelons une « boucle de rétroaction négative des 
sphères réelle et financière ». 
 
Les instances dirigeantes de la zone euro ont apporté une double réponse à cette situation 
difficile. Premièrement, nous avons adopté une politique monétaire active et lancé des 
mesures non conventionnelles, notamment le programme d’assouplissement du crédit. 
Deuxièmement, nous avons créé une Union Bancaire et attribué de nouvelles compétences 
et de nouvelles missions macroprudentielles tant au niveau européen (la BCE, le CERS) 
qu’au niveau national. En France, le Haut Conseil de stabilité financière, créé en juillet 2013 
est l’autorité française juridiquement habilitée à imposer des mesures macroprudentielles 
contraignantes. 
 
La reprise économique est en cours : le remède semble donc avoir été efficace. Cependant, 
notre attention se tourne désormais vers les potentiels effets secondaires de notre 
traitement. La politique monétaire dans la zone euro maintient les taux d’intérêt nominaux à 
court terme à des niveaux très bas, et, via notre forward guidance, ce très bas niveau 
s’étend également jusqu’au moyen terme. Toutefois, en raison du redressement de 
l’économie et des progrès réalisés vers notre cible d’inflation, le Conseil des gouverneurs a 
clairement décidé, le 26 octobre, de poursuivre la normalisation progressive de notre 
politique monétaire. Nous continuerons dans cette voie, mais les inquiétudes relatives à la 
stabilité financière pourraient s’intensifier. Il a récemment été avancé que notre politique 
pourrait entraîner des effets secondaires indésirables en termes de distorsions des prix des 
actifs ou attiser une quête de rendement qui impliquerait une prise de risque excessive.  
 
La question des effets secondaires de la politique monétaire n’est pas tout à fait nouvelle. La 
politique monétaire n’est jamais neutre dans la mesure où elle agit sur l’économie réelle via 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
ses effets sur les conditions financières, c’est-à-dire sur le coût actuel et attendu de 
l’emprunt de liquidité, et ainsi sur les prix des actifs et les primes de risque, même dans des 
circonstances normales. J’aimerais tout d’abord dire quelques mots sur la rentabilité des 
banques, qui n’est pas le seul élément de la stabilité financière (1). J’analyserai ensuite le 
prix des actifs et le cycle financier (2), avant de m’intéresser à la relation entre politique 
monétaire et politique macroprudentielle du point de vue des décideurs (3). Enfin, j’évoquerai 
la façon dont nous devrions finaliser les réglementations financières (4). 
** 
1 – Je commencerai par la rentabilité des banques. 
Il est vrai que la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt peut affecter les marges d’intérêts des banques 
car elles ne peuvent généralement pas répercuter les taux négatifs sur les déposants. En 
outre, ces institutions ayant une activité de transformation de maturités, la pente de la courbe 
des taux comme les niveaux auquel se situent les taux sont importants pour leur rentabilité.  
 
Mais permettez-moi de commenter les principaux effets des réductions de taux d’intérêt 
depuis 2014. Notre politique monétaire entraîne une hausse des prix des actifs réels et une 
diminution des coûts du service de la dette. Les entreprises, les ménages et les États 
endettés peuvent améliorer leurs bilans tout en maintenant une trajectoire de dépenses 
stable parallèlement à une amélioration des perspectives de croissance. De fait, la reprise 
actuelle dans la zone euro est synonyme de diminution du chômage (7 millions d’emplois ont 
été créés depuis 2013), ce qui se traduit par une augmentation du revenu disponible. Ainsi, 
le risque de défaut supporté par le secteur bancaire s’est nettement réduit. Le très bas 
niveau des taux d’intérêt a également permis aux banques de bénéficier de refinancements 
moins onéreux et d’importantes plus-values sur leurs actifs à long terme.  
 
Jusqu’à présent, ces effets semblent avoir contrebalancé la diminution des marges d’intérêt 
des banques. Dans un récent document de travail de la BCE i, Altavilla, Boucinha et Peydró 
affirment même qu’il n’y a pas de relation causale entre le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt et la 
diminution des marges bancaires, laquelle s’explique davantage par la détérioration 
antérieure de la situation macroéconomique que par la politique monétaire active.  
 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
Pour une évaluation exhaustive de nos mesures actuelles, il faut non seulement examiner 
les objectifs visés et les effets secondaires qui ont été observés, mais également les mettre 
en balance avec ce qui se serait passé sans nos mesures exceptionnelles. Quelle serait la 
rentabilité de notre système bancaire aujourd’hui si nous n’avions pas éliminé le risque de 
déflation de 2014-2015 ? Notre paysage bancaire offrirait un spectacle quelque peu 
désastreux. Dans un environnement déflationniste - et nous avons échappé à ce danger 
mortel grâce à notre politique monétaire - le coût du service de la dette pour les emprunteurs 
est plus élevé en termes réels. Les défauts sont plus fréquents et les dettes moins 
soutenables se traduisent par des spreads de crédit plus importants, ce qui accroît encore le 
risque d’une spirale déflationniste de la dette. Mais la zone euro a échappé à cette situation 
et si le prix à payer en est une diminution temporaire de la marge d’intérêts des banques, 
nous pouvons bien accepter de supporter cet inconvénient mineur.  
 
2 - Permettez-moi maintenant d’aborder le prix des actifs et le cycle financier.  
À l’échelle de la zone euro, nous considérons que dans l’ensemble, la situation au regard de 
la stabilité financière est sous contrôle. Les ratios de solvabilité des établissements 
importants de la zone euro se sont constamment améliorés depuis 2014, pour atteindre 
15 % en moyenne au 2
e
 trimestre 2017. Le ratio de dette privée a globalement diminué dans 
la zone euro : de 128 % du PIB en 2011, il est revenu à 122 % aujourd’hui. Les ratios de 
créances douteuses ont également reculé, en particulier pour les petites et moyennes 
entreprises. Je soutiens l’initiative récente du MSU en faveur de règles de provisionnement 
des nouveaux flux de créances douteuses, en dépit de toutes les critiques. De plus, après 
plusieurs années de faiblesse des cycles financiers, la plupart des cycles se sont normalisés 
dans les pays de la zone euro et, dans certains pays, ils se sont même accélérés. C’est le 
cas pour la France. Faut-il s’en inquiéter ? 
 
En France, les prix d’actifs augmentent actuellement dans un contexte de faible volatilité des 
marchés. Dans la mesure où une faible volatilité et une liquidité abondante sont susceptibles 
d’encourager la prise de risque ainsi que la quête de rendement, nous devons être vigilants 
quant au risque de valorisation inexacte généralisée des actifs financiers, qui pourrait freiner 
la reprise économique. Voici quelques chiffres : les prix de l’immobilier résidentiel sont 
redevenus positifs, affichant une croissance annuelle de 2 % en termes réels, et l’activité 
dans le secteur de l’immobilier commercial reste soutenue. Nous demeurons essentiellement 
vigilants en ce qui concerne la dette des sociétés non financières, qui a atteint 74,4 % du PIB 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
contre 61,8 % en 2010. Globalement, la dette privée en France s’élève actuellement à 
130,5 % du PIB 
ii
.  
 
Sans vouloir vous bombarder de chiffres, la principale difficulté aujourd’hui pour les 
décideurs de politique économique est d’arriver à distinguer parmi ces chiffres positifs ce qui 
est une conséquence souhaitable de l’orientation de notre politique monétaire de ce qui 
signale clairement un risque financier potentiel auquel nous devons remédier.  
 
3- Les décideurs de politique économique peuvent-ils parvenir à une meilleure 
combinaison de la politique monétaire et de la politique macroprudentielle ? 
Comme je l’ai déjà dit, la dette privée en pourcentage du PIB a globalement diminué dans la 
zone euro. Mais dans certains pays, le cycle financier se redresse alors que, dans le même 
temps, l’inflation augmente lentement, mais reste inférieure à notre objectif.  
 
Déjà avant la crise de 2008, les banquiers centraux étaient fermement convaincus que la 
stabilité des prix était une condition nécessaire – et pour certains même suffisante – pour 
garantir la stabilité financière. C’est ce que l’on appelle le « consensus de Jackson Hole ». 
Après la crise financière, les déséquilibres financiers étaient considérés comme une énorme 
source de perturbations à laquelle les décideurs devaient remédier, remettant en question la 
relation entre instruments et objectifs de politique monétaire et financière. Voici deux points 
de vue opposés sur cette question.  
 
Une première approche, fidèle au « consensus de Jackson Hole », consiste à séparer 
clairement la stabilité monétaire et la stabilité financière. Conformément à la règle de 
Tinbergen et au principe d’efficience de Mundell, respectivement, une politique doit remplir 
un objectif et chaque instrument de cette politique doit être assigné à l’objectif qu’il est le plus 
à même de remplir. Ainsi, la politique monétaire ne serait capable ni de réduire les 
déséquilibres financiers ni de les créer.  
 
 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
À l’opposé, une approche extrême consiste à considérer que les deux politiques sont 
étroitement imbriquées et que leurs objectifs respectifs pourraient être fusionnés : dans ce 
cas, la politique monétaire pourrait réduire la prise de risque et cibler les bulles de prix 
d’actifs.  
 
Je considère que la pleine adhésion au principe de séparation et la combinaison des deux 
objectifs sont toutes deux des approches trop radicales pour être utilisées à des fins de 
politiques de stabilité monétaire et financière. La mise en œuvre de politiques non 
conventionnelles a gommé la frontière entre ces deux objectifs. J’aimerais citer ici mon 
collègue, le vice-président Vítor Constâncio : « La politique macroprudentielle et la politique 
monétaire font appel à des instruments différents et visent à atteindre des objectifs différents. 
Pourtant, elles doivent être coordonnées, ce qui est une tâche non négligeable » 
iii
. C’est un 
point de vue judicieux. Maintenir le cap de la politique monétaire vers son objectif principal 
de stabilité des prix sans coller aveuglément au principe de séparation peut nous permettre 
de gérer nos deux objectifs principaux et de renforcer notre crédibilité. 
 
Comme vous le savez probablement, la Banque de France, comme de nombreuses autres 
banques centrales, a la double mission de maintenir la stabilité des prix et de préserver la 
stabilité financière depuis 2013. Au titre de sa mission relative à la stabilité financière, le 
gouverneur de la Banque de France est le seul à avoir le droit et la responsabilité de faire 
des propositions pour la mise en œuvre des instruments macroprudentiels au Haut Conseil 
de stabilité financière, l’autorité macroprudentielle française. Je considère ce rôle spécifique 
attribué au gouverneur de la Banque de France comme une opportunité de rendre plus 
cohérents les objectifs en matière de stabilité des prix et de stabilité financière.  
 
Premièrement, la politique macroprudentielle complète le cadre de politique monétaire 
décidé à l’échelle de la zone euro en l’ajustant aux spécificités nationales et en luttant contre 
les risques pour la stabilité financière propres à chaque pays, tout en maintenant une 
transmission harmonieuse de la politique monétaire au sein de la zone euro. 
 
Deuxièmement, la politique macroprudentielle peut permettre d’affiner l’impact global de la 
politique monétaire en veillant à ce que le canal de la prise de risque ne soit pas 
disproportionné dans certains secteurs/pays spécifiques, afin de prévenir le risque 
systémique. Permettez-moi de vous donner deux exemples de ce que nous suivons de très 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
près en France : la hausse des prix de l’immobilier commercial à Paris et l’augmentation de 
la dette des sociétés.  
 
Cela dit, je ne veux pas laisser entendre qu’il n’existe pas de hiérarchie entre les deux 
objectifs. Je préconise une forte complémentarité des objectifs, mais pas une fusion. Pour 
être plus explicite, une stratégie de politique monétaire qui cible les prix des actifs est pour 
moi une erreur. En tant que banquiers centraux, nous devons éviter de jeter le trouble dans 
l’esprit des agents économiques ; notre rôle est d’ancrer les anticipations et de garantir la 
continuité des activités.  
 
4- Des défis doivent encore être relevés afin de fournir aux autorités la panoplie 
d’outils nécessaires pour préserver la stabilité financière 
Pour gagner en efficacité, nous devons encore relever un certain nombre de défis pour 
arriver à un cadre optimal de réglementation macroprudentielle. Premièrement, nous devons 
achever le cadre réglementaire pour les banques, avec la finalisation de la réforme de 
Bâle III : je souhaite et espère vivement que nous pourrons bientôt parvenir à un accord 
équitable et raisonnable. Une révision du cadre macroprudentiel européen est en cours 
actuellement au niveau de la Commission européenne. En outre, des progrès décisifs 
doivent être faits afin que les autorités macroprudentielles disposent d’instruments 
convenablement conçus pour faire face aux risques financiers au-delà du secteur bancaire. 
Le financement de marché, le secteur bancaire parallèle, les FinTech, les fonds de pension, 
les innovations financières font tous partie du champ de la politique macroprudentielle dans 
la mesure où ils sont susceptibles de poser un risque financier à nos économies. Notre 
prochain problème concerne moins la solvabilité des banques que la liquidité des 
non-banques. 
 
Il est également de notre devoir d’achever le cadre réglementaire européen avec la 
finalisation du mécanisme de résolution afin de rendre plus harmonieux le fonctionnement du 
secteur bancaire – conformément à l’esprit de l’Union Bancaire, en permettant également à 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux de se développer, dans le cadre de l’approche holistique de 
« l’Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » que j’ai proposée.  
 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
Enfin, nous devons garantir partout une mise en œuvre cohérente du nouveau cadre 
réglementaire et éviter tout retour en arrière à l’extérieur de l’Europe. La stabilité financière 
est un bien commun mondial ; par conséquent, l’arbitrage réglementaire ne doit pas devenir 
une option. 
** 
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure. La crédibilité des banquiers centraux repose 
aujourd’hui sur leur capacité à reconnaître la relative perméabilité entre la politique 
monétaire et la politique macroprudentielle, en particulier dans un contexte qui pourrait 
associer un cycle financier haussier à une faible inflation. Cela nécessite une action 
cohérente de la part des banques centrales, qui couvre les deux domaines : la stabilité des 
prix et la stabilité financière. En nous éloignant d’un principe de séparation excessivement 
strict, essayons d’être des banquiers centraux complets et cohérents, avec un rôle actif dans 
la politique monétaire ainsi que dans les politiques macroprudentielles.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être à Tokyo cet après-midi et de prononcer ce discours à l’université 
Waseda, dans ce magnifique amphithéâtre qui porte le nom de votre illustre fondateur. 
L’université Waseda est renommée pour la qualité de son enseignement et ses principes 
fondateurs – indépendance académique, application pratique des connaissances, éducation 
des citoyens – reflètent l’ambition éducative de cette institution. Je voudrais remercier 
chaleureusement le président Kaoru Kamata et le professeur Kazumi Shimizu pour leurs 
aimables discours de bienvenue. Vous avez tous deux vécu en France et avez conservé des 
liens étroits avec notre pays depuis lors. Ce n’est donc pas un hasard si l’université Waseda, 
sous la présidence de M. Kamata, illustre de façon active et remarquable les liens forts qui 
unissent le Japon et la France. Ce lieu est donc particulièrement bien choisi pour parler des 
défis de l’ordre économique multilatéral, d’autant plus que le Japon accorde une attention 
particulière à la coopération internationale. Ce sujet peut être examiné à deux niveaux : au 
niveau international et au niveau régional. Cet après-midi, j’évoquerai dans un premier temps 
le niveau international et la nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif pour faire face à nos défis 
globaux. Je me pencherai ensuite sur le niveau régional. Je ne parlerai pas de l’Asie, mais je 
traiterai essentiellement de l’Europe, et de l’Union économique et monétaire. 
 
** 
 
I. La nécessité d'un multilatéralisme actif pour relever nos défis globaux.  
Permettez-moi de commencer par mon premier point : la nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif 
pour relever nos défis globaux. Nous devons nous efforcer de maintenir les règles du jeu 
collectives, à l’échelle internationale, et avec l’ensemble de nos partenaires. Dans le 
contexte actuel, la coopération internationale entre les pays est plus importante que jamais : 
il est essentiel de préserver l’amélioration de l’environnement économique mondial. En effet, 
la reprise mondiale s’est accélérée depuis 2016 : selon les dernières prévisions du FMI, la 
croissance mondiale devrait s’établir à 3,6 % en 2017, après 3,2 % en 2016, tandis qu’au 
Japon, la croissance du PIB en volume devrait se redresser pour atteindre 1,5 % en 2017, 
après 1,0 % en 2016. En outre, la croissance dans la zone euro devrait atteindre au moins 
2,2 % cette année, reflétant une reprise économique robuste. Toutefois, deux risques 
majeurs menacent la croissance : l’instabilité financière et le protectionnisme.  
 
S’agissant de l’instabilité financière, la hausse continue de l’endettement mondial public et 
privé depuis le début des années 2000, qui est passé de 190 % du PIB mondial en 2001 à 
230 % en 2016, est devenue un sujet de préoccupation. C’est ce qui a entraîné la crise 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
de 2008, mais cette tendance ne s’est malheureusement pas ralentie depuis lors ; la dette 
privée des pays émergents (notamment la dette des entreprises) a augmenté de façon 
particulièrement rapide. Depuis les sommets du G20 de Londres et de Pittsburgh en 2009, 
l’effort de réglementation qui a été entrepris est sans précédent, notamment dans le 
secteur bancaire : en accroissant à la fois la quantité et la qualité des fonds propres de ce 
secteur, la réforme de Bâle III a considérablement renforcé la robustesse des banques ; de 
plus, elle permet désormais de mieux tenir compte des différents risques auxquels les 
banques sont exposées, grâce à l'introduction de deux nouveaux ratios de liquidité relatifs 
aux niveaux de trésorerie des banques. Je suis convaincu que nous allons conclure un 
accord équitable et raisonnable lors de notre réunion du GHOS de jeudi prochain. Cela serait 
très appréciable pour notre ordre financier international.  
 
Mais au-delà de Bâle III, nous devons finaliser les mesures destinées aux non-banques. 
Nous devons assurer un équilibre entre les circuits de financement. La priorité s’est à 
présent reportée de la solvabilité des banques, qui s’est nettement améliorée, vers la 
liquidité du secteur bancaire parallèle, notamment les fonds et sociétés de gestion de 
portefeuille qui sont exposés à des risques de retraits massifs soudains sous l’effet de la 
panique. En outre, nous devons nous assurer que ce cadre réglementaire approuvé à 
l’échelle internationale est appliqué partout de façon cohérente. Une déréglementation 
unilatérale ne serait rien d’autre qu’un scénario perdant-perdant, qui entraînerait de graves 
conséquences pour la stabilité du système financier mondial – en ouvrant la voie à la 
prochaine crise financière – et pour l’environnement concurrentiel des banques américaines, 
japonaises et européennes.  
 
Le second risque est lié aux tendances protectionnistes, notamment aux États-Unis. Nous, 
les Européens et les Japonais, main dans la main avec le Canada et d’autres pays ailleurs 
dans le monde, devons résolument défendre des relations économiques internationales 
basées sur des règles et des institutions multilatérales respectées de tous : leur dégradation 
freinerait les échanges et l’activité économique à l’échelle mondiale. Dans un discours 
récent, le Gouverneur de la Banque du Japon, Haruhiko Kuroda, a souligné « l’importance 
de la coopération multilatérale ». Pour reprendre ses mots : « Les économies doivent 
surmonter leurs propres intérêts réducteurs pour coopérer et se coordonner dans une 
perspective plus large [...]. Ceci requiert un cadre institutionnel efficace comme le FMI, les 
banques multilatérales de développement et le G20 »
i
. Ces propos sont particulièrement 
pertinents dans le contexte actuel.

II. Des réponses régionales : le cas de l’Europe 
 
Je vais maintenant aborder mon deuxième point : les réponses régionales, en prenant 
l’Europe comme exemple. L’Union européenne est un cas unique de coopération très 
avancée entre pays à un niveau régional. La coopération présente évidemment de multiples 
facettes, mais je voudrais aujourd’hui mettre l’accent sur trois atouts économiques et sociaux 
partagés par l’Europe : sa monnaie unique, son marché unique, et le modèle social qui lui 
est propre. 
Trois atouts européens : sa monnaie unique, son marché unique et le modèle social 
qui lui est propre. 
Premièrement, avec l’euro, nous partageons une monnaie solide qui est reconnue dans le 
monde entier. Permettez-moi de le dire d’emblée : l’Union monétaire peut être considérée 
comme l’un des plus grands succès de l’Europe. Comme vous le savez, la monnaie unique a 
été officiellement lancée en 1992, avec le Traité de Maastricht, et a été introduite en 1999. 
Mais Maastricht et l’euro font naturellement partie d’une histoire plus vaste : celle de 
l’Europe, et de sa réussite exceptionnelle pour passer de la guerre à la paix. En effet, l’euro 
nous a fourni un symbole fort d’unité entre les nations européennes. Il est vrai que l’on 
constate actuellement un certain euroscepticisme et une montée du populisme, mais une 
nette majorité de citoyens de la zone euro soutient aujourd’hui l’euro (à 73 % selon le dernier 
Eurobaromètre
ii
). De douze au départ, le nombre de pays participants est passé à dix-neuf 
aujourd’hui. Sept pays supplémentaires ont décidé de rejoindre l’euro depuis 1999 – le 
dernier en date étant la Lituanie en 2015 – et aucun n’a souhaité le quitter. L’euro n’est pas 
une utopie technocratique : il s’agit d’une décision politique et démocratique, soutenue par 
une nette majorité de citoyens depuis maintenant vingt-cinq ans. 
 
Le fait est que l’euro a déjà apporté des bénéfices concrets. Conformément à notre mandat, 
l’inflation a été maîtrisée. Le pouvoir d’achat des ménages en bénéficie directement et cela 
contribue à créer la confiance dans la valeur de la monnaie. Plaçons-nous dans une 
perspective historique. Sur les dix-huit années qui ont précédé l’introduction de l’euro (1981 
– 1998), l’inflation a baissé progressivement, mais elle est restée à 4,6 % en moyenne, avec 
des écarts importants entre les pays. Sur les dix-huit années qui ont suivi cette introduction 
(1999 – 2016), l’inflation a été beaucoup plus stable, se situant à 1,7 % en moyenne, et les 
écarts entre pays se sont réduits. Par ailleurs, une meilleure maîtrise de l’inflation signifie un 
coût du financement plus faible, car elle réduit les primes de risque. Tous les acteurs 
économiques bénéficient des taux d’intérêt plus faibles : les ménages qui achètent un bien 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
immobilier, les entreprises qui investissent, mais aussi les États et donc les contribuables. 
De plus, l’euro a contribué à consolider le marché unique européen, en supprimant les 
fluctuations de change pour les entreprises, en simplifiant la vie quotidienne des citoyens et 
en favorisant l’intégration des marchés de capitaux.  
 
Enfin, la taille économique de la zone euro et la stabilité de sa monnaie ont permis à 
l’euro de jouer un rôle important au niveau international. Aujourd’hui, l’euro représente 20 % 
des réserves internationales, au deuxième rang derrière le dollar des États-Unis. Avoir une 
monnaie reconnue au plan international procure des gains économiques : les marchés 
financiers sont plus attractifs pour les investisseurs nationaux et étrangers, plus liquides, et 
donc plus efficients. Mais cela représente aussi un poids politique : quand Mario Draghi parle 
au G7 ou au G20, le monde entier écoute l’Europe avec attention, exactement comme 
lorsque Janet Yellen s’exprime au nom des États-Unis.  
 
Globalement, la liste de ces bénéfices est impressionnante, surtout si l’on considère que 
l’euro n’a que dix-neuf ans. Qui plus est, nous sommes parvenus à cela malgré la crise 
financière mondiale, qui a provoqué la récession la plus profonde depuis trois générations, et 
malgré la crise de la dette souveraine dans la zone euro quelques années après. La solidité 
de la reprise économique dans la zone euro nous permet à présent de poursuivre une 
normalisation progressive de notre politique monétaire. Le 26 octobre, le Conseil des 
gouverneurs de la BCE, en divisant par deux le volume de nos achats mensuels nets 
d’actifs, a fait un pas décisif vers leur éventuel terme, tout en maintenant, avec tous nos 
autres instruments, l’orientation accommodante de notre politique monétaire à un degré 
élevé. 
 
Deuxièmement, nous partageons en Europe un grand marché unique. Il supprime toutes 
les frontières intérieures et les obstacles réglementaires à la libre circulation des biens, des 
capitaux, des services et des personnes dans l’Union européenne. C’est un atout 
considérable qui nous appartient à tous – les 27 pays –, et ce n’est pas une coïncidence si 
l’accès au marché unique est au cœur du débat sur le Brexit. Nous ne pouvons préjuger de 
l’issue des négociations futures et nous ne voulons en aucune façon « punir » le Royaume-
Uni. Mais nous devons respecter un principe de cohérence : l’accès au marché unique doit 
continuer d’aller de pair avec le respect strict de toutes ses règles. Il ne peut pas y avoir 
d’Europe « à la carte » (cherry-picking), ni de « passager clandestin » (free-riding). Pour le 
secteur des services financiers, cela signifie que l’on peut difficilement s’attendre à obtenir 
un passeport européen si l’on n’accepte pas les règles du marché unique.  
Page 5 sur 7 
 
Troisièmement, nous partageons un modèle social commun qui combine un haut 
niveau de service public, des inégalités relativement faibles –nettement moins fortes que 
dans la société américaine – et une forte intensité du dialogue social ; et ceci au sein d’une 
économie de marché. À l’heure où la mondialisation peut produire de nombreux laissés-
pour-compte dans les économies avancées, où le débat à propos des inégalités revient au 
premier plan – et ce sont des défis réels derrière la vague populiste – ce n’est pas le moment 
de renoncer à notre modèle social. L’Europe et le Japon sont assez proches dans leurs 
choix.  
Comment aller de l’avant : les quatre accélérateurs de l’Union économique. 
Les atouts que j’ai présentés sont un acquis précieux pour l’Europe. Nous devons 
maintenant travailler activement à les développer, et ne pas nous reposer paresseusement 
sur nos lauriers. Je vais maintenant présenter quelques axes d’amélioration. En effet, nous 
avons clairement réussi à construire une Union monétaire, mais ce n’est pas suffisant. Il est 
temps à présent de réaliser des progrès concrets en matière d’Union économique, pour 
laquelle nous n’avons pas encore été très efficaces. Nous sommes d’accord sur le 
« pourquoi ». La politique monétaire ne peut pas tout faire et nous ne devons donc pas la 
surcharger. En outre, nous visons plus de stabilité, face au risque d’une prochaine crise qui 
trouverait la zone euro démunie, avec toutes ses répercussions politiques et économiques 
dommageables ; et plus de croissance, pour combler notre retard passé par rapport aux 
États-Unis et traiter enfin la maladie mortelle du chômage de masse en Europe. Pour ce qui 
est du « quand », nous avons manifestement une opportunité historique unique avec la 
reprise économique, le nouveau Président français et aussi des gouvernements stables aux 
Pays-Bas et, espérons-le, en Allemagne.  
 
En ayant cet objectif présent à l’esprit, comment pouvons-nous concrètement avancer sur 
l’Union économique ? Il existe une condition préalable indispensable : la mise en œuvre des 
réformes nationales. Permettez-moi de souligner, en tant que banquier central indépendant, 
que le nouveau gouvernement français, sous la présidence de M. Macron, a déjà pris des 
mesures décisives dans cette direction. Une réforme du marché du travail de grande 
ampleur a été approuvée l’été dernier et a déjà été mise en application. Une réforme de la 
formation professionnelle et de l’apprentissage est attendue pour l’année prochaine. En 
outre, des mesures ont été prises afin de maintenir le déficit public au-dessous du seuil de 
3 % du PIB. Pour la première fois depuis 10 ans, le déficit public devrait être inférieur à ce 
seuil en 2017 (2,9 %). Il va sans dire que ces efforts doivent être poursuivis à l’avenir. En 
outre, selon moi, il nous faut activer quatre accélérateurs:  
Page 6 sur 7 
 
- un accélérateur macro : une stratégie économique collective au sein de la zone euro. 
Cet accélérateur repose sur un constat simple : la croissance économique et l’emploi 
seraient plus élevés dans la zone euro si nous combinions davantage de réformes 
structurelles dans les pays où elles sont nécessaires, comme la France ou l’Italie, et 
davantage de relance dans les pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre, comme 
l’Allemagne ou les Pays-Bas. Pour parvenir à cette stratégie économique collective, les 
États membres doivent sceller un accord, qui pourrait être préparé et adopté dès 2018. Il 
pourrait être complété par la création d’un instrument de prêt pour la stabilisation, pour 
aider par des crédits les États membres confrontés à un choc asymétrique. Ceci pourrait 
faire partie d’un Fonds monétaire européen, à condition que ses missions soient élargies 
au-delà de l’actuel Mécanisme européen de stabilité.  
 
- un accélérateur micro : c’est-à-dire une Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation. L’objectif est de mobiliser les 350 milliards d’euros d’excédent d’épargne de 
la zone euro, notamment en faveur des fonds propres qui sont la clé d’une économie 
d’innovation, et de mettre en synergie, grâce à un pilotage intégré, le plan Juncker, 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux et l’Union bancaire.  
 
- un accélérateur budgétaire, une fois que nous aurons consolidé la confiance mutuelle 
entre les États membres et progressé vers davantage de convergence économique : le 
budget de la zone euro servirait à financer, au bénéfice de tous les pays, certains « biens 
communs européens » dont le numérique, la transition énergétique, la sécurité, et la 
protection face aux migrations.  
 
- un accélérateur institutionnel : le quatrième accélérateur n’est pas sur le fond, mais 
serait plutôt un « facilitateur » des trois premiers. En termes d’institutions, il nous faudrait 
d’abord un ministre des Finances de la zone euro, président de l’Eurogroupe et membre 
de la Commission, appuyé sur un Trésor européen ; mais aussi une formation euro du 
Parlement, pour assurer la légitimité démocratique des institutions et des décisions. Mais 
cela ne fait sens que si nous progressons sur le fond ; sinon ce ne serait guère plus 
qu’un simple habillage de façade.  
 
Les deux derniers accélérateurs, budgétaire et institutionnel, supposent des changements de 
Traités, sauf à n’être que très partiels. Cela ne doit pas nous empêcher de progresser dès à 
présent sur les deux premiers accélérateurs, pour remettre en marche l’Union économique. 
Ces accélérateurs contribueraient aux fonctions de la politique économique définies par 
Musgrave 
iii
 : allocation, stabilisation et distribution. La fonction d’allocation serait à l’évidence 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
le rôle de l’accélérateur micro, mais également celui de l’accélérateur budgétaire. La fonction 
de stabilisation pourrait être assurée principalement par l’accélérateur macro, mais 
également par l’accélérateur micro, grâce à l’amélioration du partage du risque privé et, 
peut-être aussi, par l’accélérateur budgétaire. Enfin, une éventuelle fonction de distribution 
pourrait revenir à l’accélérateur budgétaire, à condition que sa mise en œuvre ne crée pas 
une « union de transfert », qui ne profiterait qu’à certains pays. 
** 
J’aimerais conclure mon discours par une citation de Kazuo Ishiguro, à qui le Prix Nobel de 
Littérature 2017 a été décerné et qui est né au Japon : « Si vous imaginez que [...] vous êtes 
déjà arrivé à la perfection, vous n’atteindrez jamais les sommets dont vous êtes 
certainement capable » 
iv
. Ces mots pourraient s’appliquer à notre coopération internationale 
depuis la crise, tout comme à l’Union économique et monétaire européenne. Toutes deux 
sont des succès indéniables, et cela mérite d’être souligné. Mais cela ne devrait pas nous 
empêcher de progresser vers un meilleur fonctionnement de l’Union économique. Je suis 
fermement convaincu que nous pouvons réaliser des choses qui même aujourd’hui peuvent 
encore nous paraître inimaginables. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Déclaration de François Villeroy de Galhau,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
12 Décembre 2017 – Paris  
 
One Planet Summit 
 
François Villeroy de Galhau : « Des Banques centrales qui se préoccupent de ""verdir""  
le système financier, c'est peut-être inattendu, mais ce n'est pas une mode. C'est une conviction :  
la stabilité climatique fait partie, à long terme, des déterminants de la stabilité financière, qui est notre 
responsabilité.  
 Et donc nous à la Banque de France avons décidé d'agir concrètement : nous créons aujourd'hui  
à Paris un Réseau dédié de superviseurs et de Banques centrales . Un Réseau efficace : 8 banques 
centrales et superviseurs de trois continents - People’s Bank of China, Monetary Authority  
of Singapore, Banco de Mexico, et en Europe, à nos côtés, la Banque d’Angleterre, la Bundesbank en 
Allemagne, et les superviseurs néerlandais et suédois. Et ce Réseau est bien sûr ouvert aux 
nouveaux participants, tous engagés à partager leurs analyses et leurs innovations pour renforcer 
deux incitations-clés : 
1) Comment développer les opportunités liées au financement de la transition ?  
Les ""green bonds"" et les ""climate-aligned bonds"" se développent mais il faut aller plus loin, au-delà  
du seul financement obligataire, et plus vite encore [presque 1 trillion de $ d’encours d’obligations 
vertes et assimilées en 2017, mais des besoins allant jusqu'à 95 trillions d'ici 2030], tout en préservant 
l'intégrité des labels et des marchés face aux tentations possibles de ""green washing"". 
 2) Comment mesurer les risques de long terme associés au changement climatique ?  
Il y a la photographie : c'est la ""disclosure"", c’est-à-dire la publication des expositions actuelles, 
volontaire selon la Task Force [on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)  
du FSB] présidée par Michael Bloomberg, ou obligatoire déjà en France. Et il y a le film, en dynamique 
: nous commençons à imaginer des stress tests prospectifs pour les assurances et les banques, 
associés à des scénarios de changement physiques et économiques. 
Concrètement, deux livrables de notre Réseau sont prévus dès 2018 : une conférence  
de haut niveau en avril à Amsterdam, co-organisée avec nos collègues néerlandais  
et britanniques et la publication de premiers retours d’expérience et d’un programme de travail. 
Comptez sur la Banque de France, qui assure le secrétariat du Réseau, pour qu'on passe  
de la théorie -nécessaire- à la pratique opérationnelle, qui l'est plus encore. »

20 ans du label Finansol 
« L’innovation financière au service de la solidarité »

Gouverneur de la Banque de France

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir à la Banque de France pour cette conférence 
organisée à l’occasion des 20 ans du label Finansol et consacrée à ce beau thème de 
l’innovation financière au service de la solidarité. Nous avons déjà eu le plaisir d’organiser 
une conférence avec Finansol ici-même en avril dernier, et je me réjouis de vous accueillir 
de nouveau aujourd’hui pour cet anniversaire que nous souhaitons marquer particulièrement. 
En effet, le label Finansol, qui est le premier label de finance éthique à avoir été créé en 
France, a joué un rôle important dans le développement de la finance solidaire, en rassurant 
les épargnants et en contribuant à donner de la notoriété à ce type de financement. Le label 
a, par ailleurs, accompagné et soutenu de nombreuses innovations à caractère solidaire 
comme le capital citoyen solidaire, l’épargne de partage ou encore les fonds solidaires dits 
« 90-10 ». Le succès grandissant de la finance solidaire et son utilité apparaissent très 
nettement dans les données du Baromètre 2017 de la Finance solidaire produites par 
l’association Finansol : environ un million d’épargnants français investissent aujourd’hui dans 
des produits solidaires, tandis que l’encours de finance solidaire a atteint 10 milliards d’euros 
fin 2016, après 15 années consécutives de hausse. En permettant d’investir dans des projets 
collectifs à forte utilité sociale ou environnementale, ce mode de financement a permis de 
créer ou consolider 49 000 emplois et de reloger 5 500 personnes en 2016. 
 
La Banque de France n’est bien évidemment pas insensible aux progrès de la finance 
solidaire. Cette question fait largement écho à notre engagement social en tant qu’institution 
publique agissant au service de l’intérêt général. L’engagement social fait partie de nos 
valeurs et de notre ADN depuis de nombreuses années. L’année dernière, nous avons 
décidé d’aller encore plus loin : dans notre plan stratégique Ambitions 2020, nous avons 
choisi d’affirmer notre responsabilité sociale d’entreprise (RSE) autour de quatre 
engagements clairs, avec des exigences de résultat ambitieuses : un engagement 
économique et citoyen, un engagement éducatif et culturel, un engagement environnemental 
et un engagement vis-à-vis de nos collaborateurs. Ces quatre engagements se déclinent très 
concrètement en 11 actions prioritaires. Chacune d’elles est appuyée par un « sponsor » de 
haut niveau clairement identifié au sein de la Banque de France, et comporte des indicateurs 
chiffrés pour mesurer nos progrès. Ce matin, je vais dans un premier temps m’attarder sur 
celui de nos quatre grands engagements dont les enjeux sont les plus proches de ceux de la 
finance solidaire : notre engagement économique et citoyen, au service des entreprises et 
des particuliers. Puis, je présenterai quelques-unes des actions que nous menons au titre 
des trois autres engagements de RSE que nous avons pris en faveur de l’éducation, de 
l’environnement et de nos  collaborateurs.  
Page 2 sur 4 
 
** 
I. Notre engagement économique et citoyen, au service des entreprises et des 
particuliers.  
Les actions que nous menons dans le cadre de notre engagement économique et citoyen 
visent d’abord à soutenir le dynamisme des entreprises et des territoires. Ces actions 
s’inscrivent dans le cadre notre mission de services à l’économie qui est l’une de nos trois 
grandes missions aux cotés de la stratégie monétaire et de la stabilité financière. Pour cela, 
la Banque de France prend appui sur son réseau  d’implantations territoriales afin 
d’intervenir au plus près des entreprises, notamment les PME et les TPE qui constituent une 
grande part des entreprises du secteur de l’économie sociale et solidaire. Ainsi, depuis 
septembre 2016, la Banque de France a mis en place un réseau de 102 correspondants 
TPE départementaux chargés d’accueillir les dirigeants de TPE, de les conseiller et de les 
orienter vers les services et réseaux professionnels les plus adaptés à leurs besoins de 
financement ou de conseil. Un peu plus d’un an après la mise en place du dispositif, plus de 
2000 TPE ont été accompagnées. De plus, la Banque de France agit en faveur des 
entreprises en réalisant la cotation de 250 000 d’entre elles, qui réalisent plus de 750 000 
euros de chiffre d’affaires. Ceci facilite l’accès au crédit à de nombreuses PME et TPE. 
Depuis 3 ans, nous intégrons également des critères RSE dans notre cotation, car nous 
sommes convaincus que la prise en compte des aspects environnementaux et sociaux 
contribue à la  résilience des entreprises.   
 
La Banque de France œuvre également en faveur des personnes en situation de fragilité 
financière. Au titre de la mission qui lui a été confiée par l’État, la Banque de France agit 
pour prévenir et traiter le surendettement : nous résolvons ainsi environ 200 000 
situations de surendettement par an et nous nous sommes fixé pour objectif chiffré de faire 
baisser le taux de redépôts de dossier à 37 % d’ici à 2020. Par ailleurs, la Banque de France 
s’est résolument engagée à favoriser le microcrédit, en raison de l’importance de ce type 
de financement comme facteur d’inclusion sociale et économique. Nous avons mis en place 
une collecte spécifique de données statistiques sur le microcrédit, qui éclairent les travaux 
de l’Observatoire de l’inclusion bancaire, dont j’assure la présidence. Elle permet de 
mesurer, quantitativement et qualitativement, la fragilité financière et l’effectivité des mesures 
qui doivent être déployées pour la réduire. Nous attribuons aussi régulièrement deux prix 
nationaux du microcrédit qui récompensent des parcours emblématiques de la contribution 
du microcrédit à la lutte contre les exclusions : la remise des prochains prix aura lieu au 
deuxième trimestre 2018. Cette année, pour renforcer encore le dialogue, nous avons 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
également lancé les Rencontres régionales du microcrédit qui associent les acteurs publics, 
bancaires et associatifs du secteur. La Banque de France s’est fixé l’objectif – très ambitieux 
d’autant qu’il ne dépend pas que d’elle – que l’encours de microcrédits atteigne 2 milliards 
d’euros en 2020 contre 1,4 milliard en 2016 – voilà encore un autre indicateur chiffré. 
 
II. Nos trois autres engagements de RSE, en faveur de l’éducation, de 
l’environnement et de nos collaborateurs. 
Je vais désormais présenter – plus brièvement – les trois autres engagements que nous 
avons pris dans le cadre de notre stratégie RSE. Ces engagements, moins directement liés 
à nos missions premières, ont également trait à la solidarité, c’est pourquoi je tiens à les 
mentionner.  
 
En premier lieu, nous avons pris un engagement éducatif et culturel. Dans ce cadre, la 
Banque de France agit notamment en faveur du renforcement de l’éducation économique, 
budgétaire et financière des publics qui est l’un des éléments du plan national de lutte contre 
la pauvreté. La Banque de France a été désignée fin 2016 opérateur pour la mise en œuvre 
de la stratégie nationale d’éducation financière. À ce titre, nous coordonnons l’ensemble des 
acteurs et des actions dans ce domaine. Nous avons ainsi mis en ligne dès janvier 2017 un 
portail pédagogique appelé « Mes questions d’Argent » qui, bien évidemment, fournit aussi 
des informations sur la finance solidaire. Déjà 300 000 pages du site ont été consultées 
depuis son ouverture et notre objectif est d’atteindre 700 000 pages vues par an d’ici à 2020. 
La convention nationale que nous avons signée en octobre dernier avec le Ministère de 
l’Éducation nationale participe également de notre ambition de sensibilisation de tous les 
publics, y compris les enseignants et les élèves. Dans la même logique, nous allons ouvrir 
fin 2018 à Paris le premier musée de l’économie et de la monnaie : « Citéco ». 
 
Nous avons par ailleurs pris un engagement environnemental. Nous avons ainsi parmi nos 
objectifs de sensibiliser d’ici 2020 la quasi-totalité des établissements bancaires et 
d’assurance au risque climatique. En outre, dans le sillage du « One Planet Summit » qui 
s’est tenu à Paris le 12 décembre dernier, je tiens à souligner tout particulièrement les efforts 
de la Banque de France pour favoriser le développement de la « Finance verte ». À l'initiative 
de la Banque de France, huit banques centrales et autorités de supervision du monde entier 
mettent en place un « Réseau des superviseurs et des banques centrales pour le 
verdissement du système financier ». Ce réseau ambitionne de renforcer la réponse 
mondiale nécessaire pour respecter les objectifs de l'Accord de Paris et améliorer le rôle du 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
système financier dans la gestion des risques et la mobilisation des capitaux en faveur des 
investissements verts et à faible émission de carbone. La première réunion sera organisée 
en début d’année prochaine, tandis qu’un état des lieux des travaux existants sera dressé 
dans le courant de l'année.  
 
Enfin, nous avons pris un engagement vis-à-vis de nos collaborateurs. Il s’agit pour nous 
d’agir toujours plus en employeur responsable. Nous veillons par exemple à assurer la 
promotion de la parité et la diversité des profils et nous nous attachons également à favoriser 
le développement des compétences et l’évolution professionnelle, avec un objectif de 
délivrer 1200 certifications d’ici 2020.  
** 
Pour la Banque de France comme pour Finansol, la solidarité n’est donc pas qu’un mot, c’est 
une ambition que nous nous attachons à promouvoir au quotidien. C’est pourquoi, nous 
tenions à accompagner Finansol dans cet anniversaire, qui n’est pas seulement l’occasion 
de faire un bilan, mais aussi une opportunité pour parler de l’avenir. À ce propos et en 
préambule de cette matinée d’échanges, je souhaiterais souligner les défis qui attendent la 
finance solidaire et le label Finansol. Ces défis sont parfaitement identifiés dans l’étude que 
vous publiez aujourd’hui : (i) accompagner davantage le développement des nouveaux fonds 
à impact social, (ii) labelliser des plateformes de financement participatif et (iii) porter le label 
Finansol à un niveau européen. La question de l’innovation financière demeure centrale et 
l’étude trace des perspectives très intéressantes pour les vingt prochaines années. Je vous 
souhaite à tous une excellente matinée. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Le grand rendez-vous de l’investissement productif 
Paris, lundi 22 janvier 2018 
 
Intervention à l’Assemblée nationale  
de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
« Financement en fonds propres des entreprises en France et en 
zone euro : quels besoins ? quels outils ? quel rôle  
pour la Banque de France ? »

Mesdames, Messieurs les parlementaires, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de participer à ce grand rendez-vous de l’investissement 
productif, qui est placé sous le signe d’un paradoxe. La France est un pays 
d’épargne et celle des ménages est très abondante. Leur patrimoine financier 
représente 4 924 milliards d’euros (au 30 septembre 2017), plus de deux fois le PIB 
annuel. Pourtant, nos entreprises manquent encore de fonds propres et n’ont 
souvent comme seul recours que l’endettement. Il importe donc de s’interroger : (A) 
quelle est exactement la situation française et comment se compare-t-elle à celle 
étrangère ? (B) quelles voies pour mettre davantage l’épargne au service de la 
croissance et de l’emploi ?  
** 
A. Quelle est la situation française ? 
1) En France comme dans la zone euro, les entreprises se financent insuffisamment 
par fonds propres, et l’épargne des ménages y est peu investie. [slide 2] Le contraste 
est grand entre les États-Unis, où les fonds propres des entreprises représentent 123 
% du PIB, et la France où le ratio n’est que de 74 %. De ce point de vue, la France 
ne se distingue pas de l’ensemble de la zone euro (73 %). [slide 3] Quand un 
ménage américain investit la majorité, 57 % exactement, de son épargne financière 
en actions, un ménage français la place à l’inverse, à 69 %, en produits de taux, y 
compris parce qu’on l’y a incité depuis longtemps, par des exemptions fiscales 
notamment.    
2) Cette situation, assez générale en Europe, est plus préoccupante en France car 
les entreprises françaises y ont plus besoin d’apports de fonds propres que chez nos 
voisins. Pourquoi cela ? Parce qu’elles ne semblent pas disposer des mêmes 
capacités d’autofinancement de leurs investissements que leurs homologues 
allemandes certes, mais aussi du Sud de l’Europe. [slide 4] Regardons « la capacité 
de financement » des entreprises, c’est-à-dire la différence entre leur 
autofinancement et leurs investissements. On observe très clairement que ce solde 
est nul, alors qu’il est franchement positif chez nos voisins : 4 % de la valeur ajoutée 
en Allemagne, 3,6 % en Italie. [slide 5] Cette situation est – il faut bien le dire – 
anormale chez nos voisins et peut refléter un déficit d’investissement. La différence 
française est aujourd’hui la résultante d’un facteur positif – des investissements plus 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
forts – et d’un élément négatif – un autofinancement encore faible relativement, 
même si les mesures gouvernementales ont accru quelque peu les marges depuis 
2014. [slide 6] L’endettement de nos entreprises s’accroît dès lors beaucoup plus vite 
que chez nos voisins : en un an, l’endettement des sociétés non financières s’est 
alourdi de 2,6 points de PIB en France, alors qu’il a été stable en Allemagne et qu’il 
s’allégeait de 2,1 points en Italie. Nous sommes maintenant significativement au-
dessus de la moyenne de la zone euro. 
3) Nous avons donc deux défis : une dette qui croît un peu trop vite, et pas assez de 
fonds propres pour financer l’innovation.  
Face à cette situation, il est tout d’abord indispensable d’éviter une course sans limite 
à l’endettement. Le Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière, sous la présidence du 
ministre Bruno Le Maire, a donc décidé en décembre une mesure macroprudentielle 
visant à limiter la forte croissance de l’endettement de certaines grandes entreprises, 
y compris via les marchés. Cette mesure – qui est une première en Europe – 
s’appliquera au 1
er
 juillet après l’accord des autorités européennes.   
Mais parallèlement nous devons mieux orienter une épargne financière pourtant 
abondante : 5 % du revenu brut disponible en France. Notre problème n’est pas de 
quantité, mais de qualité. Globalement, l’économie française ne manque pas de 
crédits mais manque de fonds propres. Une économie en rattrapage, comme 
l’Europe de l’après-guerre ou les pays émergents aujourd’hui, se finance bien par 
dette car le chemin y est relativement balisé. Mais le financement par fonds propres 
est la clé de l’innovation pour les entreprises, et donc de la croissance dans les 
économies proches de la « frontière technologique », comme aux États-Unis et – 
nous le souhaitons – en France : l’innovation étant plus risquée, son financement doit 
en effet rapporter davantage.  
 
B. Quelles solutions ?  
Tout ne dépend pas ici de la finance bien sûr : les entreprises elles-mêmes, dont les 
PME et ETI familiales, doivent être prêtes à ouvrir leur capital et leurs conseils 
d’administration pour pouvoir se développer. Ce n’est jamais une décision facile, et 
cet « effet bonzaï » sur la taille des entreprises françaises est connu.  
Page 3 sur 5 
 
1) Mais du côté du financement, la priorité aujourd’hui est d’imaginer de nouveaux 
produits d’épargne, plus productifs pour notre économie.  
Dans cette démarche, les assureurs ont un rôle clé à jouer : le secteur  
de l’assurance est en effet le principal investisseur institutionnel de la zone euro, et 
l’assurance-vie est de loin le premier placement financier des Français (1 920 
milliards d’euros à fin septembre 2017). Il y a certes les produits d’assurance-vie en 
unités de compte, dont la collecte brute a progressé récemment (+ 36 milliards euros 
à fin 2017) mais qui ne sont pas exempts de limites : les flux peuvent être 
procycliques – c’est ce qui s’est passé très concrètement lors de la dernière crise, 
avec des retraits rapides qui ont aggravé la chute du CAC 40 –, et, surtout, ces 
produits n’offrent pas de protection en capital, et je rappelle ici le devoir de conseil 
des professionnels sur les risques réellement pris par les assurés, particulièrement 
en phase haute du cycle boursier. De l’autre côté, Eurocroissance était une bonne 
idée mais nous devons en constater le démarrage décevant, avec seulement un peu 
plus de 2 milliards d’euros d’encours actuellement.     
Essayons de poser le problème des produits plus largement, en partant des attentes 
des Français. Les épargnants français sont certes très attachés aux placements 
sûrs, mais le débat gagnerait à mieux distinguer deux composantes de cette 
recherche de sécurité : les Français sont davantage attachés à la protection du 
capital qu’à la liquidité, car ils sont de plus en plus orientés vers le long terme du fait 
notamment de la nécessité de préparer leur retraite. Il est donc bienvenu que les 
professionnels commencent à imaginer aujourd’hui une assurance-vie de long terme, 
moins liquide, mais assortie d’une forme de protection du capital, et significativement 
investie en actions. Le ministre en a fait une des propositions très positives du Plan 
d’action pour la croissance et la transformation des entreprises (Pacte) ; le législateur  
s’en saisira cette année. Ceci profitera aussi aux épargnants qui bénéficieront du 
rendement plus élevé des actions dans la durée. [slide 7] À titre d’illustration, sur 40 
ans en France, le rendement cumulé des actions a été plus de trois fois supérieur à 
celui du livret A, et s’est également situé au-dessus des rendements obligataires 
(souverains).  
2) C’est aux professionnels de concevoir les bons produits, mais les pouvoirs 
publics et les régulateurs ont également un rôle à jouer pour encourager leur 
développement.  
Page 4 sur 5 
 
Du côté de la Banque de France et de l’ACPR, nous veillons à ce que le cadre 
réglementaire soit stable et propice au bon financement de notre économie. Pour ce 
qui concerne les banques, les « règles du jeu » du financement ont été stabilisées 
grâce à l’accord final sur la réforme de Bâle 3 que nous avons conclu en décembre. 
Et je le dis fort et clair ici : tous les secteurs-clés de l’économie française resteront 
totalement financés avec Bâle 3, de l’immobilier aux PME, en passant par les grands 
projets d’investissement. La régulation n’entraîne aujourd’hui aucune contrainte 
limitant l’offre de crédit en France.  
Pour les assurances, nous suivons de près la revue européenne de Solvabilité II. Sur 
bien des points, ce nouveau cadre réglementaire est une avancée très importante, 
mais nous devons, avec la participation active des professionnels, analyser de près 
ses impacts, en particulier sur les comportements d’investissement (notamment en 
actions) et le financement de l’économie, pour pouvoir proposer des ajustements si 
nécessaire dans les deux revues de 2018 et 2020.  
Le succès des nouveaux produits d’épargne suppose aussi d’éviter les distorsions 
fiscales en faveur de l’épargne sans risque, et de sortir progressivement de la 
multiplicité des niches. Le PFU participe de cette neutralité vis-à-vis des différentes 
formes d’épargne, souhaitable depuis longtemps. Je lis certaines réflexions des 
banques sur un nouveau produit long à leur bilan : pourquoi pas, mais il ne peut pas 
s’agir d’une nouvelle niche fiscale sur l’épargne ; nous avons abusé de cette 
intéressante spécificité hexagonale. La neutralité fiscale devrait idéalement se 
retrouver aussi du côté des entreprises financées pour ne pas pénaliser le 
financement par fonds propres plutôt que par endettement : ce chantier est 
évidemment plus lourd, et ce biais se retrouve malheureusement dans presque tous 
les pays.  
Le défi du financement appelle enfin une réponse européenne : je plaide pour une 
« Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation », qui mobilise 
mieux les 350 milliards d’euros d’épargne européenne excédentaire au service des 
fonds propres et de l’innovation, digitale ou énergétique. Elle réunirait et amplifierait 
l’Union bancaire, l’Union des marchés de capitaux et le plan Juncker.  
**

Je veux terminer par une réflexion plus générale. Au-delà des mesures techniques 
que j’ai évoquées, ce meilleur financement de notre économie ne se fera pas sans 
l’amélioration de l’information et des connaissances des Français en matière 
financière. Tant qu’on pourra vendre des illusions sur le bitcoin et autres crypto-
actifs, on ne fera guère avancer le financement de l’investissement productif. Les 
professionnels ont le devoir de bien éclairer leurs clients sur la nature des 
investissements réalisés, et sur les risques qu’ils comportent : l’ACPR et l’AMF y 
veillent. Mais les Français doivent aussi être mieux formés et informés pour faire 
leurs choix de placements financiers en toute connaissance de cause, et être à 
même, s’ils le souhaitent, de prendre davantage de risques raisonnés. Je suis très 
heureux que le Premier ministre y ait insisté tout à l’heure. La Banque de France, en 
tant qu’opérateur de l’éducation économique et financière des publics, à la demande 
des ministres de l’Économie et des Finances comme de l’Éducation nationale, est 
pleinement engagée dans cette démarche, avec l’appui de tous ses partenaires – 
associations, acteurs institutionnels et professionnels. Ce sera une de nos priorités 
en 2018. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
J’aimerais tout d’abord féliciter la Banque centrale d’Irlande à l’occasion du 
75
e
 anniversaire de sa création et, plus particulièrement, mon collègue et ami, 
le gouverneur Philip Lane. Je suis très heureux de participer à cette 
conférence consacrée à la « mondialisation financière », en compagnie 
d’intervenants et d’experts d’une telle qualité.  
Je souhaiterais partager avec vous quelques réflexions relatives aux 
déséquilibres des comptes courants à l’échelle mondiale ; j’aborderai cette 
question du point de vue de la politique économique. Les faits stylisés sont 
bien connus, donc je ne m’y attarderai pas [diapo 2]. À partir de la fin des 
années 1990, l’économie mondiale a été caractérisée par une montée très 
importante des déséquilibres des comptes de transactions courantes à 
l’échelle mondiale. En dépit d’un processus de rééquilibrage et de 
mouvements de court terme essentiellement liés aux prix des matières 
premières, processus qui a débuté avec la Grande récession en 2008-2009, 
ces déséquilibres sont demeurés importants et persistants. En conséquence, 
les positions extérieures nettes ont continué d’augmenter [diapo 3]. La zone 
euro est une des régions dans laquelle ces évolutions ont été particulièrement 
marquantes [diapo 4]. En dépit d’un rééquilibrage des comptes courants en 
Italie et en Espagne, des déséquilibres persistent encore, en raison 
essentiellement d’importants excédents en Allemagne et aux Pays-Bas.  
Pourquoi devrions-nous nous soucier de ces déséquilibres ? Après tout, 
dans la mesure où ces déséquilibres reflètent simplement le besoin de 
financement de la consommation et de l’investissement actuels et futurs, tous 
les pays du monde ne doivent pas tous présenter en permanence une 
situation d’équilibre. Toutefois, lorsqu’ils ont excessifs, les déséquilibres 
extérieurs peuvent devenir une source de préoccupation car le 
financement des pays en situation de déficit par les pays en situation 
d’excédent peut s’interrompre brutalement, voire s’inverser
ii
. L’expérience 
montre que les déséquilibres importants sont souvent un indicateur avancé 
 
 
2 
 
des crises et des interruptions brutales de flux de financements (sudden 
stops). Comme le montre Philip Lane dans une de ses nombreuses 
contributions sur le sujet 
iii
, avant la Grande crise financière, les soldes des 
transactions courantes dépassaient les niveaux compatibles avec les 
fondamentaux économiques, ce qui a nécessité, par la suite, des ajustements 
importants et coûteux. Ces vulnérabilités ne sont pas circonscrites aux 
économies de marché émergentes : des déficits courants importants et 
persistants peuvent également précéder les crises financières dans les 
économies avancées
iv
, y compris dans la zone euro. 
La suite de mon propos est structurée de la manière suivante. Premièrement, 
je parlerai des déterminants du compte des transactions courantes, et plus 
particulièrement du rôle du taux de change. Dans une deuxième partie, je dirai 
quelques mots au sujet de la composition du financement externe (flux de 
capitaux bruts et nets). Enfin, je concluerai par une discussion sur les 
options de politique économique, qui seraient susceptibles de remédier à la 
persistance des déséquilibres courants, aussi bien à l’échelle mondiale qu’au 
sein de la zone euro.  
** 
1. Les déterminants des déséquilibres mondiaux et leurs mécanismes 
d’ajustement 
Le coût économique et social d’une correction des déséquilibres des comptes 
courants peut être considérable. La question des effets macroéconomiques 
d’un transfert de ressources des pays débiteurs vers les pays créanciers est 
un vieux problème qui remonte au débat entre Keynes et Ohlin sur les 
engagements internationaux de l’Allemagne après la Première Guerre 
mondiale. Au cours des dernières décennies, Maury Obstfeld et Ken Rogoff 
v
 
ont indiqué dans une série d’articles que le mécanisme de base de 
l’ajustement impliquait le transfert de ressources réelles des pays débiteurs 
vers les pays en excédent, indépendamment des facteurs à l’origine du 
rééquilibrage mondial.  
 
 
3 
 
Pour le pays débiteur, il y a clairement un coût macroéconomique lié à la 
baisse des dépenses intérieures et à la détérioration de la richesse, entraînant 
d’importants écarts de production négatifs et des taux de chômage élevés, ce 
qui exerce une forte pression à la baisse sur les salaires. C’est typiquement ce 
que nous avons observé dans la zone euro, où l’ajustement a contribué à la 
dynamique très différente des coûts unitaires de main-d’œuvre d’un pays à 
l’autre [diapo 5], aboutissant ainsi à des ajustements de prix relatifs. En termes 
cumulés depuis 2007, l’Allemagne a enregistré une appréciation de quelque 
8 % du taux de change réel par rapport à la France, et de 20 % par rapport à 
l’Espagne, bien que nous devions prendre en compte dans cette dynamique 
les importants gains de compétitivité constatés en Allemagne avant la crise. 
L’ajustement a consisté essentiellement en un ajustement nominal dans les 
pays en situation de déficit.  
La relation entre compte des transactions courantes et taux de change 
réel fait encore l’objet de nombreux débats dans les milieux académiques. 
Prenons un simple graphique de dispersion montrant la relation entre les 
variations du compte courant et celles du taux de change réel depuis le début 
des années 2000 [diapo 6], la conclusion est plutôt pessimiste : au cours de 
cette période, les variations annuelles du taux de change réel n’ont affiché 
qu’une faible relation négative avec les ajustements du compte courant. On 
peut avancer qu’un rééquilibrage nécessite d’importantes variations du taux de 
change réel et entraîne, par conséquent, des coûts importants en termes de 
niveau de richesse pour les pays en déficit. En outre, cette relation peut 
sensiblement différer entre les périodes d’« accumulation » des déséquilibres 
à l’échelle mondiale et celles de « rééquilibrage ». Si l’on divise l’échantillon 
entre la période qui précède et celle qui suit le « pic » de ces déséquilibres 
mondiaux en 2006 [diapo 7], on constate en effet clairement une 
asymétrie : les variations des comptes courants ont été plus fortement liées 
aux mouvements du taux de change réel durant les quatre années qui ont 
suivi le « pic » des déséquilibres mondiaux (période de rééquilibrage) que 
durant les quatre années qui l’ont précédé (période d’accumulation). Il existe 
 
 
4 
 
de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles cette relation pourrait évoluer avec le 
temps : par exemple, il a été montré, du côté des exportations, que les 
exportateurs très productifs réagissaient moins fortement aux mouvements du 
taux de change réel que les petits exportateurs moins productifs
vi
. Cela signifie 
que lorsqu’il y a un besoin de rééquilibrage, celui-ci s’effectue dans une large 
mesure par le biais des importations et, dans les pays en déficit, par une 
compression de la demande. 
 
2. Le financement des déséquilibres importants  
Permettez-moi maintenant d’aborder l’aspect financier du compte courant et 
d’analyser le caractère soutenable d’un déséquilibre courant excessif, 
principalement à partir du niveau et de la composition du financement.  
Les déséquilibres importants du compte courant, en particulier les déficits, 
posent des risques importants pour la soutenabilité de la dette extérieure et 
font apparaître la possibilité d’interruptions brutales (sudden stops)
vii
. Les 
positions brutes sont aujourd’hui 3 à 4 fois plus élevées qu’en 1995, au sein 
d’une fourchette comprise entre 150 et 300 % du PIB (150 % dans le cas des 
États-Unis et 300 % dans le cas de la France, par exemple). Les positions 
nettes sont beaucoup moins élevées [diapo 8, tableau de la partie droite], mais 
ont été multipliés par un facteur de 5 à 10 par rapport à leur niveau de 1995. 
L’existence d’importants déséquilibres persistants des comptes courants a 
pour contrepartie des positions extérieures nettes élevées [comme cela a déjà 
été montré dans la diapo 3], mais aussi l’accumulation persistante d’avoirs et 
d’engagements extérieurs.  
À cet égard, la composition du compte financier (IDE, investissements de 
portefeuille ainsi que la catégorie des autres investissements qui recouvre 
dans une large mesure les flux bancaires) est importante. Si l’on examine les 
différents instruments financiers, on constate que la volatilité de l’ensemble 
des flux résulte dans une large mesure des flux bancaires [diapo 9]. Étant 
 
 
5 
 
donné la forte expansion des flux bancaires transfrontières avant la crise, en 
particulier dans la zone euro, le « faible » niveau observé ces dernières 
années pourrait simplement être interprété comme un retour à la normale. En 
effet, à la suite de la Grande crise financière, ce sont les flux bancaires qui ont 
le plus diminué, suivis des flux sur portefeuilles de titres de dette
viii
. Les flux 
sur portefeuilles d’actions ont beaucoup mieux résisté que les flux sur titres de 
dette, qui ont diminué de moitié entre la période antérieure à la crise et celle 
postérieure à la crise. La résilience des flux sur actions montre que les actions 
ont de meilleures propriétés de partage du risque que les titres de dette
ix
. 
Par conséquent, même si d’importantes mesures sont prises pour réduire les 
soldes commerciaux (parfois à un coût élevé), la manière dont ces déficits 
courants ont été financés continue d’influer sur les déséquilibres actuels et 
futurs des comptes courants, limitant ainsi l’efficience d’un rééquilibrage de la 
demande. Les effets de valorisation et les flux de revenus sont les facteurs qui 
déterminent de plus en plus les positions extérieures nettes, davantage que le 
solde commercial lui-même [diapo 10]. Cela implique de garder un œil vigilant 
sur les types de flux financiers qui financent les déséquilibres des comptes 
courants, et de surveiller la contribution relative des flux d’IDE, d’actions, de 
titres de dette et des flux bancaires à l’accumulation des déséquilibres 
extérieurs ainsi que l’exposition au risque de change, du point de vue aussi 
bien des avoirs que des engagements. 
 
3. Donc, quelles sont les réponses de politique économique 
envisageables pour limiter les déséquilibres mondiaux excessifs ? 
Permettez-moi de commencer par mettre l’accent sur ce que seraient des 
réponses inadéquates. Premièrement, il y a la tentation du protectionnisme, 
mais ce n’est pas une option. D’un point de vue macroéconomique, un 
renforcement du protectionnisme a des effets récessionnistes et 
inflationnistes, car il agit comme un choc d’offre négatif. De plus, le compte 
des transactions courantes étant déterminé par l’équilibre entre épargne et 
 
 
6 
 
investissement, il ne semble pas évident que les politiques commerciales 
soient susceptibles d’affecter les deux variables. Par exemple, en raison de 
l’intégration croissante des chaînes de valeur mondiales, toute augmentation 
des droits de douane sur les consommations intermédiaires importées se 
traduit immédiatement par une hausse des coûts de production et nuit, en 
conséquence, à la compétitivité à l’exportation. Ainsi, imposer de nouvelles 
barrières commerciales – ou des « accords bilatéraux » – à certains 
partenaires commerciaux n’a non seulement presque aucune chance 
d’éliminer le déficit global du compte des transactions courantes, mais menace 
en outre la croissance économique à long terme. 
De même, il serait également illusoire pour les différents pays de mener des 
politiques macroéconomiques non-coopératives. Premièrement, les 
dévaluations compétitives : après des déclarations unilatérales et 
malencontreuses entendues la semaine dernière, plusieurs d’entre nous, 
membres du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, ont jugé nécessaire de 
rappeler qu’au cours de la dernière Assemblée annuelle du FMI qui s’est 
tenue à Washington en octobre, nous nous sommes engagés, avec 
l’ensemble de nos partenaires, à adopter une approche multilatérale en 
affirmant que, je cite, « nous n’établirons pas de cible de taux de change à des 
fins de concurrence ». Tout écart par rapport à cette règle commune ne se 
ferait qu’au prix de la confiance mutuelle et de la croissance mondiale.  
À propos du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, permettez-moi de dire 
quelques mots sur notre politique monétaire. Elle suit, avec confiance et 
patience,  une voie de normalisation progressive. Mais l’on ne devrait pas se 
concentrer de façon excessive sur le seul instrument des achats mensuels 
nets d’actifs : que nous y mettions un terme en septembre ou que nous les 
diminuions un peu plus progressivement n’est pas une question 
« existentielle »... Il y a deux autres questions plus importantes : 
- premièrement, comme en danse irlandaise, nous préférons danser en 
quadrille plutôt qu’en solo ; ici, nous nous appuierons de plus en plus sur 
 
 
7 
 
l’ensemble des mesures de politique monétaire, qui incluent le volume 
considérable d’actifs déjà acquis, les réinvestissements à venir et les 
indications sur la trajectoire future des taux d’intérêt directeurs (forward 
guidance). Et nous suivrons une séquence prévisible. 
- deuxièmement, le calendrier de cette séquence dépendra des 
perspectives d’inflation et des progrès réalisés sur la voie de notre 
objectif de taux d’inflation inférieur à mais proche de 2 %. En 
conséquence, nous surveillerons la transmission des variations du taux 
de change – qui constitue une source d’incertitude – et nous serons prêts 
à réévaluer les choses si nécessaire. 
Des dévaluations budgétaires ont également été envisagées par les pays 
cherchant à doper leur compétitivité par le biais de modifications de leur 
système fiscal, généralement en réduisant la fiscalité du travail et/ou du 
capital, tout en accroissant les taxes sur la consommation
x
. Ces modifications 
accroissent la compétitivité des entreprises nationales par rapport aux 
entreprises étrangères, tant sur les marchés intérieurs qu’à l’exportation. En 
pratique, toutefois, il y a des limites empiriques à cette stratégie. Un 
nivellement par le bas des taux d’imposition des sociétés soulève également 
des défis croissants concernant l’équité sociale de la mondialisation – et donc 
sa soutenabilité – comme l’a souligné le président Macron à Davos... et 
comme il ressort parfois même des débats au sujet de l’Irlande. 
Des recherches récentes ont mis l’accent sur l’influence notable que les 
politiques budgétaires peuvent exercer sur l’évolution des déséquilibres, y 
compris aux États-Unis et en Allemagne
xi
. À cet égard, la réforme fiscale 
américaine récemment adoptée par le Congrès devrait considérablement 
stimuler l’économie américaine, qui se trouve déjà en situation de plein emploi, 
entraînant ainsi une hausse des importations et un creusement du déficit 
extérieur. Cela risque donc clairement d’accroître les déséquilibres mondiaux. 
Symétriquement, au sein de la zone euro, certains pays dont les soldes des 
transactions courantes sont largement positifs ont récemment réalisé des 
excédents budgétaires (par exemple, en 2017, 0,9 % du PIB en Allemagne 
 
 
8 
 
et 0,7 % aux Pays-Bas). Cela suggère qu’une stimulation budgétaire dans ces 
pays pourrait contribuer à corriger les déséquilibres intra-zone euro, que ce 
soit par le biais des dépenses d’investissement public ou de réductions de la 
fiscalité des ménages. 
Donc, quelle est la solution ? Plus que jamais, un multilatéralisme actif est 
aujourd’hui nécessaire pour relever nos défis mondiaux. Dans le monde 
incertain qui est le nôtre en 2018, il est de la responsabilité d’une Europe forte, 
ainsi que du Canada et de certains partenaires asiatiques, de porter ce 
message.  
Je voudrais conclure en m’attachant au niveau intra-européen. La zone euro 
enregistre un excédent d’épargne par rapport à l’investissement qui devrait 
s’établir autour de 3,0 % du PIB en 2017. L’épargne devrait circuler plus 
librement en Europe, en direction des besoins d’investissement, en 
particulier vers l’investissement productif, et une façon notable de parvenir à 
ce résultat est de renforcer les fonds propres, qui sont la clé d’une économie 
d’innovation. Une grande partie de la solution se situe au niveau européen, 
avec la construction de ce que j’appelle une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation » (UFII), qui regrouperait les initiatives déjà 
en place – l’« Union des marchés de capitaux » bien sûr, mais aussi l’Union 
bancaire et le Plan Juncker. Au Conseil des gouverneurs, nous trouvons tous 
regrettable que l’Union des marchés de capitaux soit actuellement traitée en 
parent pauvre dans les discussions politiques concernant le renforcement de 
la zone euro. L’Union des marchés de capitaux contribuerait de façon 
significative à favoriser le partage du risque privé : 
(i) premièrement, en incitant aux investissements transfrontières – de 
préférence en fonds propres – par le biais de l’harmonisation des règles 
comptables, de la fiscalité et des lois sur la faillite ; 
(ii) deuxièmement, en développant à l’échelle européenne des produits 
d’épargne davantage orientés vers les investissements à long terme. 
 
 
9 
 
Cela pourrait être réalisé par le biais de différents véhicules d’épargne, à 
commencer par la création de fonds de capital-risque européens ; 
(iii) troisièmement, en achevant l’Union bancaire. 
** 
En conclusion, les déséquilibres mondiaux ne sont pas inévitables et nous 
avons toujours besoin de nouvelles idées pour améliorer le fonctionnement de 
nos économies mondialisées. À cet égard, je voudrais citer George Bernard 
Shaw, le célèbre écrivain irlandais, qui a dit « Vous voyez des choses et vous 
dites Pourquoi?’ Mais moi, je rêve de choses qui n’ont jamais existé ; et je dis 
‘Pourquoi pas ?’ » Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Monsieur le Premier Ministre,  
Messieurs les Ministres,  
Madame la Ministre,  
Monsieur le Dr. Theo Waigel,  
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un honneur pour moi de m’exprimer ce soir, après mon compatriote sarrois le Ministre 
des Finances Peter Altmaier. Je suis 100 % Français, mais avec mes racines familiales 
depuis deux siècles en Allemagne… et je dois même vous avouer que le Dr Altmaier est le 
député de ma ville de Saarlouis. Mais honneur ici à Munich à la Bavière, et je remercie le Dr 
Theo Waigel pour son invitation. Dr Waigel, vous avez joué un grand rôle dans la 
construction de notre monnaie européenne. Je veux reprendre les mots que vous avez 
prononcés devant le Bundestag en avril 1998, en prévision du passage à la troisième phase 
de notre Union économique et monétaire : « Après deux guerres mondiales dévastatrices et 
douloureuses, le projet Europe ouvre à nos enfants et petits-enfants des opportunités dont 
nos pères et nos mères, nos ancêtres, n'auraient jamais osé rêver »
i
. Vingt ans plus tard, 
nous pouvons dire que l’union monétaire est un succès : 74 % des citoyens de la zone euro 
soutiennent l’euro et ce chiffre atteint même 81 % en Allemagne. L’union économique, par 
contre, est encore sous-développée. C’est un problème pour deux raisons. D’abord, parce 
que le cycle économique actuel prendra fin à un moment, même s’il est aujourd’hui très 
solide. Si d’ici là nous ne nous dotons pas d’instruments économiques plus forts, la politique 
monétaire risque d’être trop sollicitée. C’est une préoccupation allemande que je partage 
entièrement en tant que banquier central ; mais je dis à nos amis allemands que, pour cette 
raison même, ils doivent souhaiter le renforcement de l’union économique. Ensuite, parce 
que l’absence de véritable union économique ralentit la zone euro, alors même que nous 
devons combler notre retard de croissance passé, notamment par rapport aux États-Unis, et 
faire face au bouleversement technologique. Le thème de cette soirée est « de nouvelles 
idées pour l’Europe ». Mais pour avoir de nouvelles idées, il faut commencer par s’affranchir 
des vieux clichés qui paralysent le débat. C’est ce que je ferai dans un premier temps, avant 
de vous présenter mes trois idées nouvelles pour l’Europe. 
** 
1. Trois vieux clichés dont il faut s’affranchir  
Un premier vieux cliché refait surface lorsque l’on parle de la réforme de la zone euro : l’idée 
– paresseuse – selon laquelle l’union économique serait un substitut aux réformes 
nationales. Je veux le redire d’emblée : les réformes nationales sont au contraire une 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
condition préalable à tout renforcement de l’union économique, et la France en est 
aujourd’hui bien consciente. Je le dis en tant que banquier central totalement indépendant : 
le nouveau gouvernement prend les réformes très au sérieux et agit avec une rapidité 
impressionnante. L’Europe et l’Allemagne disposent désormais, avec la France, d’un 
partenaire économique fiable.  
Ensuite, il serait caricatural de réduire le débat à une vieille opposition entre les « règles 
allemandes » et les « dépenses françaises ». Il n’est pas question à mes yeux de mettre 
en place une « union de transferts » qui ne profiterait qu’à certains pays, ni des eurobonds 
qui reviendraient à mutualiser les dettes. Est-il besoin de rappeler que la France est aussi un 
pays contributeur net au budget européen, ou au financement de la Grèce ? Mais je suis 
convaincu que le partage des risques entre les pays peut – et doit – aller de pair avec des 
mécanismes de réduction des risques. L’opposition entre solidarité et responsabilité est 
fausse, car il y a en réalité une complémentarité : la prévention crédible des crises nécessite 
aussi de disposer d’instruments pour amortir les effets des chocs importants qui peuvent 
malgré tout se produire.  
Troisième cliché, cessons d’opposer vision française et pragmatisme allemand. Pour 
réformer la zone euro, il faut, sur le fond, partir des besoins réels et notamment ceux des 
entreprises et entrepreneurs – c’est ce que je tâcherai de faire dans ma seconde partie. 
Comme le disait Helmut Schmidt dès 1978, « les citoyens de l'Europe attendent que soient 
résolues des tâches concrètes. »
ii
 Pour autant, nous avons besoin d’une ambition politique 
pour agir – appelez cela « vision » si vous voulez. Nous en avons besoin car c’est 
maintenant ou jamais qu’il faut avancer : avec l’embellie économique, avec les premières 
propositions du Président Macron à la Sorbonne et le chapitre européen du contrat de 
coalition en Allemagne – je ne ferai bien évidemment pas de commentaire au sujet du reste 
–, nous avons sur la table des conditions historiquement favorables. Si nous n’agissons pas 
en 2018, d’abord Français et Allemands, et ensuite tous les 19 pays membres de la zone 
euro, nous n’avancerons jamais.  
 
2. Comment renforcer la zone euro ? Trois idées nouvelles  
J’en viens à mes trois idées nouvelles pour renforcer la zone euro. Pour avancer en Europe, 
il faut d’abord partir des besoins réels d’investissement des entreprises, et des 
ressources dont nous disposons. Du côté des besoins, la clé de la croissance aujourd’hui 
en zone euro est sans conteste l’innovation. La Chancelière Angela Merkel l’a rappelé à 
Davos il y a trois semaines et les entreprises bavaroises sont bien placées pour le savoir. En 
50 ans, la Bavière a su transformer radicalement son économie en faisant ce pari de 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
l’innovation. Mais pour innover, sur le digital, sur la transition énergétique par exemple, les 
entreprises doivent être capables de prendre davantage de risques ; ceci nécessite plus de 
financement par fonds propres, sur le long terme, plutôt que du financement par la dette. 
Dans ce domaine, la zone euro est très en retard : les fonds propres représentaient 
seulement 73 % du PIB en 2017, contre 123 % aux États-Unis. Du côté des ressources 
maintenant, transformons ce qui est souvent un débat difficile – sur les excédents allemands 
importants – en atout positif : nous avons en zone euro une épargne abondante. Pour faire 
se rencontrer ces ressources et ces besoins, je propose au niveau européen une « Union 
de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » qui mobilise mieux les 350 
milliards d’euros d’épargne excédentaire au service des fonds propres et de l’innovation, 
digitale ou énergétique. Cette Union doit rassembler les initiatives existantes, et d’abord 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux, mais aussi l’Union bancaire et le plan d’investissement 
Juncker. L’Union des marchés de capitaux requiert des progrès concrets dans plusieurs 
domaines : la révision des règles comptables, de la fiscalité et des lois de faillite pour faciliter 
l’investissement transfrontière, notamment en fonds propres ; la création de produits 
d’épargne pan-européens de long terme. Au Conseil des gouverneurs et avec mon collègue 
le Président Jens Weidmann, nous trouvons tous très regrettable que l’Union des marchés 
de capitaux soit actuellement oubliée dans les discussions politiques concernant le 
renforcement de la zone euro.  
Ma deuxième idée pour avancer en Europe est de partir de la qualité des dépenses 
publiques, pour donner la priorité à l’investissement et aux dépenses d’avenir. Nous nous 
sommes jusqu’à présent surtout souciés de « quantités », et un mot à ce propos sur le Pacte 
de stabilité et de croissance : il serait à mes yeux à la fois dangereux et illusoire de vouloir 
changer les règles ; respectons-les plutôt. Mais nous devons nous interroger en parallèle sur 
la qualité des dépenses publiques : pour augmenter notre croissance potentielle, à long 
terme, les dépenses d’investissement et d’avenir sont indispensables, y compris dans 
l’éducation et la formation et bien-sûr les nouvelles technologies. C’est vrai dans les budgets 
nationaux, mais nous pourrions en amplifier l’effet par un budget d’investissement de la zone 
euro. Ce budget servirait à financer, au bénéfice de tous les pays, certains « biens 
communs » dont le numérique, la transition énergétique, la sécurité et la protection de nos 
frontières extérieures. 
Enfin, ma troisième idée part d’une question : comment traiter la stabilisation ? Autrement 
dit, comment faire face à des chocs qui affectent brutalement certaines économies 
nationales ? Le partage du risque privé avec l’Union des marchés de capitaux et l’Union de 
financement dont j’ai parlé est une partie de la réponse. Aux États-Unis par exemple, le 
marché boursier est capable d’amortir environ 40 % d’un choc spécifique à un État. Mais 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
cela ne suffit pas. Nous devons absolument aller plus loin. Sinon, la politique monétaire 
risque d’être surchargée lors d’une prochaine récession, ce qui serait dangereux – 
« monetary policy should not be the only game in town ». En zone euro, nous avons donc 
besoin d’une meilleure coordination des politiques économiques. Celles-ci resteront avant 
tout nationales, mais nous pouvons viser une meilleure stratégie économique collective, 
avec davantage de réformes dans les pays où elles sont nécessaires, et avec davantage de 
soutien budgétaire ou salarial dans les pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre. Cette 
stratégie collective pourrait être complétée par un renforcement du Mécanisme européen de 
stabilité en Fonds monétaire européen ; la condition est que ses missions soient élargies à 
un véritable rôle de prévention des crises, et que sa gouvernance soit modifiée. Sinon ce 
serait un simple changement de façade.  
** 
Pour conclure, je veux mentionner une autre raison pour laquelle 2018 doit être l’année de 
l’Europe : c’est notre environnement extérieur, avec la perspective du Brexit et la présidence 
de M. Trump aux États-Unis. Face aux enjeux de la mondialisation, l’Europe est porteuse 
d’un double message qui est essentiel. Tout d’abord, notre modèle social commun – die 
Soziale Marktwirtschaft – combine un haut niveau de service public, des inégalités 
relativement faibles et une forte intensité du dialogue social ; il est la bonne réponse au 
débat sur les inégalités qui revient au premier plan. Ensuite, notre engagement pour le 
multilatéralisme est indispensable face à la tentation protectionniste. Nous devons 
résolument défendre, avec le Canada et certains partenaires asiatiques,  des règles et des 
institutions multilatérales respectées de tous. Le monde a aujourd’hui besoin d’une Europe 
plus forte. Il est donc temps que nous, Européens, prenions notre destin en main.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
Pour assurer la pérennité de l’Union monétaire européenne à moyen terme, nous devons la 
rendre plus résiliente aux futures crises. Certes, le cycle économique actuel est très solide, 
mais cela ne durera pas toujours. Si nous voulons éviter de surcharger la politique monétaire 
lors de la prochaine récession, nous devons renforcer notre Union économique. Ces 
objectifs doivent constituer, y compris ici en Allemagne, les deux faces d’une même 
médaille. Afin d’assurer que la politique monétaire ne reste pas la seule partie à jouer (the 
only game in town), nous devons nous armer en nous dotant d’instruments économiques 
plus robustes au niveau européen. Cependant, au risque de manquer des occasions, le 
débat actuel sur l’avenir de la zone euro semble s’enliser dans des discussions sans fin, 
comme celles sur le système européen de garantie des dépôts (EDIS) ou la restructuration 
des dettes souveraines. Nous devrions plutôt concentrer nos efforts sur les nombreuses 
autres propositions qui sont plus consensuelles [slide]. Dans mes remarques aujourd’hui, je 
détaillerai les trois vieux clichés qui paralysent le débat et que nous devons dépasser pour 
faire progresser la zone euro. Mais avant cela, permettez-moi de dire quelques mots sur 
notre politique monétaire. 
** 
Grâce à sa persistance et à sa patience, notre politique monétaire fait sa part du travail, 
comme l’a souligné Mario Draghi ce matin. Les questions soulevées dans le passé 
concernant tant son efficacité que notre stratégie possible de sortie ont apparemment perdu 
de leur intensité, et cela à juste titre. Nous avons confirmé la semaine dernière notre 
trajectoire de normalisation progressive, avec le retrait du prétendu « biais accommodant » 
sur l’APP.  Nous observons actuellement un alignement des étoiles bienvenu : dans le 
contexte économique d’une expansion robuste et de  progrès graduels de l’inflation, il existe 
une large convergence des anticipations de marché avec les vues exprimées au sein de 
notre Conseil des gouverneurs. À l’heure actuelle,  il n’existe que très peu de débat parmi 
nous. Mais cette convergence n’exclut pas la vigilance. Nous observons attentivement le 
rythme relativement lent de l’inflation – je crois que la courbe de Phillips est encore à 
l’œuvre, quoiqu’avec un certain retard – et les risques mondiaux, à commencer par la 
politique commerciale américaine et l’évolution du taux de change.  
Permettez-moi d’aborder maintenant le cœur de mon message : la nécessité de renforcer 
notre Union monétaire en réalisant des progrès concrets sur l’Union économique. Il existe 
actuellement une fenêtre d’opportunité : la reprise économique est robuste, et de 
nombreuses propositions de réforme de la zone euro vont dans la même direction, 
notamment la feuille de route de la Commission de décembre 2017, le discours du président 
Page 2 de 5 
 
Macron à la Sorbonne en septembre dernier et, plus récemment, le chapitre européen de 
l’accord de coalition en Allemagne. Les résultats des récentes élections en Italie montrent 
que nous ne pouvons plus perdre de temps avec des débats théoriques. Notre rôle de 
banquiers centraux est de formuler des propositions, mais évidemment, la responsabilité de 
l’action incombe aux hommes politiques. 
1/ Le premier cliché qui surgit lorsqu’on parle de réformer la zone euro est l’opposition 
entre vision – qu’elle soit française ou autre – et pragmatisme – considéré comme une 
vertu du nord de l’Europe. Nous devons être concrets et prendre comme point de départ les 
besoins réels, et notamment ceux des entreprises et des entrepreneurs. En même temps, il 
nous faut une ambition politique pour agir (appelez cela une « vision » si vous le souhaitez). 
Aujourd’hui, l’investissement et l’innovation constituent la clé de la croissance dans la zone 
euro. Mais pour innover, sur le digital, ou sur la transition énergétique par exemple, les 
entreprises doivent être capables de prendre davantage de risques, ce qui nécessite plus de 
financement par fonds propres, sur le long terme, plutôt que du financement par la dette. 
Dans ce domaine, la zone euro est très en retard : les fonds propres représentaient 
seulement 73 % du PIB au troisième trimestre 2017, contre 123 % aux États-Unis. Ce 
constat m’amène à une première solution en vue de renforcer notre Union économique : une 
« Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » au niveau européen, qui 
mobiliserait mieux les 350 milliards d’euros d’épargne européenne excédentaire au service 
des fonds propres pour l’innovation, dans le digital ou les énergies renouvelables. Cette 
Union doit rassembler les initiatives existantes et d’abord, l’Union des marchés de capitaux, 
mais aussi l’Union bancaire et le plan d’investissement Juncker. 
Il n’existe aucun obstacle politique sérieux à ce programme relativement technique. Au sein 
du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, nous trouvons tous très regrettable que l’Union des 
marchés de capitaux soit actuellement oubliée et nous avons appelé jeudi dernier à prendre 
des « mesures spécifiques et décisives » dans ce domaine.  
2/ Le deuxième cliché est l’idée complaisante selon laquelle l’action au niveau européen 
serait un substitut aux réformes nationales. J’affirme au contraire que les réformes 
nationales sont une condition préalable à tout renforcement de l’Union économique, et la 
France en est bien consciente. Je le dis en tant que banquier central totalement 
indépendant : le nouveau gouvernement mène les réformes structurelles avec une rapidité 
impressionnante. Les réformes nationales sont nécessaires mais elles ne sont pas 
suffisantes, car notre défi est le suivant : comment assurer la stabilisation et une meilleure 
allocation des ressources à l’échelle de la zone euro ? En ce qui concerne la stabilisation, je 
vois deux pistes. Premièrement, une meilleure stratégie économique collective au sein de 
la zone euro. Les États membres sont responsables de leurs politiques économiques, mais 
Page 3 de 5 
 
la zone euro a vraiment besoin de davantage de réformes dans les pays où elles sont 
nécessaires, comme la France, et de davantage de soutien budgétaire ou salarial dans les 
pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre, comme l’Allemagne ou les Pays-Bas. 
Deuxièmement, un instrument de précaution axé sur la stabilité afin non seulement de 
gérer les crises ex post, mais également de les prévenir ex ante. Cet instrument existe déjà, 
en théorie, dans la boîte à outils du MES, sous la forme de l’« Assistance financière à titre de 
précaution ». Il n’a cependant jamais été utilisé et pourrait probablement être amélioré, avec 
des règles claires et une forme de système de préqualification automatique, afin d’éviter tout 
effet de stigmatisation. Ce renforcement des instruments de prévention des crises pourrait 
faire partie d’une transformation plus large du MES et de sa gouvernance au sein d’un Fonds 
monétaire européen (FME).  
La question de l’allocation des ressources doit également être traitée sérieusement. Afin 
de stimuler la croissance potentielle à long terme, les dépenses d’investissement et d’avenir 
sont indispensables, y compris dans l’éducation et la formation et, bien-sûr, les nouvelles 
technologies. C’est vrai dans les budgets nationaux, mais nous pourrions en amplifier l’effet 
par un budget d’investissement de la zone euro. Ce budget servirait à financer, au 
bénéfice de tous les États membres de la zone euro, certains « biens communs » dont le 
numérique, la transition énergétique, la sécurité et la protection de nos frontières extérieures. 
Comme tous les pays bénéficieraient de ce budget, ce serait exactement l’opposé d’une 
union de transfert. En résumé, je viens d’évoquer les accélérateurs de l’Union économique, 
sous les aspects micro, macro et budgétaire [slide]. 
3/ Cela m’amène au troisième et dernier cliché : nous devons cesser d’opposer réduction 
du risque et partage du risque ou, pour le formuler autrement, responsabilité et solidarité 
ou encore règles et discrétion. Ces valeurs créent un clivage stérile entre l’Europe du Nord et 
l’Europe du Sud. Pour bien fonctionner, notre Union a besoin des deux : les mécanismes de 
réduction du risque et le partage du risque. Comme je viens de le dire, la prévention crédible 
des crises nécessite de mettre en œuvre une discipline budgétaire (notamment les règles 
actuelles du Pacte de Stabilité et de Croissance), mais aussi de disposer des instruments 
nécessaires pour amortir les effets de chocs asymétriques susceptibles d’apparaître 
brutalement, en dépit de tous les efforts accomplis par un État membre. Il est temps d’oublier 
la guerre de tranchée idéologique. Permettez-moi de partager avec vous quatre domaines 
où des progrès concrets sont nécessaires : 
- premièrement, le renforcement du partage du risque privé. Un moyen simple et évident 
d’y parvenir consiste à mettre en place l’Union des marchés de capitaux au sein de 
l’Union de financement mentionnée précédemment. Nous sommes encore très en retard 
sur les États-Unis où les marchés de capitaux sont capables d’amortir environ 40 % d’un 
Page 4 de 5 
 
choc spécifique à un État. De plus, une véritable Union de financement augmenterait 
encore l’efficacité de la politique monétaire en assurant une meilleure circulation de la 
liquidité dans la zone euro.  
- deuxièmement, le système européen de garantie des dépôts (EDIS). Nous avons 
réalisé deux avancées significatives avec les deux premiers piliers de l’Union bancaire, le 
Mécanisme de surveillance unique (MSU) et le Mécanisme de résolution unique (MRU). 
Nous devons encore, et cela doit être notre priorité, renforcer le MRU en mettant en 
place un filet de sécurité souverain pour le Fonds de résolution unique et un processus 
de prise de décision simplifié pour les cas urgents de résolution. Il est maintenant 
nécessaire d’aboutir à une certaine forme de compromis pour avancer sur le troisième 
pilier, le système européen de garantie des dépôts. Une approche appropriée et 
pragmatique pourrait consister en une première phase centrée sur les besoins de 
liquidité des systèmes nationaux de garantie des dépôts, comme la Commission 
européenne l’a proposé en octobre dernier. Nous n’avons pas besoin dès le début d’une 
garantie européenne intégrée. 
- troisièmement, la restructuration des dettes souveraines. Il est important et légitime 
de nous demander comment rendre la zone euro capable de de mieux résister aux crises 
des dettes souveraines, au cas où elles surviendraient. À cet égard, le renforcement de 
la discipline de marché peut être une partie de la solution, et les propositions émises en 
vue d’établir un mécanisme de restructuration de la dette souveraine se fondent sur cette 
idée. Cependant, nous devons être très prudents et nous assurer que cela ne devienne 
pas une partie du problème. Lorsque les règles sont rigides, les anticipations des 
marchés peuvent déclencher des réactions en chaîne brutales ou des attaques 
spéculatives et mettre la stabilité financière en danger. Et personne ne doit sous-estimer 
le « problème de la transition » sur les dettes existantes si une telle politique devait être 
annoncée. 
- quatrièmement, l’architecture institutionnelle de la zone euro. Si nous progressons 
sur le fond (sur les trois instruments que j’ai mentionnés), il faudrait un ministre des 
Finances de la zone euro pour les mettre en œuvre. Il serait président de l’Eurogroupe et 
membre de la Commission européenne, conformément aux propositions de la 
Commission européenne publiées en décembre 2017. À titre de compromis entre les 
règles et l’aspect discrétionnaire, ce ministre des Finances pourrait s’appuyer sur 
l’expertise d’une institution indépendante, comme un Comité budgétaire européen 
renforcé.

Pour résumer, il est grand temps de prendre des mesures pragmatiques et décisives, au-
delà des trois vieux clichés qui freinent les avancées vers une Union monétaire européenne 
plus pérenne. Ces clichés établissent une distinction stérile entre vision et pragmatisme, 
entre action au niveau européen et réformes nationales, et entre réduction du risque et 
partage du risque. Il existe trois solutions : premièrement, une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation » ; deuxièmement, une meilleure coordination des politiques 
économiques complétée par un instrument axé sur la stabilité au sein du MES (ou du FME) ; 
et troisièmement, un budget d’investissement de la zone euro pour le financement des biens 
communs. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Pouvait-on trouver un endroit plus adapté qu’Amsterdam pour accueillir une conférence sur 
le changement climatique ? Alors que le niveau des mers augmente, les deux-tiers du 
territoire des Pays-Bas risquent d’être inondés
i
. Ce n’est pas un hasard si les 
mathématiciens de ce pays, comme le Pr. Laurens de Haan, ont apporté des contributions 
décisives pour déterminer la hauteur de sécurité des digues littorales en se basant sur la 
théorie des valeurs extrêmes
ii
. L’intérêt des banquiers centraux et des superviseurs à l’égard 
du changement climatique peut sembler plus surprenant. C’est peut-être inattendu, mais ce 
n’est pas une mode, c’est une conviction : la stabilité climatique est, à long terme, l’un des 
déterminants de la stabilité financière. Cet aspect est encore plus important pour nous en 
Europe, car les Traités confient à l’Eurosystème la mission d’« apporter son soutien aux 
politiques économiques générales dans l’Union » 
iii
 ; cela comprend « le développement 
durable de l’Europe fondé sur [...] un niveau élevé de protection et d’amélioration de la 
qualité de l’environnement » 
iv
 (Art. 3). 
Une chose est certaine : le temps nous est compté. Au sommet international sur le climat 
(One Planet Summit) qui s’est tenu à Paris en décembre dernier, le Président Macron a 
adressé un avertissement sérieux, en affirmant que « nous sommes en train de perdre la 
bataille » du changement climatique. Mark Carney nous dira plus tard si nous avons 
échappé à la fameuse « tragédie de l’horizon »
v
, qu’il avait décrite. Si les émissions de 
carbone conservent leur tendance actuelle, et si nous voulons maintenir l’augmentation de la 
température en deçà de 2 °C, notre budget carbone 
vi
 mondial sera consommé d’ici quinze à 
trente ans
vii
.  
En tant que banquiers centraux et superviseurs, notre mission est à la fois humble et 
considérable. Humble parce que la réussite de l’Accord de Paris est de la responsabilité des 
États signataires : l’UE s’est engagée à réduire les émissions de carbone de 40 % au moins 
d’ici à 2030
viii
, et la réglementation financière ne peut se substituer à un programme 
ambitieux sur le climat. Considérable parce que nous devons faire tout notre possible pour 
soutenir et compléter l’action des États. Il s’agit là, pour nous, en tant que superviseurs du 
XXI
e
 siècle, d’un défi majeur. Je dirais même que c’est notre « nouvelle frontière », à 
l’instar du financement de la croissance et des grandes infrastructures au XIX
e
 siècle ou de 
la gestion des grandes crises financières au cours des cent dernières années. 
Pour cette raison, je suis très heureux de constater que le Réseau des banques centrales et 
des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système financier (NGFS), lancé par la Banque de 
France en décembre dernier, prend de l’ampleur. Cette initiative pionnière rassemble, à 
l’heure actuelle, neuf banques centrales et superviseurs de différents pays du monde et elle 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
 
est présidée par Frank Elderson (De Nederlandsche Bank). Nous prévoyons de publier notre 
premier rapport en avril 2019. En attendant, nous devons certes examiner de plus près les 
risques associés au changement climatique, mais nous ne devons pas ignorer les 
opportunités. Dans mes remarques d’aujourd’hui, j’aborderai les deux questions suivantes : 
(i) comment pouvons-nous mieux mesurer les risques de long terme associés au 
changement climatique ? (ii) et comment pouvons-nous développer les opportunités liées au 
financement de la transition ?  
** 
I. Des risques physiques aux risques de transition, et de la photographie à la 
vidéo 
Le Dr. Shuckburg vient de faire une excellente présentation des recherches disponibles, qui 
confirment que les forces du changement climatique sont puissantes et inévitables. Les 
risques physiques – la hausse de la fréquence et de la gravité des phénomènes 
météorologiques extrêmes – constituent évidemment la source de risque la plus visible et la 
plus immédiate pour le secteur financier. Avec 710 catastrophes naturelles en 2017
ix
, nous 
venons de vivre une nouvelle année record pour les turbulences climatiques. La barre des 
600 catastrophes naturelles n’a été franchie que cinq fois, mais ces cinq fois ont eu lieu au 
cours des six dernières années Inutile de préciser que le secteur des assurances est en 
première ligne face aux risques physiques. Toutefois, contrairement à une opinion 
largement répandue, les risques physiques pourraient également largement concerner 
les banques, dans le cas où ils ne seraient pas couverts par les assurances. L’absence 
de couverture assurantielle en cas de catastrophe naturelle (protection gaps) peut 
augmenter le risque de crédit pour les banques si elle entraîne une baisse de l’activité 
économique et une hausse du chômage. Au niveau mondial, ces protection gaps sont déjà 
considérables
x
. Ils pourraient encore se creuser, y compris dans les pays développés, si les 
assureurs augmentaient leurs primes ou se retiraient purement et simplement des 
compartiments de marchés à risque. Les risques physiques doivent donc, à tout le moins, 
être étroitement surveillés.  
Mais ce n’est pas nécessairement aux plus grandes craintes que nous devons accorder le 
plus d’attention. Les risques de transition, ceux qui sont liés à l’ajustement vers une 
économie à faible émission de carbone, sont des risques de long terme moins visibles  et qui 
ne se sont pas encore concrétisés. Les coûts de transition et les incertitudes quant aux 
gagnants et perdants créeront certainement une forte volatilité sur les marchés et 
entraîneront des résultats macroéconomiques agrégés défavorables. Selon nos premières 
estimations faites par l’ACPR – le superviseur français –, 13 % du total net des expositions 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
 
de crédit des banques françaises concernent des secteurs vulnérables aux risques de 
transition
xi
. La DNB s’est livrée à un exercice comparable et a trouvé quasiment la même 
exposition pour les prêteurs néerlandais
xii
. Les institutions financières pourraient objecter que 
le délai de concrétisation de ces risques se situe bien au-delà de leur horizon 
d’investissement et de la maturité moyenne de leurs bilans. Elles pourraient soutenir qu’il est 
possible d’ajuster progressivement leurs expositions le cas échéant. De mon point de vue, il 
est illusoire de penser que lorsque les risques deviendront perceptibles, toutes les parties 
concernées seront capables de réduire leurs expositions au même moment et en bon ordre.  
J’espère que la dynamique actuellement observée chez les superviseurs à travers le monde 
nous permettra de mieux mesurer et atténuer les risques de long terme associés au 
changement climatique, et donc de faciliter la transition. À cet égard,  en tant que 
superviseurs, nous devons faire collectivement des progrès dans deux domaines 
prioritaires.  
Notre première priorité devrait être l'identification et la publication des expositions aux 
risques existant dans le secteur financier : « la photographie des risques ». Un travail 
considérable a déjà été réalisé dans ce sens : les recommandations du Groupe de travail du 
Conseil de stabilité financière sur la publication d’informations financières relatives au climat 
(TCFD) fournissent une base complète et cohérente pour la publication volontaire 
d'informations sur les risques. En plus de cela, je propose que nous identifions les meilleures 
pratiques européennes et que nous nous engagions progressivement sur la voie d'une 
exigence de transparence obligatoire en Europe, sous réserve que deux conditions soient 
remplies afin de ne pas faire peser une charge excessive sur les établissements financiers : 
cette exigence doit être fondée (i) sur le principe « se conformer ou s'expliquer » (comply or 
explain) et (ii) sur une taxonomie commune avec un niveau d'agrégation suffisamment large. 
La loi française 
xiii
 exige déjà que les gestionnaires d'actifs, les banques et les compagnies 
d'assurance publient des informations sur la façon dont ils prennent en compte le 
changement climatique.  
En outre, nous devrions développer des tests prospectifs de résistance au changement 
climatique (carbon stress tests) pour les assurances et les banques – c'est ce que 
j'appelle la « vidéo des risques ». Il s'agit à l'évidence d'une tâche complexe et difficile, 
mais elle est essentielle. Aujourd'hui, nous sommes capables de réaliser des analyses de 
sensibilité pour déterminer l'ampleur des pertes que pourraient subir les portefeuilles des 
établissements financiers dans un certain nombre de scénarios économiques. Mais l'un de 
nos devoirs dans le cadre du Réseau pour le verdissement du système financier sera de 
mener des travaux complémentaires sur deux questions fondamentales : (i) comment 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
 
traduire les scénarios de changement climatique en scénarios économiques à même d'être 
utilisés dans le cadre de nos tests de résistance et (ii) évaluer l’impact des chocs sur la 
probabilité de défaut sur un horizon bien supérieur à celui habituel d’un an.  
 
II. Transformer nos défis quantitatifs et qualitatifs en opportunités sans 
précédent 
Notre objectif est de renforcer le rôle du système financier, non seulement dans la gestion 
des risques mais aussi dans la « mobilisation des capitaux en faveur des investissements 
verts et à faible émission de carbone » 
xiv
. Mais financer la transition vers une économie à 
faible émission de carbone est un défi tout autant quantitatif que qualitatif.   
Le défi quantitatif est lié aux investissements massifs requis dans trois domaines : 
premièrement, les infrastructures et les solutions techniques, en particulier dans les 
transports, la production et la consommation d'énergie et l'agriculture ; deuxièmement, les 
biens immatériels, y compris la formation continue et la recherche ; et troisièmement, 
l'adaptation et l'amélioration de l’existant, notamment la réhabilitation thermique des 
bâtiments. Les besoins sont si importants que le financement public à lui seul ne suffira pas : 
à titre d'exemple, selon les estimations, les besoins mondiaux pourraient atteindre 
90 000 milliards de dollars sur les quinze prochaines années uniquement pour les nouvelles 
infrastructures vertes
xv
.  
Fort heureusement, le secteur privé montre déjà un intérêt croissant pour la finance verte. 
Je pourrais citer beaucoup d'exemples, y compris la forte hausse du marché mondial des 
obligations vertes, + 78 % en 2017 
xvi
, ou le succès de la première émission d'obligations 
souveraines vertes françaises en janvier 2017, avec une allocation de 7 milliards d'euros et 
une demande totale de plus de 23 milliards d'euros qui a été complétée hier. Tout cela 
semble prometteur... mais ce n’est pas encore suffisant. La souscription systématiquement 
excédentaire d'obligations vertes à l’émission témoigne en réalité de l’insuffisance de 
produits financiers verts. Les marchés verts restent des marchés de niche : les obligations 
vertes ne représentent encore que moins de 2 % des émissions de titres de dette 
mondiales
xvii
. Le succès de la transition dépendra également de notre capacité à élargir les 
sources de financement : nous ne devons pas nous contenter des obligations vertes. Il nous 
faut plus de prêts verts, et plus de financements verts en général, accessibles aux 
particuliers, aux PME et aux start-ups.  
Le financement vert nécessite un cadre propice à l'innovation : la titrisation verte, les 
obligations sécurisées vertes, les dérivés verts, les plates-formes de financement participatif 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
 
vertes et la gestion d'actifs verte devraient tous être encouragés. De plus, nous devons 
soigneusement évaluer l'incidence des réglementations existantes. Face à la forte 
pression du secteur financier dans ce domaine, nous ne devons toutefois pas perdre de vue 
notre objectif principal en tant que superviseurs, à savoir la stabilité financière. Jusqu'à 
présent, aucun élément empirique ou théorique n'atteste que les actifs « verts » sont moins 
risqués que les autres, ni qu'ils pourraient justifier une pondération des risques moins élevée 
sous la forme d'un « facteur de soutien vert » (green supporting factor). Nous devrions plutôt 
cibler les actifs « marron » par la mise en place d’un « facteur de pénalisation marron », car 
les risques liés à la transition finiront par se matérialiser un jour. Cela pourrait être conçu 
comme un coussin pour le risque systémique (systemic risk buffer) spécifique, ou être 
intégré dans les exigences au titre du pilier 2. Cette deuxième solution présenterait 
l'avantage d’inciter les banques à améliorer leur capacité à gérer les risques liés au 
changement climatique.  
Ceci m'amène à la question du défi qualitatif. Le risque d'écoblanchiment (greenwashing) 
peut discréditer les marchés verts et entraver leurs progrès. Selon moi, une taxonomie 
claire et harmonisée des actifs et des secteurs verts constitue la condition préalable à un 
développement ordonné des marchés. À cet égard, je salue le plan d'action de la 
Commission européenne, qui fournit l'un des projets les plus ambitieux jamais publiés en 
termes de finance durable. Mais nous devons aller plus loin, au moins au plan européen, y 
compris avec le Royaume-Uni : nous devons travailler à des normes communes sur le 
marché obligataire vert. À l'heure actuelle, deux normes en particulier sont plus répandues : 
les Green Bond principles (GBP) et la Climate Bond Initiative (CBI). Il serait logique de 
promouvoir une convergence vers une norme européenne harmonisée s'appuyant sur 
l'approche GBP en termes de processus et de transparence, et sur l'approche CBI s'agissant 
de la taxonomie. Et il devrait également exister systématiquement une mesure indépendante 
des impacts.  
Enfin, et surtout, nous devons insuffler de la durabilité à nos propres activités, car notre 
crédibilité dépend également de notre exemplarité. À la Banque de France, nous avons 
franchi le mois dernier une étape décisive avec l'adoption d'une Charte d'investissement 
responsable. Nous sommes parmi les premières banques centrales à nous engager à 
améliorer la contribution de nos fonds propres et portefeuilles de retraite à la transition 
environnementale et avons l'intention de rendre compte de nos progrès chaque année.  
** 
Je voudrais conclure par une citation d'un des plus grands écrivains européens du XIX
e
 
siècle, Victor Hugo, qui a écrit : « C'est une triste chose de penser que la nature parle et que 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
 
le genre humain n'écoute pas. » Aujourd'hui, suffisamment d'éléments s'imposent à nous qui 
prouvent que le changement climatique parle de lui-même. Il est grand temps d'écouter et 
d'agir en conséquence. C'est pour cela que nous avons fortement à cœur de prendre nos 
responsabilités. Ce n'est pas encore le cas de tous les pays, malheureusement. Mais c'est 
notre cas, aujourd'hui, et nous formons déjà ensemble une puissante coalition des volontés. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Je suis heureux d’accueillir cette rencontre traditionnelle, Paris Europlace à New York, selon 
un calendrier moins traditionnel : un an après les élections françaises. Et beaucoup de 
choses se sont passées au cours des douze mois écoulés. Dans mes remarques 
aujourd’hui, j’aimerais développer le thème que j’appelle « la dynamique française » et  
de façon plus générale « la dynamique de la zone euro ». Nous disposons d’une opportunité 
unique de mettre en œuvre des réformes essentielles à la fois en France et en Europe et  
il faut absolument que nous la saisissions. J’aimerais donc partager avec vous quelques 
réflexions a) sur notre environnement conjoncturel favorable ; b) de là, sur notre accélération 
structurelle, et c) sur l’attractivité de Paris, notamment dans le monde post-Brexit que nous 
devons préparer. 
*** 
1. Notre opportunité conjoncturelle et la présente phase d’expansion 
[Slide 2] L’économie de la zone euro connaît actuellement une expansion robuste  
et généralisée avec 19 trimestres consécutifs de croissance positive. En 2017, la croissance 
du PIB en volume a atteint un pic de 2,5 % et les indicateurs économiques à court terme 
vont tous dans le sens d’une poursuite de la reprise économique. Selon les dernières 
projections de la BCE, le PIB en volume devrait croître de 2,4 % en 2018, au-dessus de son 
potentiel. Le caractère généralisé de cette croissance économique régulière est 
remarquable : la dispersion entre les pays et les secteurs se situe à son niveau le plus faible 
depuis deux décennies.  
La croissance a été soutenue par la vigueur de la demande domestique et par le 
redressement des exportations nettes. Les conditions de financement des entreprises ont 
été très favorables, ce qui a favorisé l’investissement, tandis que la consommation privée  
a bénéficié des faibles niveaux de l’inflation. 
[Slide 3] Cette croissance économique régulière s’est traduite sur le marché du travail,  
près de 8 millions de travailleurs [7,8 millions] ayant retrouvé un emploi depuis 2013,  
ce qui a largement compensé les destructions d’emplois subies lors de la crise.  
La croissance annuelle de l’emploi a atteint son niveau le plus élevé depuis 2008 et le taux 
de chômage est tombé à 8,7 % au quatrième trimestre 2017, son niveau le plus faible depuis 
neuf ans. À l’avenir, le chômage devrait continuer de baisser pour revenir à 7,2 % en 2020, 
malgré l’augmentation du taux d’activité. 
[Slide 4] En France, la croissance du PIB est robuste, ressortant à 2,0 % en moyenne 
en 2017. L’expansion devrait se poursuivre à un rythme soutenu en 2018, tirée par la vigueur 
de la demande domestique et par une hausse notable des exportations. L’investissement 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
 
devrait rester robuste grâce aux bonnes perspectives d’activité et à des conditions  
de financement favorables. Les exportations nettes devraient se redresser en 2018  
et favoriser la croissance. La reprise devrait se poursuivre en 2019-2020, avec un taux  
de croissance du PIB qui devrait rester supérieur à la croissance potentielle, en dépit d’un 
léger fléchissement de la demande mondiale. 
[Slide 5] En France également, la reprise en cours a entraîné une forte baisse du taux de 
chômage, qui est revenu à 8,9 % au quatrième trimestre 2017. Depuis 2015, la création 
d’emplois a été dopée par les mesures prises pour réduire les coûts de main-d’œuvre (CICE, 
PRS, prime à l’embauche pour les PME) [Je reviendrai de façon détaillée sur les réformes 
structurelles françaises]. Même si le taux de chômage est encore trop élevé, notamment 
chez les jeunes, nos dernières projections tablent sur un recul régulier de ce taux 
jusqu’en 2020. Les créations nettes d’emplois devraient rester robustes à mesure que 
l’économie s’améliore.  
À la suite de l’amélioration sur le marché du travail, la croissance des salaires devrait 
s’accélérer, soutenant le revenu disponible des ménages et renforçant la dynamique solide 
de la consommation privée.  
[Slide 6] Les risques de déflation ont disparu dans la zone euro. L’inflation totale est 
ressortie à 1,3 % en mars, tandis que l’inflation sous-jacente reste stable à 1,0 %. Nous 
sommes désormais sortis de la zone de risque déflationniste, même si les évolutions de 
l’inflation restent encore modérées. Cependant, la reprise économique actuelle et les 
améliorations sur le marché du travail devraient ouvrir la voie à une hausse des tensions 
inflationnistes, préparant un retour de l’inflation à un taux inférieur à, mais proche de 2 %  
à moyen terme. Notre prévision est de 1,7 % pour 2020. 
[Slide 7] Cette hausse progressive de l’inflation dans la zone euro et l’amélioration des 
perspectives en matière d’inflation sont dues en grande partie à la politique monétaire 
accommodante de la BCE. Nous sommes maintenant de plus en plus confiants sur le fait 
que l’inflation se situera bientôt sur une trajectoire durable d’ajustement vers notre objectif 
d’inflation, justifiant ainsi notre stratégie de normalisation progressive. Et nous ne céderons 
pas aux préoccupations budgétaires (fiscal dominance) : nul ne doit s’attendre à ce que nous 
retardions une indispensable normalisation monétaire dans le but de permettre à un État 
membre de régler ses problèmes de dette.  
 
 
 
 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
 
2. Notre accélération structurelle : la France est en phase de rattrapage. 
[Slide 8] La politique monétaire joue pleinement son rôle, mais elle ne peut pas tout faire, 
car son incidence sur les ajustements économiques nationaux au sein de la zone euro est 
limitée. Depuis la crise financière, plusieurs pays européens, notamment l’Espagne,  
ont lancé avec succès d’importantes réformes et ont atteint une croissance durable et plus 
élevée, tout en préservant leur modèle social.  
[Slide 9] Il est cependant nécessaire de poursuivre les efforts afin de stimuler la croissance 
économique à moyen terme. Le chômage structurel demeure élevé et la croissance 
potentielle reste sensiblement inférieure à sa moyenne des années 1990 ou 2000.  
Des réformes structurelles s’imposent pour libérer tout le potentiel économique des pays 
européens. 
À cet égard, le cas de la France est actuellement particulièrement intéressant. Notre pays 
est confronté à d’importantes difficultés structurelles mais, comme je l’ai déjà dit, 
l’environnement économique n’a jamais été aussi favorable aux réformes depuis la crise 
financière. C’est donc maintenant, absolument, que nous devons « réparer le toit ».  
Et la bonne nouvelle, c’est que les réformes sont fermement lancées. Je souligne ce point en 
tant que banquier central totalement indépendant : le nouveau gouvernement s’est en effet 
fortement engagé en faveur des réformes et a déjà mis en œuvre d’importantes réformes 
structurelles afin de stimuler l’emploi, la productivité et la résilience.  
[Slide 10] Les récentes réformes du marché du travail ont élargi l’espace de négociation 
dont disposent les partenaires sociaux en matière de prise de décisions et ont réduit les 
incertitudes liées aux conflits du travail. Cela devrait donner une plus grande flexibilité aux 
entreprises et contribuer à soutenir l’emploi. La réforme en cours de l’apprentissage a pour 
but de rendre cette voie plus attrayante, pour les salariés comme pour les entreprises, afin 
de lutter contre le chômage des jeunes. Dans un contexte marqué par un nombre encore 
trop élevé de postes vacants, la réforme en cours de la formation professionnelle tout au 
long de la vie, dispositif actuellement trop onéreux et inefficace, devrait favoriser une 
meilleure adéquation entre qualifications des travailleurs et besoins des entreprises.  
Si l’on ajoute à cela des réformes très importantes de l’enseignement primaire et secondaire 
et de l’université, on peut espérer une amélioration constante des compétences de la main-
d’œuvre française dans les prochaines années. 
La réforme de l’indemnisation du chômage sera également une contribution essentielle à 
l’amélioration du fonctionnement du marché du travail. Le contrôle plus étroit de l’effort de 
recherche d’emploi devrait accroître le taux d’activité et contribuer également à réduire le 
chômage structurel, tout en améliorant l’efficacité de l’État providence.  
Page 4 sur 6 
 
 
[Slide 11] Enfin, des réformes fiscales cohérentes ont visé à rééquilibrer la charge fiscale 
des facteurs de production vers une imposition à assiette large. Les coûts de main-d’œuvre 
ont été réduits, en particulier grâce au crédit d’impôt sur la masse salariale mis en œuvre 
en 2013 et renforcé par des réductions de cotisations sociales cette année. S’agissant du 
capital, d’importantes mesures ont également été prises afin d’alléger la taxation du capital 
productif et de l’épargne : suppression de l’impôt sur la fortune hors biens immobiliers, 
introduction d’un taux d’imposition unique de 30 % sur les revenus du patrimoine (dividendes 
ou intérêts) des ménages et réduction de l’impôt sur les sociétés de 33 % à 25 % en 2022 
pour assurer la convergence vers la moyenne de l’UE. Ces mesures devraient contribuer à 
soutenir la tendance positive de l’investissement privé national et étranger en France. 
[Slide 12] Toutes ces réformes devraient être renforcées par de nouveaux progrès en 
matière de soutenabilité des finances publiques ; j’espère également une accélération à cet 
égard. Néanmoins, le programme actuel est déjà impressionnant, et il renforce l’attractivité 
de la France. Comme vous le savez, la France possède de nombreux atouts : elle compte de 
nombreuses entreprises technologiques à croissance rapide. Elle offre des infrastructures de 
grande qualité et une qualité de vie élevée. Plus important encore, sa capitale, Paris, en plus 
d’être l’une des villes les plus attrayantes d’Europe, est en bonne position pour devenir le 
principal centre des activités de marché dans la zone euro, en particulier dans le contexte du 
Brexit. 
 
3. L’attrait de Paris en tant que centre financier intégré dans un monde post-Brexit 
Le Brexit a été et reste une mauvaise nouvelle, surtout pour le Royaume-Uni mais 
également pour l’Europe. Pour l’instant, un principe nous semble être la clé de voûte  
de l’accord futur entre l’Union européenne et le Royaume-Uni : préserver l’intégrité de notre 
bien commun, le Marché unique européen. En pratique, cela signifie qu’il est impossible de 
dissocier l’accès et les règles, et que les entités établies au Royaume-Uni ne pourront 
obtenir de passeport européen et accéder au Marché unique si elles ne se conforment pas 
intégralement aux règles du Marché unique et ne reconnaissent pas l’autorité de la Cour 
européenne de Justice. La City de Londres restera bien évidemment une place financière 
majeure au niveau mondial mais elle ne sera plus en position de jouer le rôle de pôle 
financier européen. Dans ce contexte, la poursuite de l’intégration des marchés de capitaux 
de l’UE est d’autant plus nécessaire. Pour réussir dans cette entreprise, il est nécessaire 
d’adopter une approche intégrée qui réunisse et coordonne le plan d’investissement Juncker, 
l’Union bancaire et l’Union des marchés de capitaux afin de parvenir à une véritable « Union 
de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation ». Cette Union de financement 
s’appuiera sur l’excédent d’épargne annuel de 390 milliards d’euros de la zone euro. 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
 
Une autre conséquence du Brexit est qu’un certain nombre d’activités financières seront 
relocalisées au sein de l’UE à 27. Par conséquent, le paysage de la concurrence entre 
places financières va changer, même si l’on ne s’attend pas à voir apparaître une « City de 
Londres » continentale, mais une structure compétitive plus multipolaire et spécialisée.  
Il en va de notre responsabilité collective de favoriser un écosystème compétitif et équitable 
pour les acteurs internationaux ; avec notre corpus réglementaire unique, cette concurrence 
ne permettra aucun « nivellement par le bas », réglementaire ou prudentiel.  
Dans ce contexte, la place financière de Paris possède de nombreux atouts. Paris abrite l’un 
des marchés de capitaux les plus développés d’Europe continentale, elle est numéro un du 
secteur de la gestion d’actifs, elle dispose d’un marché obligataire de premier plan, du plus 
grand marché de titres négociables à court terme (NEU-CP) et occupe la première place en 
matière de financement du capital-risque d’Europe continentale. En outre, Paris offre un 
gisement intéressant de personnel hautement qualifié dans les services financiers.  
Le gouvernement français et les autorités financières du pays, y compris la Banque de 
France, œuvrent également de concert pour faciliter la diffusion d’innovations financières 
saines et solides et pour favoriser le développement d’une finance durable. Ces 
investissements sont protégés par un système bancaire très résilient, accompagné d’une 
réglementation cohérente. Permettez-moi de vous rappeler que Paris abrite déjà l’Autorité 
européenne des marchés financiers et bientôt l’Autorité bancaire européenne. De plus, la 
Cour d’appel de Paris a été dotée d’une chambre internationale en février dernier, les litiges 
commerciaux internationaux relevant de sa compétence. Cette évolution complètera 
l’organisation du Tribunal de Paris, dont le Tribunal de commerce dispose déjà d’une 
chambre internationale. Enfin, et surtout, je voudrais souligner que les autorités françaises 
font actuellement en sorte que la place financière de Paris et ses intervenants bénéficient 
d’un cadre réglementaire rationalisé et favorable à l’activité, notamment dans des domaines 
tels que les émissions obligataires et la titrisation. Dans le même temps, des efforts 
importants ont été réalisés par le gouvernement français afin d’alléger le régime fiscal et les 
cotisations sociales applicables aux « impatriés ». Ce processus, qui avait démarré en 2016 
sous le précédent gouvernement, a été amplifié par le nouveau, notamment à la veille du 
sommet des affaires qui s’est tenu en janvier dernier. 
*** 
La France est en train de changer, pour le meilleur. Mais, elle reste bien évidemment 
tributaire de son environnement économique. Permettez-moi de conclure en formulant deux 
souhaits. Le premier : que l’Europe soit suffisamment courageuse pour profiter de la reprise 
conjoncturelle en cours pour se renforcer. La perspective d’un accroissement des réformes 
en France conjugué à une relance budgétaire plus importante en Allemagne est bienvenue 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
 
mais insuffisante : la zone euro a besoin d’une Union économique plus forte pour éviter de 
surcharger la politique monétaire avant la prochaine récession. Mon second souhait est que 
les États-Unis et le G20 soient suffisamment clairvoyants pour apporter à leurs défis 
économiques des réponses mutilatérales, et non unilatérales : là encore, la France constitue 
un partenaire fiable.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être de nouveau à Londres aujourd’hui et je tiens à vous remercier  
de m’avoir invité à m’exprimer lors de la City Week 2018. Comme on pouvait s’y attendre,  
le Brexit est omniprésent dans le programme de cet évènement. Mais, comme l’avait déclaré 
le Père belge Dominique Pire en recevant le prix Nobel de la Paix en 1958, « les hommes 
construisent trop de murs et pas assez de ponts ». C’est pour cela que je ne vais pas parler 
de ce qui nous divise, mais plutôt de ce qui nous unit. Nous sommes, et nous demeurerons 
toujours, des amis et des partenaires proches, même si nous ne ferons plus partie du même 
club européen. Je vais aujourd’hui évoquer deux défis qui devraient nous unir dans un avenir 
proche : l’impérieuse nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif et la finance de demain dans un 
monde interconnecté. 
** 
1) La nécessité d’un multilatéralisme actif 
La coopération internationale entre pays est plus importante que jamais pour préserver 
l’amélioration actuelle de l’environnement économique mondial : selon les dernières 
prévisions du FMI, la croissance mondiale devrait s’établir à 3,9 % en 2018, après 3,8 % 
en 2017. Et nous devons résister, ensemble, à deux tentations : l’autosatisfaction en matière 
financière et une escalade protectionniste. 
S’agissant du secteur financier, au-delà des frontières de l’Union européenne, et avec 
l’ensemble de nos partenaires, nous devons nous efforcer de maintenir les règles du jeu 
collectives mises en place depuis le sommet du G20 de Londres en 2009. Neuf ans plus 
tard, certains acteurs pourraient être tentés d’avoir la mémoire courte et d’oublier les leçons 
de la crise. Mais affaiblir les réglementations financières ouvrirait la voie à la prochaine crise 
financière. Nous devons donc, à présent, être fermement engagés en faveur d’une « mise en 
œuvre complète, rapide et uniforme » de Bâle III, comme cela a été convenu en décembre 
dernier et indiqué dans le dernier communiqué du G20 de Buenos Aires. Ni les États-Unis 
aujourd’hui, ni le Royaume-Uni demain ne doivent emprunter la voie d’une dérégulation 
unilatérale et nous saluons leur engagement. Une évaluation et des simplifications sont 
évidemment possibles, sous l’égide commune du Conseil de stabilité financière (CSF) : mais 
la concurrence réglementaire équivaudrait à un scénario perdant-perdant aux conséquences 
désastreuses. 
Nous n’en avons toutefois pas encore fini avec la régulation financière. Nous devons encore 
finaliser les initiatives en cours, notamment en ce qui concerne le secteur bancaire parallèle. 
En effet, la priorité réglementaire n’est plus la solvabilité des banques mais la liquidité des 
non-banques : nous avons souligné ces risques pour la stabilité financière lors de nos 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
réunions de Washington la semaine dernière. La Banque de France va publier demain sa 
Revue de la stabilité financière 2018 qui est consacrée au financement de marché, qui est 
en forte croissance. J’insiste sur le fait que nous devons mieux le comprendre, le tester - par 
le biais de tests de résistance (stress tests) sur la liquidité - et le réglementer si nécessaire.  
La stabilité financière est notre bien commun et nous devons également tenir compte d’une 
menace plus subtile qui pèse sur celle-ci : une certaine complaisance au niveau mondial  
vis-à-vis de la dette dans le contexte de politiques monétaires accommodantes qui seront 
moins nécessaires dans un avenir proche. La dette mondiale représentait déjà près de 
200 % du PIB mondial avant la crise (en 2007) mais atteint 220 % aujourd’hui. Pour contrer 
cette complaisance vis-à-vis de la dette, il convient de réagir par  des politiques budgétaires 
saines pour la dette publique, un financement responsable de la part des acteurs financiers 
pour la dette privée et, si nécessaire, des mesures macroprudentielles.  
S’agissant plus généralement du multilatéralisme, nous devons continuer à travailler 
ensemble pour préserver l’ordre économique et commercial mondial. Nous, les Européens, 
main dans la main avec le Canada, le Japon et d’autres pays, devons résolument défendre 
des relations économiques internationales basées sur des règles et des institutions 
multilatérales respectées de tous : nous sommes tous conscients qu’une escalade des 
menaces protectionnistes de la part des États-Unis freinerait la croissance partout dans le 
monde. L’incertitude récente exerce probablement déjà des effets négatifs sur 
l’investissement : vous avez pu l’observer sur l’économie britannique depuis le vote du Brexit 
en 2016. Et des droits de douane effectifs seraient encore plus dommageables : selon la 
plupart des calculs, y compris les nôtres, une hausse de 10 % des tarifs douaniers 
entraînerait une réduction de plus de 10 % du commerce mondial ainsi qu’une baisse du PIB 
mondial de plus de 2 %, à commencer par les États-Unis.  
 
2) La finance de demain 
J’en viens maintenant à mon second point : la finance de demain dans un monde 
interconnecté. Permettez-moi tout d’abord de vous rappeler que la France et le Royaume–
Uni ont déjà développé une approche de la réglementation de l’innovation qui est similaire et, 
je le crois, prometteuse. Nous parlons de « proportionnalité » à Paris ou de « bac à sable » 
(sandbox) à Londres. Quoi qu’il en soit, c’est le moyen de résoudre un paradoxe apparent : 
on prétend souvent que la réglementation est l’ennemie de l’innovation. En réalité,  
la réglementation a un rôle à jouer pour stimuler l’innovation tout en la rendant sûre. Pour 
citer un exemple, en permettant à des tiers d’accéder en toute sécurité à des données 
relatives aux paiements, la version révisée de la directive européenne sur les services  
Page 3 sur 5 
 
de paiement (DSP2) constitue un facteur d’innovation notable. De manière plus générale, en 
France, depuis sa création en 2016, le pôle ACPR FinTech Innovation a permis d’orienter 
environ 300 Fintechs.   
Il existe tant d’innovations prometteuses qui vont accroître la satisfaction des 
consommateurs, renforcer la concurrence et réduire les coûts. Et, à l’évidence, chacune 
d’entre elles – du big data aux services de paiement – nécessite un suivi et une réponse 
spécifiques de la part des régulateurs, suivant une approche ouverte et évolutive.  
Une solution applicable à tous (one size fits all) comme la certitude que la solution élaborée 
une fois est valable pour toujours (one time seizes all) seraient deux mauvaises réponses à 
l’innovation financière. Permettez-moi, néanmoins, de vous faire part de quelques réflexions 
sur quatre défis et opportunités qui nous sont communs : les cyber-risques, les crypto-actifs, 
l’intelligence artificielle et le changement climatique. 
 Les cyber-risques représentent une menace majeure, et donc investir dans la 
cyber-sécurité constitue le premier accélérateur de l’innovation. Il est clair que le niveau 
actuel de coordination des cyber–attaques ne peut être réduit que par une réponse tout 
aussi coordonnée. Nous devons donner davantage de pouvoirs au groupe d’experts sur la 
cyber–sécurité du G7 et renforcer les « principes de Bari » adoptés en mai dernier.  
C’est pourquoi je salue la création d’un groupe du G7 consacré à des cyber–exercices 
transfrontières. Et je confirme aujourd’hui que la Banque de France coordonnera le test 
du G7 en 2019. La cyber-sécurité sera effectivement l’une des priorités de la présidence 
française du G7 l’année prochaine.   
Outre les cyber–risques, nous devons traiter sérieusement la question de l’émergence des 
crypto–actifs. La technologie sur laquelle ils s’appuient est clairement porteuse d’innovation 
durable. La Banque de France est la première banque centrale à offrir au marché un service 
fondé sur la blockchain, et nous souhaitons continuer à expérimenter cette technologie. Pour 
autant, le soutien apporté à la technologie blockchain n’est pas synonyme de soutien 
aveugle au bitcoin et aux actifs spéculatifs similaires. Le mois dernier, lors du G20, nous 
avons été clairs sur ce point et je le serai également aujourd’hui. Premièrement, l’utilisation 
fréquente de la terminologie « monnaie digitale ou virtuelle » est source de confusion pour le 
grand public quant à la véritable nature de ces actifs : ce ne sont pas des monnaies, ils n’en 
ont aucune des fonctions principales – réserve de valeur, moyen d’échange, unité de 
compte. En outre, les crypto–actifs sont porteurs de risques évidents en matière de 
protection des consommateurs et des investisseurs, ainsi que de blanchiment des capitaux 
et de financement du terrorisme. Par conséquent, ils nécessitent des réponses harmonisées 
au niveau international : le Conseil de stabilité financière, en concertation avec d’autres 
organismes en charge de la définition des normes et le Groupe d’action financière 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
internationale (GAFI), devraient faire des recommandations d’ici juillet prochain.  
En particulier, nous devons travailler sur les plateformes de conversion et sur celles qui 
fournissent des services faisant le lien entre crypto–actifs et économie réelle.  
D’un point de vue plus prospectif, l’intelligence artificielle (IA) figurera parmi les 
technologies ayant le plus d’impact sur le secteur de la finance au cours des années  
à venir
i
 : jusqu’à 30 % des projets des grandes banques françaises actuellement en cours de 
développement portent majoritairement sur l’IA et pour les assureurs le potentiel est tout 
aussi important qu’il s’agisse des assurances dommages traditionnelles ou des produits 
d’assurance-vie. Les bénéfices attendus de l’IA en matière de relation clientèle et de gestion 
des risques sont nombreux : nous n’en connaissons pas les limites et nous ne devons pas 
avoir peur de l’IA. Pour en permettre une utilisation plus large en toute sécurité, nous avons 
créé un groupe de travail sur l’IA, animé par l’ACPR et rassemblant tous les représentants 
concernés de l’industrie. Et je souligne déjà que nous devons mettre en œuvre 
collectivement au moins trois principes fondamentaux : (a) promouvoir une meilleur 
compréhension des algorithmes pour éviter l’« effet boîte noire » ; (b) garantir une 
gouvernance sûre des systèmes fondés sur l’IA ; (c) promouvoir une utilisation éthique des 
données afin que des applications fondées sur de l’IA et non biaisées soient propices à 
l’inclusion. 
Enfin, et surtout, la finance verte représente une nouvelle frontière pour le XXI
e
 siècle pour 
nous, banquiers centraux et superviseurs. Une de nos priorités est de mieux mesurer  
les risques à long terme associés au changement climatique : nous avons besoin à la fois 
d’une « photographie des risques », à savoir l’identification et la publication des expositions, 
et une « vidéo des risques » fournie par des tests de résistance prospectifs sur le risque 
carbone  (carbon stress tests). Mais nous souhaitons également développer les immenses 
opportunités associées au financement de la transition vers une économie à faible émission 
de carbone – il s’agit de trouver près de 90 trillions de dollars d’ici 2030 –, tout en prévenant 
le risque d’écoblanchiment (green washing). Il serait logique de promouvoir une convergence 
vers une norme européenne harmonisée pour les obligations vertes – incluant le Royaume-
Uni –, s’appuyant sur l’approche Green Bond Principles en termes de processus et de 
transparence, et sur l’approche Climate Bond Initiative s’agissant de la taxonomie. Il reste 
beaucoup à faire au cours des prochaines années. À cet égard, je me réjouis de compter  
la Banque d’Angleterre parmi les membres fondateurs du Réseau des banques centrales et 
des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système financier (Central Banks and Supervisors 
Network for Greening the Financial System - NGFS), qui a été lancé par la Banque de 
France en décembre dernier. Il s’agit là d’une « coalition de volontés » enthousiaste et en 
développement rapide : les neufs membres fondateurs devraient être rejoints rapidement par 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
trois nouveaux membres et deux observateurs : la BRI et l’OCDE. D’autres banques 
centrales et superviseurs importants sont sur le point d’adhérer.

À propos d’Internet, Stephen Hawking a prononcé cette célèbre formule : « Nous sommes 
désormais tous connectés […] tels les neurones d’un cerveau géant ». Cette formule pourrait 
s’appliquer aussi à la finance de demain dans un monde interconnecté. Chacun d’entre 
nous – régulateur ou professionnel – est au moins un neurone ; nous devons être connectés 
aux autres neurones pour produire des idées innovantes. De même, aucun pays ou 
institution financière ne peut, à lui seul, apporter une réponse adaptée aux défis de ce 
monde en perpétuelle évolution : nous devons absolument conjuguer nos efforts pour 
construire notre avenir. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames, Messieurs, 
J’ai le plaisir de vous accueillir pour la présentation du rapport d’activité 2017 de l’Autorité de 
contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR), [slide 2] avec Bernard Delas, vice-président de 
l’ACPR, Rémi Bouchez, président de la commission des sanctions, et Edouard Fernandez-
Bollo, secrétaire général de l’ACPR. [Slide 3] 
En 2017, l’ACPR a une fois de plus beaucoup œuvré pour une finance plus sûre. Je tiens à 
remercier les plus de mille femmes et hommes de l’ACPR – 1 026 ETP à fin 2017 – qui ont 
travaillé très activement à cette fin et je veux souligner quelques acquis essentiels de l’année 
écoulée. [Slide 4] 
** 
I. L’ACPR a été fortement impliquée dans la mise en place de normes internationales 
communes, à même de renforcer la stabilité financière 
Au niveau international, l’ACPR a apporté une contribution décisive à la finalisation de 
Bâle III. Je le redis, l’accord du 7 décembre 2017 est le meilleur possible pour la France et 
l’Europe. Le dispositif prudentiel qui en découle réduira la variabilité non justifiée des actifs 
pondérés mais restera sensible aux risques, ce qui était l’une de nos préoccupations 
majeures. Il est totalement compatible avec le bon financement de l’économie française. Je 
me félicite que la Commission européenne ait lancé les travaux pour son application en 
Europe. Dans un premier temps, l’Autorité bancaire européenne rendra un rapport 
d’évaluation. Des données vont être nécessaires sur certains domaines d’activité et j’invite 
tous les établissements à participer activement aux collectes.  
En Europe, l’ACPR a continué à apporter un fort soutien aux travaux du Mécanisme de 
supervision unique et du Mécanisme de résolution unique. L’harmonisation des pratiques 
de contrôle bancaire au sein de la zone euro est l’un des objectifs majeurs de l’ACPR. Du 
côté des assurances, l’ACPR est engagée, notamment au sein de l’EIOPA, dans la 
préparation de la révision de la directive Solvabilité 2, prévue en 2018, et des mesures du 
« paquet branches longues » en 2020. L’ambition sera de mieux concilier exigences 
prudentielles et investissement accru en actions et infrastructures : une révision, ce ne peut 
pas être un statu quo. 
L’actualité européenne a aussi été marquée par les travaux liés au Brexit et à la perte à venir 
du « passeport européen » par le Royaume-Uni. L’ACPR sera particulièrement vigilante à ce 
que les activités transférées en France soient opérées par des entités capables de gérer les 
risques associés. Nous ne pourrons tolérer ni l’existence de « coquilles vides », ni aucun 
manquement aux règles prudentielles qui garantissent notre stabilité financière. 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
En 2018, nous devrons poursuivre nos efforts pour encourager la consolidation du 
secteur financier européen. Celle-ci doit bien sûr avoir son volet institutionnel et, à ce titre, 
il est crucial de parachever l’Union bancaire. L'accord intervenu vendredi dernier sur la 
révision de CRR2 -et notamment le MREL- est une très bonne étape,  mais nous ne sommes 
pas au bout. La priorité à ce titre est le deuxième pilier de résolution, plus encore que le 
troisième pilier de garantie des dépôts. Il faut rapidement un filet de sécurité commun  – 
common backstop – au Fonds de résolution unique, et un schéma commun pour mieux 
assurer la liquidité des entités financièrement saines, post-résolution. Dès lors que nous 
aurons achevé la résolution, le contexte devrait être propice à l’émergence de groupes 
bancaires et d’assurance transfrontières et de produits d’épargne pan-européens. Il nous 
faut pour cela travailler à la suppression des obstacles réglementaires qui entravent 
aujourd’hui les fusions transfrontières.  Dans le cadre d’une « Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation », un secteur financier plus intégré permettra de mieux diriger 
l’épargne abondante – près de 400 Mds € d’excédent en zone euro – vers les 
investissements productifs, les fonds propres et l’innovation dans notre continent.  
Avec la bonne régulation et la bonne supervision microprudentielle, la bonne politique 
macroprudentielle complète désormais le « trépied » de l’après-crise. L’ACPR a contribué 
activement aux réflexions du Haut Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF). Face à la 
croissance rapide et excessive de l’endettement de quelques grandes entreprises, le HCSF 
a adopté un dispositif qui entrera en vigueur le 1
er
 juillet prochain ; il impose aux banques 
systémiques françaises une limite sur leurs expositions vis-à-vis des grandes entreprises 
non financières résidentes les plus endettées. Le HCSF reste néanmoins vigilant face à la 
progression rapide du crédit bancaire au secteur privé, à +5,5 % au premier trimestre 2018. 
La dette privée française atteint désormais 130,2 % du PIB à fin 2017, la plus élevée des 
grands pays de la zone euro. Depuis 2014, elle a augmenté de 9,4 % du PIB, tandis qu’elle 
reculait de  5,4 % du PIB pour la moyenne de la zone euro. Le HCSF l’a indiqué le 29 mars 
dernier : il se tient prêt à agir. En particulier, si nous devions décider le « coussin 
contracyclique » de fonds propres, ce ne serait évidemment pas pour arrêter le crédit 
aujourd’hui : ce serait – comme son nom l’indique – pour éviter son arrêt demain lors d’un 
retournement de cycle. À défaut de fonds propres suffisants, les banques pourraient gérer 
les risques accrus, se matérialisant alors dans leurs bilans, par une restriction des nouveaux 
crédits. C’est ce cycle excessif du crédit – ce risque de « go and stop » connu dans les 
crises financières –, qu’un coussin de fonds propres modéré peut avoir pour finalité de lisser.  
 
 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
II. L’ACPR a été particulièrement active vis-à-vis des risques émergents, ainsi que des 
nouvelles technologies 
En 2017, l’ACPR a accordé une attention toute particulière aux risques et opportunités pour 
le secteur financier liés aux nouvelles technologies, en particulier par le biais de son pôle 
« FinTech Innovation ». Nous veillons à orienter au mieux les nouveaux acteurs – plus de 
300 acteurs ont été rencontrés depuis la création de ce pôle en 2016
i
. Mais il s’agit tout 
autant que les acteurs bien établis s’adaptent à la révolution numérique et soient toujours 
mieux préparés face aux risques liés à la cyber-sécurité. À ce sujet, je salue la création d’un 
groupe du G7 consacré à des cyber–exercices transfrontières. C’est la Banque de France 
qui coordonnera le test du G7 en 2019. La cyber-sécurité sera en effet l’une des priorités de 
la présidence française du G7 l’année prochaine.  
Sur l’adaptation des acteurs existants au numérique, l’ACPR a publié en mars 2018 une 
étude remarquée sur l’adaptation des banques et des assurances à la révolution numérique
ii
. 
C’est – elles en conviennent toutes maintenant – leur défi essentiel, voire existentiel, bien 
au-delà des taux bas ou des règlementations prudentielles. La capacité des établissements 
à conserver leur relation clientèle, de l’agence jusqu’au smartphone, est particulièrement 
mise à l’épreuve. La réponse est d’abord celle des établissements, de leur stratégie, leur 
offre clients, leur gouvernance, leurs investissements. Mais la régulation aussi doit 
s’adapter : « même activité, même régulation » bien sûr, et les Big techs devront appliquer 
les règles des banques et des assurances si elles se lancent dans les mêmes activités 
financières régulées. Le défi va cependant au-delà de la seule règlementation financière ; 
c’est la bonne et équitable application à tous de trois régulations plus larges : la protection 
des données, la surveillance de la concurrence et des concentrations, et la cyber-sécurité. 
C’est un défi qui ne se traitera que par la coopération internationale, nous en sommes 
conscients. Face à la révolution numérique, personne ne doit s’attendre pour autant à ce que  
régulation – nécessaire – signifie protection des situations existantes. La seule réponse 
efficace, c’est évidemment l’innovation.  
Nous devons aussi être capables de nous projeter sur le long terme et c’est pourquoi l’ACPR 
a activement œuvré  pour une surveillance accrue du risque climatique. Elle a en particulier 
participé à la création d’un réseau international des banques centrales et des 
superviseurs pour le « verdissement » du système financier, dans le prolongement du 
One Planet Summit qui s’est tenu à Paris. C’est déjà un succès. Les neuf membres 
fondateurs ont été rejoints rapidement par quatre nouveaux membres, dont la Banque 
centrale européenne, et deux observateurs : la BRI et l’OCDE. D’autres banques centrales et 
superviseurs importants sont sur le point d’adhérer. 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
III. Des exigences durables : la protection de la clientèle et la lutte contre le 
financement du terrorisme et le blanchiment d’argent  
La lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme (LCB-FT) reste un objectif 
primordial. Les équipes de l’ACPR ont poursuivi leur action,  visant notamment à s’assurer 
que l’ensemble des activités exercées par les banques françaises via leurs implantations à 
l’étranger soient soumises à un pilotage actif par les maisons-mères. Je rappelle ici 
l’évidence : le dispositif LCB-FT d’un groupe bancaire doit être déployé avec la même 
rigueur dans ses implantations à l’étranger qu’au sein de ses entités françaises. 
S’agissant de l’inclusion bancaire et du contrôle des pratiques commerciales, la 
Banque de France mène une action constante pour favoriser l’accès de populations fragiles 
à des services bancaires adaptés et qu’elle lutte contre l’exclusion de personnes en difficulté, 
y compris du fait de frais bancaire excessifs : il y a encore ici des progrès indispensables. 
Bernard Delas reviendra aussi sur la LPS en assurance construction. 
** 
Pour conclure, je veux partager avec vous quelques chiffres éclairants concernant la solidité 
de notre système financier [slide 5]. En 2017, le produit net bancaire des 6 principaux 
groupes bancaires a atteint 146,4 Mds €. Il s’agit certes d’une faible progression (+0,5 %) par 
rapport à 2016, mais le coût du risque est extrêmement bas, à nouveau en baisse 
significative (-18 %) en 2017, tout comme la part des encours dépréciés qui ne représentent 
plus que 3,45 % du portefeuille de crédit. L’amélioration de la qualité du bilan des banques, 
conjuguée au maintien de la hausse des fonds propres, a encore permis la progression des 
ratios prudentiels. Le ratio de solvabilité CET1 cumulé de ces 6 groupes a atteint 13,8 % fin 
2017, contre 13,3 % fin 2016 et surtout 5,8 % fin 2008. S’agissant des assurances, je note 
aussi avec satisfaction que le taux de couverture du capital de solvabilité des principaux 
groupes a progressé, à 212 % fin 2017.  
En somme, le système financier français est un des plus solides d’Europe et c’est un des 
grands atouts de notre écnomie. J’ai toute confiance en sa capacité à relever les défis à 
venir et à tirer parti des opportunités futures. Je vais maintenant céder la parole à Bernard 
Delas, qui présentera l’actualité prudentielle du secteur de l’assurance. Rémi Bouchez 
exposera ensuite l’activité de la Commission des sanctions. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir pour cette nouvelle conférence de l’Autorité de 
Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) consacrée ce matin aux grands enjeux de la 
révision du règlement prudentiel pour les banques. Le sujet n’est pas nouveau … mais son 
actualité est permanente. Je vais dans un premier temps insister sur la sécurité accrue déjà 
atteinte en matière prudentielle : l’accord du 7 décembre 2017 sur la finalisation de Bâle 3 et 
l’utilisation désormais usuelle d’instruments macroprudentiels. J’évoquerai ensuite ce qui 
reste devant nous en Europe, à savoir l’indispensable achèvement de l’Union bancaire.   
** 
I. Une mise en œuvre de l’accord Bâle 3 du 7 décembre 2017 en Europe, fidèle et 
conforme au calendrier prévu, est indispensable  
La finalisation des accords de Bâle 3 – et non de Bâle 4, définitivement non – clôt une 
décennie d’efforts réglementaires qui ont considérablement renforcé la solidité du système 
bancaire international. Je le redis, l’accord du 7 décembre 2017 est le meilleur accord 
possible pour la France et pour l’Europe. Il est équilibré et raisonnable : la sensibilité au 
risque du dispositif prudentiel a été préservée grâce à un large maintien des approches 
internes, ce qui était l’une de nos préoccupations majeures. De surcroît, la confiance dans 
les modèles internes sera renforcée par un encadrement accru, tandis que l’augmentation 
des exigences de capital restera mesurée et étalée dans le temps jusqu’en 2027. Les 
banques demandaient à juste titre une visibilité stratégique de long terme sur leur cadre 
réglementaire : elles l’ont, désormais.  
L’accord que nous avons négocié repose sur un engagement fort de mise en œuvre par les 
grandes juridictions, y compris les États-Unis. L’Union européenne doit bien sûr être elle 
aussi fidèle à sa parole, dans la mise en œuvre et le calendrier.  
Nous sommes, par ailleurs, confiants quant à l’achèvement rapide des discussions actuelles 
concernant le standard sur les risques de marché. La première version du texte publiée en 
2016 aurait entraîné ex-post une augmentation trop forte et non justifiée des exigences de 
fonds propres sur ces activités. L’ACPR a depuis activement participé aux travaux du groupe 
technique du Comité de Bâle en charge des risques de marché. Les nouvelles règles 
proposées dans le document qui fait actuellement l’objet d’une consultation devraient 
permettre de revenir aux impacts initialement souhaités ex-ante, c’est-à-dire une 
augmentation moyenne de 20 à 30 % de la charge en fonds propres au titre des risques de 
marché.  
À côté de la règlementation – ainsi clarifiée – et de la supervision microprudentielle, les 
politiques macroprudentielles complètent maintenant dans beaucoup de pays le trépied 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
de la stabilité financière. En France, l’ACPR contribue activement aux réflexions du Haut 
Conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF), présidé par le Ministre de l’Économie et des 
Finances. Face à la croissance rapide et excessive de l’endettement de quelques grandes 
entreprises, le HCSF a adopté un dispositif qui entrera en vigueur le 1er juillet prochain ; il 
impose aux banques systémiques françaises une limite sur leurs expositions vis-à-vis des 
grandes entreprises non financières résidentes les plus endettées. Le HCSF reste 
néanmoins vigilant face à la progression rapide du crédit bancaire au secteur privé, à +5,5 % 
au premier trimestre 2018. La dette privée française atteint désormais 130 % du PIB à fin 
2017, la plus élevée des grands pays de la zone euro. Depuis 2014, elle a augmenté de plus 
de 9 % du PIB, tandis qu’elle reculait de  5,4 % du PIB pour la moyenne de la zone euro. Le 
HCSF l’a indiqué le 29 mars dernier : il se tient prêt à agir. En particulier, si nous devions 
décider lors de notre prochaine réunion un « coussin contracyclique » de fonds propres, ce 
ne serait évidemment pas pour arrêter le crédit aujourd’hui : ce serait – comme son nom 
l’indique – pour éviter son arrêt demain lors d’un retournement de cycle, en particulier pour 
les PME. À défaut de fonds propres suffisants, les banques pourraient gérer les risques 
accrus, se matérialisant alors dans leurs bilans, par une restriction des nouveaux crédits. 
C’est ce cycle excessif du crédit – ce risque de « go and stop » connu dans les crises 
financières –, qu’un coussin de fonds propres modéré peut avoir pour finalité de lisser. Il faut 
noter au passage qu’une nette majorité d’États membres de l’Union européenne ont adopté 
d’autres mesures macroprudentielles de limitation spécifique du crédit immobilier, 
contraignant les ménages : il n’en est à mes yeux pas question en France. 
 
II. Pour réduire la fragmentation et contribuer au private risk sharing en Europe, nous 
devons maintenant achever l’Union bancaire. 
Nous devons désormais résolument œuvrer en faveur de l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire 
européenne. Je veux insister d’abord sur le pourquoi. La finalisation de l’Union bancaire 
doit, aux côtés de l’Union des marchés de capitaux, favoriser les conditions d’un meilleur 
partage des risques entre les acteurs privés (private risk sharing) au sein de la zone euro. Le 
partage des risques privés remplit une fonction de stabilisation économique : ainsi, aux 
États-Unis les flux financiers privés entre États fédérés sont un mécanisme d’amortissement 
plus puissant que les mécanismes budgétaires induits par un partage des risques publics. 
Qui plus est, ce partage des risques privés doit permettre de mobiliser l’important excédent 
d’épargne de la zone euro – de 390 milliards d’euros en 2017 – au profit des entreprises 
européennes, au sein d’une véritable Union de Financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation au niveau européen. 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
Nous avons franchi un pas avec l’accord du 25 mai au Conseil Ecofin sur le « paquet 
bancaire » issu de la proposition législative de la Commission du 23 novembre 2016. Même 
s’il convient d’attendre la proposition du Parlement et l’issue du trilogue, cet accord est 
globalement positif. Sur le volet supervision, il permet à l’Union Européenne de disposer de 
l’ensemble des ratios prudentiels du cadre international. En parallèle, l’introduction 
progressive de la nouvelle approche de mesure des risques de marché,– la FRTB – ,encore 
en cours de finalisation à Bâle, est prévue. En outre, il y a une première avancée en faveur 
de la reconnaissance de la zone euro comme juridiction unique, permettant au superviseur 
de considérer les expositions transfrontalières au sein de l’Union bancaire comme des 
expositions domestiques pour la mesure de la systémicité des banques européennes. Sur la 
résolution, nous avons obtenu une extension de l’exigence de subordination du MREL au-
delà des établissements systémiques d’importance mondiale, diminuant ainsi l’effet de seuil 
entre les grandes banques qualifiées de systémiques au niveau mondial (GSIBs) et les 
autres banques. Par ailleurs, le texte définit un plafond d’exigence de dette subordonnée, 
très proche du standard international TLAC.  
Cet accord comporte cependant des éléments plus problématiques sur lesquels nous 
resterons vigilants. Pour n’en citer qu’un, concernant le MREL interne, il aurait été 
souhaitable d’avoir des possibilités d’exemption transfrontalière à l’intérieur de l’Union 
bancaire similaires à la méthodologie de calcul de la surcharge en capital pour les banques 
systémiques. De plus, nous sommes préoccupés par l’introduction dans le calibrage du 
MREL interne d’une référence au seuil permettant l’accès au Fonds de Résolution, ce qui n’a 
pas de sens lorsque la résolution est réalisée au niveau de la maison mère. 
S’agissant de ce qui reste à faire sur l’Union bancaire, l’achèvement de la résolution est, à 
mon sens, la première des priorités, plus encore que le troisième pilier de garantie des 
dépôts. Mario Draghi y a beaucoup insisté dans son discours de Florence du 11 maii. Dans 
la plupart des grandes juridictions – États-Unis, Royaume-Uni, Japon –, les capacités 
d’intervention des fonds de résolution ne sont pas plafonnées car elles sont sécurisées par 
les autorités budgétaires, sans être une charge pour les finances publiques, puisque les 
éventuelles mises de fonds publiques sont d’expérience remboursées par le secteur privé. 
Lors de la dernière crise financière, la confiance du marché et des déposants résultant de 
l’existence d’une ligne de crédit garantie par le Trésor américain a permis à la Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) de conduire 500 cas de résolution sans puiser dans 
les ressources du filet de sécuritéii. Aujourd’hui, en cas de crise sévère dans l’Union bancaire 
européenne, les ressources du Fonds de résolution unique (FRU) pourraient être épuisées.  
C’est pourquoi, il faut rapidement mettre en place un filet de sécurité commun (common 
backtsop) au Fonds de résolution unique. Je veux le dire clairement : l’objectif d’un common 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
backstop n’est pas de procéder à un renflouement externe ni de mobiliser les budgets des 
États. Le dispositif public n’interviendrait qu’en subsidiarité, et l’ensemble des sommes 
versées serait remboursé graduellement par le secteur bancaire. Il s’agit plutôt de renforcer 
la confiance dans la résolution bancaire en Europe en montrant que celle-ci sera toujours en 
mesure d’intervenir efficacement en cas de crise. Un tel système incitera aussi à lever les 
contraintes posées par certaines autorités nationales aux flux de capitaux et de liquidité. Je 
considère comme une priorité absolue la proposition de la Commission européenne de 
mettre en place un filet de sécurité au travers d’une ligne de crédit apportée par le 
Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES). Nous avons, par ailleurs, besoin d’un schéma 
commun de fourniture de liquidité conforme aux règles de la politique monétaire de la zone 
euro et pouvant bénéficier à des banques financièrement assainies après leur résolution.  
Bien sûr, il nous faudra trouver un compromis pour avancer sur le troisième pilier de l’Union 
bancaire, la garantie des dépôts. Dès lors que nous aurons achevé la résolution, nous 
aurons moins besoin d’un schéma européen mutualisé. Une approche pragmatique pourrait 
être d’instaurer un système de prêts entre les schémas de garantie des dépôts (SGD) 
nationaux, assortis de mécanismes de garantie afin d’éviter que les avances de liquidités ne 
se traduisent par des pertes pour les SGD prêteurs. Ceci permettrait de partager  la liquidité 
sans partager les risques, ce qui renforcerait déjà la confiance du secteur financier et la 
protection des déposants.  
** 
Pour conclure, je veux souligner que l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire en Europe est un des 
points essentiels d’une ambition plus large : l’indispensable renforcement de l’Union 
économique. Comme l’a dit Mario Draghi le 11 mai, « les citoyens européens ont appris à 
connaître l'euro et à avoir confiance dans l'euro. Mais ils attendent également que l'euro 
apporte la stabilité et la prospérité promises. Il est donc de notre devoir, en tant que 
dirigeants, et en retour de ce témoignage de confiance, d’agir dans les domaines de notre 
Union qui sont […] inachevés ». Au-delà des débats démocratiques nationaux – il n’en 
manque pas aujourd’hui, ni en Europe ni ailleurs –, cette confiance dans l’euro est notre actif 
partagé, partout. Cette confiance nous oblige, avec l’exigence du respect du réel, mais aussi 
avec l’urgence du calendrier et – je crois – de l’Histoire.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
Bonjour et bienvenue à Paris pour la sixième conférence commune organisée par la 
Deutsche Bundesbank et la Banque de France. Je tiens à remercier les organisateurs 
Emmanuel Fahri, Emanuel Moench et Benoit Mojon d’avoir rassemblé un ensemble de 
contributions aussi intéressantes. Je reviendrai sur le sujet de la conférence un peu plus 
tard. 
Ce matin, je voudrais, dans cette introduction, évoquer une question au centre de l'actualité 
pour la politique monétaire : comment renforcer la confiance et quelle réaction adopter face à 
l'incertitude induite par les politiques économiques ? Nous vivons de toute évidence dans un 
monde de plus en plus incertain. L’imprévisibilité de la politique commerciale américaine – 
ou pire, son orientation protectionniste – et les incertitudes entourant le Brexit risquent 
d'annuler une bonne partie des bénéfices induits par une économie intégrée au niveau 
mondial. La zone euro elle-même voit un retour de l'incertitude. Winston Churchill a 
prononcé cette célèbre formule : « Le véritable génie réside dans la capacité à évaluer des 
informations incertaines, dangereuses et contradictoires » Bien sûr nous, banquiers 
centraux, ne prétendons pas être des génies, mais notre devoir en tant que décideurs est de 
gérer cette incertitude, dans le respect de notre mandat. 
I. Comment renforcer la confiance ? 
Je n'ai pas besoin de répéter aujourd'hui les décisions importantes que nous avons 
annoncées lors de notre récente réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs à Riga. Nous avons 
exprimé notre confiance dans la convergence vers un ajustement durable de la trajectoire de 
l'inflation. Permettez-moi de présenter plus en détail les fondements de cette confiance, en 
examinant tout d'abord les données et les prévisions économiques, puis certains principes 
de notre politique monétaire. 
Données et prévisions 
En économie, il peut être difficile de savoir avec précision où l'on se situe. Les données 
mensuelles et trimestrielles peuvent être assez fluctuantes et de multiples hypothèses se 
révèlent souvent plausibles pour les expliquer : erreurs de mesure ; effets saisonniers 
anormaux ; effets ponctuels, comme les grèves ou les catastrophes naturelles ; ou une 
véritable modification de l'économie sous-jacente. L’évolution de la production au cours du 
premier trimestre en constitue un bon exemple. Le ralentissement de la croissance du PIB 
en volume de 0,7 % au T4 2017 à 0,4 % au T1 2018 était-il lié à une erreur de mesure ? À 
une épidémie de grippe en Allemagne ou à une vague de froid ? Révélait-il l’inquiétude liée à 
un éventuel  conflit commercial ? Ou signalait-il un ralentissement de la croissance 
économique sous-jacente ? Le Conseil des gouverneurs a estimé que ce ralentissement 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
résultait largement d'une modération de la croissance exceptionnellement forte du quatrième 
trimestre, accentuée par des facteurs temporaires et d'offre au plan tant intérieur que 
mondial, ainsi que d'un affaiblissement de la contribution des échanges commerciaux.  
Les projections établies par les services de l'Eurosystème d'une croissance économique 
s'élevant à 2,1 % en 2018, 1,9 % en 2019 et 1,7 % en 2020 demeurent cohérentes avec la 
poursuite d’une reprise solide et généralisée ; l'économie française, parfois considérée 
comme une bonne approximation de la moyenne de la zone euro, devrait suivre une 
trajectoire de croissance comparable, à 1,8 %, 1,7 % et 1,6 % en 2020 selon la Banque de 
France. 
Concernant les perspectives d'inflation, en tant que composante de l'ajustement durable de 
la trajectoire de l'inflation, les récentes projections des services de la BCE et de 
l'Eurosystème sont devenues de plus en plus stables, renforçant notre confiance dans le fait 
que l'amélioration de la croissance économique que nous avons observée se traduira par 
une hausse des salaires et de l'inflation. En d'autres termes, si nous sommes peut-être un 
peu moins certains du point où nous nous situons dans le cycle, nous sommes cependant 
plus confiants sur le fait que nous allons dans la bonne direction en ce qui concerne 
l'inflation. 
Décisions de politique monétaire 
Quand le Conseil des gouverneurs mettra-t-il un terme aux achats nets d'actifs ? Quand 
annoncera-t-il cette décision ? Ces questions étaient restées sans réponse et donnaient lieu 
à des spéculations de la part des marchés avant notre réunion à Riga. Outre les célèbres et 
importants trois « P » – persévérance, patience et prudence – les décisions du Conseil des 
gouverneurs sont également guidées par trois « C » : crédibilité, cohérence et clarté. Chacun 
de ces éléments est important. 
<U+F0B7> Crédibilité : Nos mesures sont crédibles car elles respectent notre mandat et nos 
prévisions économiques, en particulier s'agissant des perspectives d'inflation. Et nous 
avons été manifestement bien avisés de ne pas modifier la cible d'inflation de 2 % 
ces dernières années en dépit des nombreux appels en ce sens.  
<U+F0B7> Cohérence : Nous avons agi en cohérence avec nos annonces précédentes, comme 
nous l'avions déjà fait en décembre 2016 et en octobre 2017. Cette cohérence a 
contribué à l'« alignement des planètes » que nous observons au moins depuis mars 
entre le point de vue du Conseil des gouverneurs et ceux des prévisionnistes 
extérieurs, y compris pour ce qui concerne les anticipations des marchés. Il était 
important d'annoncer la fin des achats nets d'actifs dès que nous avons senti que les 
critères de l'ajustement durable de la trajectoire de l'inflation seraient remplis. 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
<U+F0B7> Clarté : L'incertitude est aujourd'hui l'ennemi numéro un de la croissance et de la 
stabilité financière. En fournissant des indications claires sur le calendrier des achats 
d'actifs et la trajectoire des taux d'intérêt – une fois encore plusieurs mois à l'avance 
– nous avons fait de notre mieux pour réduire l'incertitude concernant les conditions 
futures de politique monétaire, au moins jusqu'à l'horizon auquel il est prudent de le 
faire. 
La cohérence, la crédibilité et la clarté des décisions prises à Riga ont été renforcées par le 
fait qu'elles ont été prises à l’unanimité, ce qui démontre la forte cohésion au sein du Conseil 
des gouverneurs. Dans ce monde divisé, dans cette Europe divisée – malheureusement sur 
des sujets difficiles tels que l'immigration – cette cohésion est la responsabilité et le devoir 
que nous partageons pour protéger le bien commun de 340 millions d'Européens : leur 
monnaie, l'euro. Ils la soutiennent à une écrasante majorité, 74 %, confirmée par 
l'Eurobaromètre du printemps 2018, dont une majorité croissante en Italie. Cette confiance 
dans l'euro nous oblige à agir ensemble.  
J'aimerais saluer ici un autre engagement positif récemment pris par nos dirigeants 
politiques : l'accord franco-allemand de Meseberg. Le message est clair et de trois ordres : 
i. En complément de l'Union monétaire, la zone euro a besoin d'un renforcement de 
l'Union économique. Faute de quoi la politique monétaire restera la seule option 
possible, avec le risque d'être exagérément sollicitée lors de la prochaine récession. 
ii. L'Union économique nécessite un partage des risques publics - un MES renforcé et 
un budget pour la zone euro – ainsi qu'un partage des risques privés. Permettez-moi 
d'insister sur ce point, en ajoutant une Union bancaire - avec un mécanisme de 
résolution complètement fiable – et une Union des marchés de capitaux (UMC). 
L'UMC – dont nous sommes, avec le président Jens Weidmann et l'ensemble du 
Conseil des gouverneurs, de fervents partisans - figure heureusement elle aussi dans 
la Déclaration, avec l'engagement de réaliser des « progrès décisifs ». 
iii. L'Europe a besoin d'une impulsion franco-allemande. Ces deux pays ont pris leurs 
responsabilités quand il en était encore temps. C'est maintenant aux 19 d'élaborer un 
paquet de mesures commun et opérationnel. La zone euro devra saisir cette 
opportunité : c'est maintenant ou jamais. 
II. L’incertitude induite par les politiques économiques 
L’économie mondiale et européenne est confrontée à deux chocs possibles : un choc de 
politique commerciale et un choc de politique budgétaire. Comme nous sommes en pleine 
Coupe du monde de football, il semble approprié de dire qu’avec ces politiques, on marque 
des buts contre son propre camp.  
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Montée du protectionnisme 
Le premier défi est le risque posé par la montée du protectionnisme pour le système 
commercial mondial. Les mesures initiales annoncées jusqu’à présent par les États-Unis, 
puis par la Chine, concernent seulement 1 % environ des importations mondiales et 
devraient avoir des effets directs limités sur l’inflation et sur l’activité. Mais elles ont, en toute 
logique, suscité des représailles de la part d’autres pays ou régions, et le risque d’escalade 
et de guerre commerciale mondiale n’est plus à écarter.  
D’après l’analyse classique de l’impact macroéconomique d’une augmentation des tarifs 
douaniers, il s’agit d’un choc d’offre négatif impliquant un arbitrage entre baisse de la 
production et hausse des prix, au moins à court terme. Les études qui s’appuient sur cette 
approche plutôt mécanique tendent à constater des effets significatifs mais néanmoins 
relativement limités. Le FMI, par exemple, a étudié le scénario assez sévère d’une 
augmentation mondiale des tarifs douaniers se traduisant par une hausse de 10 % des prix 
des importations, mais en a conclu que cela entraînerait seulement une diminution de 15 % 
du commerce mondial et une baisse de 2 % environ du PIB mondial au bout de trois ans. 
Ce type d’analyse, à mon avis, sous-estime gravement les effets éventuels, car il ne tient 
pas compte du choc de confiance susceptible de se manifester via deux canaux. 
Premièrement, l’incertitude peut accentuer l’aversion au risque sur les marchés financiers et 
réduire l’offre de crédit. Deuxièmement, une perte de confiance des entreprises risque de 
décourager l’investissement. Ces deux canaux d’incertitude tendent à peser sur la demande. 
En outre, ils peuvent se concentrer en début de période et survenir avant même l’entrée en 
vigueur de toute restriction commerciale. En effet, même en l’absence de restriction 
commerciale supplémentaire concrète, les dégâts peuvent être faits. 
Le Brexit constitue un bon exemple de conséquences subies avant toute réalisation 
concrète. À ce stade, le Royaume-Uni a réalisé un référendum et activé l’article 50, mais il 
ne quittera pas l’Union européenne avant mars de l’année prochaine : il n’y a encore ni tarifs 
douaniers ni barrières commerciales. Cependant, la livre sterling a baissé immédiatement 
après l’annonce des résultats du référendum, reflétant l’anticipation d’une détérioration future 
des conditions commerciales extérieures ; cette évolution a fortement nui au pouvoir d’achat 
des ménages britanniques. L’investissement des entreprises s’est ralenti – comme cela 
semble avoir été le cas au Canada en raison de l’incertitude liée à l’ALENA. La Banque 
d’Angleterre estime que le PIB en volume du Royaume-Uni est déjà inférieur de 1¾ %-2 % 
au niveau qui aurait été atteint en l’absence du Brexit. 
Politique budgétaire 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
La politique budgétaire menée dans de nombreuses économies avancées est une seconde 
source d’incertitude induite par les politiques économiques. La dette publique a augmenté de 
manière significative depuis la Grande récession. La dette brute moyenne des 
administrations publiques de la zone euro est passée de 65 % du PIB environ en 2007 à un 
pic supérieur à 90 % en 2014, et elle est encore supérieure à 85 % aujourd’hui en dépit de 
l’amélioration des soldes primaires en moyenne dans la zone. 
Les coûts macroéconomiques de l’incertitude budgétaire se font sentir même en l’absence 
de véritable crise de la dette souveraine. Les primes de risque augmentent et accroissent le 
coût des emprunts sans qu’il y ait, pour autant,  d’ajustement à la hausse  de la rémunération 
du risque pour les épargnants. Les risques liés à l’incertitude budgétaire sont hautement non 
linéaires et l’on pourrait presque dire binaires, en raison de la fonction de réaction des 
marchés financiers, comme nous l’avons observé depuis 2010 dans la zone euro. En deçà 
d’un certain seuil, l’incertitude budgétaire a des effets très limités sur les écarts de 
rendement des emprunts souverains ou sur l’activité économique. Mais dès que la dette 
atteint des niveaux qui remettent en question sa soutenabilité, au moins pour certains 
investisseurs, il y a un risque de crise auto-réalisatrice. Cette incertitude peut peser 
lourdement sur l’investissement et sur la croissance. 
III. La réponse de la politique monétaire à l’incertitude induite par les politiques 
économiques 
Quelle réponse les banques centrales doivent-elles apporter à cette incertitude ? J’aimerais 
revenir aux trois « C » que j’évoquais précédemment : crédibilité, cohérence et clarté. 
Afin de préserver notre crédibilité, nous devons nous conformer à notre mandat de maintien 
de la stabilité des prix. À cet égard, je souhaiterais préciser que nous avons davantage de 
certitude en ce qui concerne la trajectoire de l’inflation que pour celle de la croissance. Un 
choc protectionniste serait incontestablement mauvais pour la croissance mais son effet sur 
l’inflation serait plus ambigu, au moins à court terme. Un niveau durablement élevé des prix 
du pétrole serait tout aussi négatif pour la croissance mais alimenterait l’inflation. 
Se conformer à notre mandat, c’est aussi ne pas se soumettre à des préoccupations 
budgétaires. La relation entre politique monétaire et politique budgétaire dépend, en 
définitive, de qui détermine le niveau des prix. Le risque avec les régimes à prépondérance 
budgétaire c’est que l’inflation augmente parallèlement à la dette publique car on s’attend, au 
final, à ce qu’elle soit financée par la banque centrale. De nos jours, le rôle d’une banque 
centrale est sans ambiguïté sur ce point – il ne peut y avoir de prépondérance budgétaire et 
la trajectoire de l’inflation est fixée par la banque centrale. Non seulement le financement 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
monétaire est interdit aux banques centrales, mais le calendrier des décisions de politique 
monétaire n’est pas déterminé par les problèmes budgétaires des États membres.  
Le deuxième « C » est celui de la cohérence. Les modèles théoriques prennent souvent 
comme hypothèse l’existence d’une fonction de réaction de la banque centrale. Un outil 
puissant de stabilisation de la production et de l’inflation peut être une fonction de réaction 
bien comprise par le public, car les courbes de rendement peuvent s’ajuster en anticipation 
d’une politique monétaire future conforme à l’évolution des perspectives pour l’économie. 
Pour revenir à ma référence au football, Mervyn King a appelé cela la théorie des taux 
d’intérêt de Maradona. Mais les fonctions de réaction crédibles ne tombent pas du ciel et 
s’acquièrent au prix d’une communication et d’une action cohérentes au fil du temps. Nous 
sommes et resterons prévisibles pour nos partenaires. Dans sa forward guidance, le Conseil 
des gouverneurs a également indiqué son intention d’agir progressivement et en fonction 
des données disponibles. Face à l’incertitude quant à la vigueur du mécanisme de 
transmission, nous devrions nous laisser guider par le pragmatisme – le niveau d’inflation 
par rapport à l’objectif de moyen terme – et le gradualisme. 
Le dernier « C » est celui de la clarté. Les banquiers centraux devraient essayer d’expliciter 
autant que possible ce qu’ils feront et ne feront pas. Sur la première partie, nous avons été 
clairs à Riga ; sur la seconde, je voudrais souligner que nous ne pouvons compenser 
intégralement l’incertitude créée par d’autres décideurs ; et nous ne pouvons pas non plus 
contrebalancer leurs effets. Nous avons montré au cours des dernières années que la 
politique monétaire est flexible, et nous nous sommes montrés disposés à utiliser tout 
instrument dans le cadre de notre mandat afin de remédier à une inflation trop faible. Nous 
sommes allés bien au-delà de ce que l’on pensait être possible et nous ferons tout ce qui est 
nécessaire pour remplir notre mandat de maintien de la stabilité des prix – ni plus ni moins. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être ici aujourd’hui pour faire l’ouverture de ce Forum financier 
international consacré à « l’Europe dans un monde disruptif ». Nous sommes 
en 2018, à Paris. Mais je souhaiterais tout d’abord retourner plusieurs millénaires en 
arrière, en Mésopotamie. L’invention de l’écriture fut certainement l’une des percées 
les plus stupéfiantes de l’histoire de l’humanité, s’agissant notamment de l’accès aux 
connaissances et de leur diffusion. C’est précisément ce que nous pouvons appeler 
une véritable disruption. Le philosophe français Michel Serres compare ainsi souvent 
notre époque de révolution digitale à l’invention de l’écriture. Dans mes remarques 
d’aujourd’hui, je souhaite souligner que nous nous trouvons aujourd’hui à un 
tournant : nous vivons la fin d’un cycle de remise en ordre après la crise financière et 
nous assistons à l’émergence d’un autre cycle de disruption en Europe 
**  
I. La fin d’un cycle 
Les questions qui ont dominé la période d’après-crise – le renforcement de la 
réglementation financière et la mise en œuvre des mesures non conventionnelles de 
politique monétaire – touchent à leur fin. La finalisation très bienvenue des réformes 
de Bâle III – qui devront être intégrées en temps voulu dans la législation 
européenne – couronne une décennie d’initiatives réglementaires concernant le 
secteur bancaire. Nous n’en avons bien évidemment pas encore terminé. Il reste 
surtout deux priorités à l’ordre du jour : premièrement, la révision européenne de la 
directive Solvabilité II sur les assurances ; le principal défi consistera à mieux 
concilier les exigences prudentielles et l’accroissement des investissements en 
actions et en infrastructures. Soyons clairs : une révision, ce ne peut pas signifier le 
statu quo. La seconde priorité est la réglementation de la finance non bancaire 
(shadow banking), et avant tout sa liquidité. En effet, la priorité réglementaire n’est 
plus la solvabilité des banques mais la liquidité des non-banques. 
Dans la zone euro, la croissance économique et l’inflation ont été soutenues avec 
succès par nos mesures de politique monétaire non conventionnelles. Le PIB par 
tête et l’emploi ont dépassé leurs niveaux de 2007. Le Conseil des gouverneurs de la 
BCE met à présent en œuvre sa stratégie de normalisation progressive et prévisible 
de la politique monétaire. Les achats nets d’actifs devraient prendre fin en 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
décembre ; le premier relèvement des taux d’intérêt pourrait intervenir au plus tôt à 
partir de l’été 2019 en fonction des perspectives d’inflation. Cela dit, la politique 
monétaire ne doit pas rester la seule partie à jouer et la zone euro doit se doter 
d’autres instruments économiques. Une Union économique plus forte est une 
combinaison efficace entre le partage du risque privé – Union bancaire et Union des 
marchés de capitaux – et le partage du risque public – MES renforcé et budget.  
La fin progressive de ce cycle de « rétablissement » signifie que le contenu de notre 
dialogue entre secteur financier et autorités publiques va changer. Il portera moins 
sur nos mantras bien connus : les exigences de fonds propres sont-elles trop 
élevées ? Les taux d’intérêt sont-ils trop bas ? Et nous nous concentrerons 
davantage, je l’espère, sur les enjeux de demain. Permettez-moi, au début de ce 
nouveau cycle de disruption, d’évoquer trois défis : une nouvelle constellation 
financière en Europe ; de nouveaux besoins et de nouveaux acteurs ; de nouvelles 
technologies et donc de nouvelles réglementations.  
 
II. Le début d’un autre cycle ? 
Le premier défi a trait à l’émergence d’une nouvelle constellation financière en 
Europe. Le Brexit est, et reste, une mauvaise nouvelle, non seulement pour le 
Royaume-Uni mais également pour l’Europe. Il est hautement souhaitable de 
parvenir à un accord pour préserver la prospérité économique des deux côtés de la 
Manche : les derniers efforts entrepris semblent aller dans cette direction. Le Brexit 
entraînera, cependant, une restructuration du système financier européen. Il n’y aura 
pas une City unique pour le continent, mais plutôt un réseau polycentrique intégré de 
places financières, avec des spécialisations fondées sur les domaines d’expertise. 
Cette structure doit contribuer à améliorer la circulation de l’épargne abondante en 
zone euro – plus de 400 milliards d’euros d’excédent – en l’orientant davantage vers 
le financement par émission d’actions et l’innovation. L’Union des marchés de 
capitaux en Europe – et ce que j’appelle plus largement une « Union de financement 
pour l’investissement et l’innovation » – est encore plus indispensable dans la 
perspective du Brexit.  
 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
Dans ce nouvel environnement, la zone euro doit garder le contrôle des risques 
relatifs aux transactions en euros. Certaines infrastructures des marchés financiers 
situées à Londres deviendront bientôt extérieures à l’UE. Réduire la dépendance vis-
à-vis de ces infrastructures est essentiel pour l’UE tant en termes de stabilité 
financière que de transmission de la politique monétaire. C’est la raison pour laquelle 
la Commission a proposé une politique de localisation des contreparties centrales, 
dans le cadre de la révision du règlement sur les infrastructures de marché 
européennes (EMIR), ce que nous soutenons fermement, de même que l’Allemagne 
et la plupart des États membres. Cette proposition est en discussion au Parlement 
européen et au Conseil. Nous devons également nous assurer que les acteurs 
essentiels ne deviennent pas « trop grands pour faire faillite » (« too big to fail ») : un 
monopole pour les activités de compensation au service du marché financier 
européen doit être exclu. L’exemple – et le succès – du développement à Paris d’une 
offre concurrente pour la compensation des CDS montre qu’il est possible de briser 
un monopole s’il existe une convergence des volontés entre les acteurs. 
À cet égard, Paris a de nombreux atouts pour devenir un pôle majeur pour le 
financement de l’innovation en Europe. La France compte quatre des huit banques 
systémiques de la zone euro. En outre, avec 4 000 milliards d’euros sous gestion 
dans le pays, le secteur français de la gestion d’actifs inclut le leader européen de la 
gestion d’actifs. Le secteur français de l’assurance représente plus d’un tiers du 
secteur de l’assurance de la zone euro. Je constate qu’au-delà des décisions 
juridiques sur les structures européennes, un nombre toujours croissant de banques 
internationales implantent à Paris la majorité de leurs activités de marché. Paris a 
tous les atouts pour devenir le « hub marché » de cette nouvelle constellation en 
zone euro. 
 
2/ Deuxième défi : de nouveaux besoins et de nouveaux acteurs L’activité 
bancaire telle que nous la connaissons, avec des dépôts, de l’épargne et des prêts, 
restera fondamentale. Mais l’industrie des paiements, par exemple, est en 
constante évolution, notamment avec les FinTech. Dans le passé, les paiements 
étaient considérés comme une question technique de back office. Ce n’est plus le 
cas. Nous identifions trois tendances majeures : tout d’abord, l’instantanéité des 
paiements, « à tout moment, partout » - ; puis, la dématérialisation ; et enfin, la 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
dissémination – avec une multitude d’acteurs entrant sur le marché. Dans ce 
contexte, il est nécessaire de développer une véritable stratégie industrielle 
européenne ; et des acteurs européens, au sein d’un cadre harmonisé et compétitif. 
Le modèle économique associé est ici manifestement différent, fondé non plus sur 
les marges d’intermédiation ou le paiement de frais, mais sur la valeur des données, 
sur laquelle je reviendrai un peu plus tard.  
Un autre besoin, le financement par fonds propres, revêt une importance 
croissante : il est crucial dans les économies innovantes. Le financement par fonds 
propres est plus adapté que le financement par endettement aux rendements 
incertains et souvent à long terme qui sont associés aux projets innovants. Les 
actions de sociétés ne représentent que 74 % du PIB dans la zone euro, contre 
125 % aux États-Unis. L’écosystème du capital-risque de l’UE accuse encore un 
retard par rapport à celui des États-Unis. En 2017, les investisseurs en capital-risque 
ont investi environ 9 milliards 
i
 d’euros dans la zone euro, contre 60 milliards d’euros 
ii
 aux États-Unis. De plus, les fonds américains de capital-risque sont en moyenne 
trois fois plus importants que les fonds européens
iii
. En conséquence, au-delà d’un 
certain montant, les start-ups européennes sont contraintes de chercher leur 
financement à l’étranger, principalement aux États-Unis. À cet égard, la France est 
en train de combler l’écart. En 2017, les sociétés françaises de capital-risque ont levé 
davantage de fonds que leurs homologues britanniques et devraient prospérer 
en 2018. 
Enfin, nous devons également promouvoir le financement des investissements 
verts et à faible émission de carbone, tout en prenant en compte les risques liés 
au climat. À cet effet, la Banque de France a lancé avec succès le Réseau des 
banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système financier 
(NGFS), qui réunit d’ores et déjà 21 banques centrales, superviseurs et organisations 
internationales. 
 
3/ J’en viens à présent au troisième défi de cette nouvelle ère : les nouvelles 
technologies et les nouvelles réglementations qu’elles impliquent. Il va sans dire 
que la French Tech, est une priorité stratégique pour Paris : prenez par exemple 
l’ouverture récente du campus de start-ups Station F. Mais ce n’est pas seulement – 
ni même principalement – une question de Fintech : c’est potentiellement une 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
question de Big Tech – ces gigantesques plateformes de données basées aux États-
Unis ou en Chine – ; et il s’agit certainement d’une question pour les grandes 
institutions financières existantes. Ces structures déjà en place s’accordent toutes à 
présent sur le fait que la révolution numérique constitue leur défi primordial et 
existentiel. La capacité des institutions financières à retenir leurs clients, des 
agences au smartphone, a été mise à rude épreuve. La réponse doit avant tout venir 
des institutions elles-mêmes. Mais les réglementations doivent elles aussi s’adapter : 
« même activité, même régulation », bien sûr, et les Big Tech devront appliquer les 
mêmes règles que les banques et les sociétés d’assurance si elles exercent les 
mêmes activités financières réglementées.  
Cela étant, le défi qui se pose aux superviseurs va au-delà de la seule 
réglementation financière ; ce défi est celui de la bonne et équitable application à 
tous de trois régulations plus larges : la protection des données, la surveillance de la 
concurrence et de la concentration, et la cybersécurité. La protection des données 
est renforcée par l’entrée en vigueur du Règlement général sur la protection des 
données le 25 mai. La concurrence est de plus en plus remise en cause par des 
situations où « le gagnant remporte toute la mise ». La cybersécurité sera l’une des 
priorités de la présidence française du G7 l’année prochaine. Ces trois défis – la 
protection des données, la lutte contre les monopoles, la cybersécurité – ne se 
traiteront que par une coopération internationale nettement plus forte. Face à la 
révolution numérique, personne ne doit s’attendre pour autant à ce que régulation – 
nécessaire – signifie protection des situations existantes. La seule réponse efficace, 
c’est évidemment l’innovation. 
** 
En conclusion, permettez-moi de citer une phrase souvent attribuée à 
Albert Einstein : « La créativité est contagieuse, transmettez-la. » À la Banque de 
France et à l’ACPR, nous ne prétendons pas avoir le génie d’Albert Einstein, mais 
nous souhaitons ardemment encourager l’innovation. Le pôle de l’innovation FinTech 
de l’ACPR et son groupe de travail sur l’intelligence artificielle constituent une bonne 
illustration de ces efforts. Mais cela va beaucoup plus loin : la Banque de France 
s’engage à être l’une des meilleures banques centrales pour les marchés au sein de 
l’Eurosystème. Notre expertise est reconnue et soutient la place financière de Paris.

de vos forces. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence ACPR  
Paris, 18 septembre 2018 
 
Discours d’ouverture de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) 
 
« La supervision financière et le rôle des autorités nationales en Europe »

M. le Président [M. Draghi], Mme la Présidente [D. Nouy], Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Bonjour et bienvenue à Paris, 
C’est un réel plaisir de vous accueillir à cette conférence sur la supervision financière et le 
rôle des autorités nationales en Europe. Quelle meilleure façon d’inaugurer les nouveaux 
locaux de l’ACPR – l’autorité française de supervision – que d’y réunir des collègues et des 
experts de tout le continent. Je vous invite à regarder quelques noms de rues dans les 
environs, car nous sommes ici dans le quartier de Paris appelé « quartier de l’Europe » – 
tout à fait dans l’esprit de ce que nous faisons ensemble avec le MSU. 
Je remercie chaleureusement le Président Mario Draghi d’être venu. Avant de lui laisser la 
parole, je voudrais souligner que nous avons toutes les raisons d’être fiers de ce qui a été 
accompli pour l’Union bancaire ces dernières années. Mais nous ne devons pas être 
complaisants. Il y a deux priorités : une sur le fond et une sur la méthode. 
** 
I. Notre priorité sur le fond : renforcer le second pilier sur la résolution 
À présent que le Mécanisme de surveillance unique (MSU) est en place et opérationnel 
depuis quatre ans, on oublie facilement que de nombreux sceptiques étaient à l’époque 
persuadés qu’il serait impossible de réaliser une union de ce type. Mais, comme l’aurait dit 
Mark Twain, « [nous] ne savions pas que c’était impossible, alors [nous] l’avons fait ». 
Aujourd’hui, c’est une réalité tangible. En effet, nos pratiques en matière de surveillance 
prudentielle ont été harmonisées par le haut. Notre cadre juridique est plus solide grâce au 
corpus réglementaire unique (single rulebook). Et les banques européennes sont plus 
solides – le ratio de solvabilité CET1 des grands établissements a augmenté de plus de 
3 points depuis 2014 (passant de 11,3 % à 14,6 % à la fin de l’année dernière). Danièle 
[Nouy], vous méritez nos félicitations pour cette réussite ! 
Cependant, le second pilier de l’Union bancaire, le Mécanisme de résolution unique (MRU), 
n’est pas encore achevé. Certes, nous avons déjà géré avec succès nos premiers cas et 
amélioré substantiellement la santé de plusieurs banques, notamment en Espagne et en 
Italie. Mais, notre principale priorité doit être de rendre le MRU totalement opérationnel.  
À mon avis, la clé se trouve dans la mise en place d’un filet de sécurité commun (common 
backstop) au Fonds de résolution unique. L’expérience des pays étrangers est 
instructive : dans la plupart des grandes juridictions, notamment aux États-Unis et au 
Royaume-Uni, les capacités d’intervention des fonds de résolution sont sécurisées par les 
autorités budgétaires, sans constituer une charge pour les finances publiques, puisque les 
éventuelles mises de fonds publiques sont généralement remboursées par le secteur privé. 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
L’accord sur le filet de sécurité auquel est parvenue la zone euro le 29 juin dernier est une 
première étape essentielle. Il est maintenant urgent de le mettre en œuvre d’ici la fin de 
l’année. Il reste deux questions essentielles : comment financer le filet de sécurité à un 
niveau suffisamment élevé pour être crédible, et comment créer un processus de 
décision rapide pour traiter les urgences – s’il nous faut des semaines, c’est inutile. La 
zone euro a également besoin d’un schéma de fourniture de liquidité pouvant bénéficier à 
des banques financièrement assainies après la résolution – un système qui soit prévu par 
l’Eurosystème et qui s’appuie sur une garantie publique de qualité élevée.  
Je suis pleinement convaincu que dès lors que nous aurons un mécanisme de résolution 
crédible et efficace, il sera beaucoup plus facile de parvenir à un compromis pragmatique en 
matière de garantie des dépôts, probablement en mettant l’accent sur le partage de la 
liquidité entre mécanismes nationaux de garantie des dépôts. 
J’aimerais ajouter deux réflexions portant sur le fond : 
- la première concerne la lutte contre le blanchiment d’argent. Dans ce domaine, je suis 
convaincu que nous devons renforcer notre approche en nous appuyant sur un réseau 
formé des autorités nationales et de l’ABE, qui devrait garantir une surveillance unique 
efficace en matière de lutte contre le blanchiment. Cela signifie que l’ABE doit être dotée 
des compétences juridiques et humaines nécessaires pour favoriser la convergence des 
pratiques vers les meilleures normes, dans le cadre de mandats européens clairs. Ces 
compétences devraient même inclure le contrôle des infractions à la loi et la capacité 
d’intervenir directement dans certains cas ayant un impact à l’échelle européenne.   
- deuxièmement, ce que nous avons réussi sur les banques peut être un exemple pour les 
marchés financiers. Si nous voulons vraiment renforcer l’intégration financière afin de 
favoriser un meilleur partage des risques entre les acteurs privés (private risk sharing) et 
une plus grande convergence en Europe, nous devons progresser sur le projet de l’Union 
des marchés de capitaux : nous devons en particulier renforcer le rôle de l’Autorité 
européenne des marchés financiers (AEMF) en tant qu’autorité de contrôle, du moins 
en ce qui concerne la surveillance des marchés de gros – tout en faisant dûment appel 
aux autorités nationales le cas échéant. Le président de l’AMF défend avec talent cette 
évolution.  
 
II. Notre priorité s’agissant de la méthode : développer des synergies au sein 
du MSU dans son ensemble 
Permettez-moi de revenir au MSU. Après seulement quatre années d’existence, il est à 
présent pleinement opérationnel, avec plus de 2 300 décisions prudentielles prises sur la 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
seule année 2017. Ceux d’entre vous qui travaillent au sein du MSU sont la preuve vivante 
de la réalité de l’intégration européenne. Vous prouvez chaque jour qu’une coopération et 
une union plus étroites ne sont pas un rêve appartenant au passé mais quelque chose dont 
nous sommes encore capables aujourd’hui.  
Le succès du MSU tient en partie à sa conception : le mécanisme constitue un modèle 
original de fédéralisme, fondé sur une collaboration étroite et permanente entre la BCE et 
les autorités nationales à tous les niveaux : de la composition du Conseil de surveillance 
prudentielle aux équipes de surveillance prudentielle conjointes (Joint Supervisory Teams - 
JST), aux équipes de contrôle sur place et aux détachements de personnel.  
Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que tout va pour le mieux ni que les cultures et les pratiques 
ont totalement convergé au sein du MSU. Le succès nous permet de réfléchir à présent à la 
manière dont le fonctionnement du MSU peut encore être amélioré. À mon avis, il existe 
trois grandes priorités stratégiques :  
- la première : simplifier encore les processus. Je salue les initiatives actuelles, 
notamment la création du Groupe de simplification, présidé par Petra Senkovic de la 
BCE et Édouard Fernandez-Bollo de l’ACPR. Différentes mesures sont en cours 
d’élaboration, comme le recours croissant aux délégations, la rationalisation du 
fonctionnement du SREP ou des JST. Toutefois, un défi essentiel consistera à s’assurer 
que tous les processus resteront optimisés au fil du temps et que la simplification 
devienne, de manière pérenne, partie intégrante de la prise de décision, de la conception 
à l’exécution. Pour cela, la simplification doit devenir l’une des valeurs qui guident le 
MSU.  
- deuxième priorité : encourager la mobilité, notamment grâce aux détachements de 
personnel et au développement des contrôles sur place dans des banques à l’extérieur 
du pays d’origine des contrôleurs. D’autres initiatives pourraient comprendre des 
échanges de personnel pour une durée très courte ou bien des permutations au sein des 
JST, entre la BCE et les autorités nationales, afin de permettre aux membres de mieux 
comprendre la culture et les pratiques de leurs homologues. 
- troisième et dernière priorité : développer les synergies. Tout comme l’Eurosystème, 
l’Union bancaire constitue un système avec un centre fort et des composantes nationales 
fortes, qui, in fine, doivent agir comme une seule équipe. L’objectif est d’utiliser au mieux 
les ressources nationales en favorisant leur participation à toutes les missions 
importantes du MSU. Les autorités nationales ne doivent pas hésiter à s’engager 
davantage dans le MSU. En retour, la BCE devrait leur donner plus de pouvoir, 
notamment dans le cadre de la surveillance prudentielle au quotidien et dans le domaine 
des contrôles sur place dans les succursales ou les filiales des établissements 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
importants. S’agissant de la France, la BCE peut évidemment s’appuyer sur l’ACPR : ses 
agents et ses inspecteurs, dont la formation est très solide, sont pleinement engagés à 
œuvrer pour le bien commun du MSU aux côtés de leurs collègues de la BCE. Des 
efforts supplémentaires sont encore nécessaires pour supprimer les lourdeurs 
administratives et ainsi faciliter les contrôles sur places et les missions transfrontières. 
Mais je peux déjà vous dire que l’ACPR vise à doubler son objectif de  missions 
transfrontières en 2019. 
Une coopération étroite entre les autorités nationales et la BCE est nécessaire en matière de 
supervision bancaire, mais pas exclusivement. N’oublions pas que la majorité des autorités 
nationales sont compétentes dans d’autres domaines de supervision, importants pour le 
MSU, tels que le secteur des assurances. C’est le cas de l’ACPR. Ces compétences sont 
utiles non seulement pour la supervision des conglomérats financiers mais également pour 
le développement d’un marché unique plus unifié pour l’assurance. En coopération avec 
l’Autorité européenne des assurances et des pensions (AEAPP), nous sommes déterminés à 
le préserver après le Brexit. 
** 
Permettez-moi à présent de conclure. Dix  ans après la faillite de Lehman Brothers, nous 
avons appris trois leçons importantes. Premièrement, nous avons besoin d’une supervision 
compétente, forte et indépendante. Deuxièmement, nous avons besoin d’un level playing 
field au moins européen, et si possible international, dans la mise en œuvre des règles 
renforcées : sans supervision exigeante, la régulation et le single rulebook peuvent rester 
très théoriques. Et surtout, nous devons toujours rester vigilants sur la question de la stabilité 
financière. Les anniversaires doivent nous éviter la tentation de l’oubli et de 
l’assoupissement. De tout cela, le MSU est à la fois le fruit... et, sous votre responsabilité, la 
garantie pour l’avenir. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Séminaire bancaire international annuel du groupe des Trente 
14 octobre 2018 
 
Remarques de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
“ La politique monétaire dans l’environnement actuel :  
réconcilier clarté et flexibilité, ainsi qu’indépendance et coopération ”

Bonjour, je souhaite tout d’abord remercier les organisateurs de ce séminaire de me donner 
l’occasion de m’exprimer devant un auditoire d’une telle qualité. 
Je voudrais évoquer deux défis. Le premier est interne à la zone euro : il concerne la façon 
dont nous, banquiers centraux de la zone euro, décidons et communiquons au sujet de la 
normalisation progressive de notre politique monétaire dans une période d’incertitudes. Le 
second défi est collectif : comment nous nous coordonnons face à des trajectoires 
économiques divergentes. 
** 
1. Notre défi interne à la zone euro : conjuguer clarté et flexibilité 
La zone euro connaît actuellement une expansion économique généralisée. Le deuxième 
trimestre 2018 a été le 21
ème
 trimestre consécutif de croissance économique. 9,2 millions 
d’emplois ont été créés depuis 2013 et le taux de chômage est revenu de 12,1 % à 8,1 %, 
même si ce chiffre demeure encore trop élevé. On observe des signes croissants de 
tensions sur le marché du travail et la croissance des salaires nominaux s’accélère : la 
courbe de Philips est de nouveau à l’œuvre, bien qu’un peu plus tardivement que prévu. 
L’écart de production (output gap) était probablement comblé à la fin de l’année dernière. 
Nous sommes de plus en plus confiants dans un retour durable de l’inflation vers notre 
objectif, notre prévision de 1,7 % chaque année en 2018, 2019 et 2020 justifiant notre 
décision prise à l’unanimité en juin de poursuivre une stratégie de normalisation progressive. 
Il existe toutefois des incertitudes croissantes : le protectionnisme pourrait peser sur la 
confiance des chefs d’entreprise et l’investissement ; de nombreux pays émergents 
rencontrent des difficultés en raison des choix de politique économique aux États-Unis – une 
normalisation justifiée de la politique monétaire dans un contexte de relance budgétaire 
moins justifiée, et des valorisations sur les marchés financiers qui demeurent tendues malgré 
la récente correction. Au sein de l’Europe, la politique budgétaire italienne est suivie de près 
par les investisseurs. Et enfin il y a le Brexit, même si son impact macroéconomique direct 
sur la zone euro devrait être faible. 
Comment réagir face à cette incertitude ? En combinant deux objectifs apparemment 
contradictoires, la clarté et la flexibilité. 
La clarté – Notre devoir, en tant que décideurs, est de fournir des repères permettant de 
guider les acteurs économiques et les marchés financiers dans un brouillard d’incertitudes 
de plus en plus dense. Pour que nos indications soient fiables, nous devons être aussi clairs, 
crédibles et cohérents que possible. Nous ne pouvons pas être clairs comme un horaire des 
trains, mais plutôt comme le capitaine qui fixe le cap et s’adapte au vent et aux vagues. La 
séquence des étapes vers la normalisation de notre politique monétaire est donc très 
 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
prévisible : premièrement, nous avons réduit de moitié nos achats d’actifs ce mois-ci, les 
ramenant à 15 milliards d’euros et nous y mettrons probablement fin en décembre. 
Deuxièmement, nous définissons un axe de direction avec notre forward guidance à long 
terme : nous maintiendrons les taux d’intérêt à leurs niveaux actuels au moins jusqu’à 
l’été 2019. Et troisièmement, nous conserverons notre stock d’actifs aussi longtemps que 
nécessaire pour maintenir des conditions de liquidité favorables et un degré élevé de soutien 
monétaire. De plus, cette séquence ne dépend pas des incertitudes budgétaires qui peuvent 
apparaître dans certains États membres. La position du Conseil des gouverneurs est claire 
sur le fait qu’il n’y a pas de prépondérance budgétaire (fiscal dominance) dans la zone euro 
et qu’aucune politique budgétaire nationale n’influence notre politique monétaire commune. 
La flexibilité – Notre séquence est claire mais les détails de sa mise en œuvre sont flexibles 
et dépendants de la situation. Nous avons inclus plusieurs options pour réagir aux données 
qui nous parviennent. Permettez-moi d’illustrer cela de deux façons :   
<U+F0B7> Une spéculation fréquente porte sur la date précise du premier relèvement des taux 
d’intérêt directeurs et sur leur trajectoire par la suite. À l’évidence, nous devons examiner 
ici l’arbitrage entre plus de clarté aujourd’hui et plus de flexibilité demain. Il est vrai que 
les courbes des taux anticipés sont légèrement volatiles au-delà du second 
semestre 2019. Mais à l’heure actuelle, cette volatilité est relativement faible et il en est 
assurément de même pour les taux d’intérêt qui comptent pour les décisions 
économiques des ménages et des entreprises. Par conséquent, la balance penche 
actuellement vers le maintien d’options ouvertes. J’estime qu’il n’y aurait aucun intérêt à 
troquer notre flexibilité de demain contre plus de clarté aujourd’hui, mais à mesure que 
nous approcherons de l’été 2019, la balance penchera en faveur de la nécessité de 
détailler notre forward guidance. 
<U+F0B7> Nous disposons également de flexibilité s’agissant des réinvestissements. Comme l’a 
indiqué Mario Draghi, nous discuterons bientôt des aspects techniques de nos 
réinvestissements en 2019 afin de garantir la neutralité vis-à-vis du marché. Mais nous 
devons conserver nos options ouvertes s’agissant du calendrier de nos 
réinvestissements au cours des prochaines années. 
Face à l’incertitude, il est souvent fait référence au célèbre « principe de conservatisme » de 
Brainard
i
 (réinterprété par Alan Blinder
ii
). Il ne s’agit pas, comme on l’entend parfois, d’un 
avertissement général appelant à agir prudemment quand le monde est incertain. Le 
« principe de conservatisme » de Brainard dit seulement que vous devez agir prudemment si 
vous n’êtes pas certain de l’effet de votre instrument de politique monétaire sur votre objectif. 
Mais nous devons aller au-delà d’une vision statique du principe de Brainard (se concentrant 
 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
sur une seule petite étape) : une vision dynamique consisterait à inclure la dimension 
temporelle et à déterminer comment gérer et communiquer sur une séquence d’étapes 
graduelles.  
 
2. Notre défi commun face à la divergence : conjuguer indépendance et coopération 
L’économie mondiale poursuit sa forte expansion mais nous constatons à présent une forte 
divergence des performances entre les différents pays. Dans les dernières prévisions du 
FMI, on rencontre très souvent le joli mot français de « plateau » pour décrire la croissance 
mondiale. Mais ce « plateau » n’est pas uniforme : il masque une forte accélération aux 
États-Unis, même si elle est temporaire et fragile, contrebalancée par une modération de la 
croissance dans les autres pays du G7. D’importantes économies émergentes devraient 
rapidement connaître un ralentissement ou n’enregistrer qu’une faible croissance. En 
résumé, nous sommes en train de passer d’une croissance synchronisée à une divergence 
économique. 
Dans de nombreux cas, cette divergence reflète des différences de positionnement dans le 
cycle économique et des chocs idiosyncratiques. Ce qui pourrait en revanche être plus 
inquiétant, d’un point de vue systémique, c’est que certains pays puissent souffrir de la 
hausse actuelle des taux d’intérêt aux États-Unis. En 2013, dans un célèbre article, Hélène 
Rey
iii
 affirmait que des taux de change flottants n’étaient pas suffisants pour que les pays 
ayant un compte de capital ouvert soient indépendants vis-à-vis de la politique monétaire 
américaine. Si le trilemme est en fait un dilemme, alors les pays devront choisir entre 
indépendance monétaire et fermeture de leur compte de capital. 
Je voudrais contester le caractère universel et absolu de son dilemme. Par exemple, je 
pense que la zone euro est capable de fixer son propre cap. Notre programme d’achats 
d’actifs a contribué à un écart de rendement (spread) de plus de 250 points de base sur les 
emprunts publics à 10 ans aux États-Unis et en Allemagne. De même, l’écart entre les taux 
directeurs aux États-Unis et dans la zone euro est le plus important observé depuis 2009. 
Plus techniquement, une règle de Taylor estimée pour la zone euro intégrant la politique 
monétaire américaine comme facteur explicatif ne fait apparaître qu’une très faible 
corrélation entre les deux politiques monétaires. 
Les pays semblent plutôt se répartir le long d’un continuum, allant des pays qui affichent une 
indépendance totale à ceux dont le taux de change est ancré au dollar. Les pays ne sont pas 
tenus d’occuper l’une ou l’autre des positions extrêmes mais peuvent choisir une position 
intermédiaire. Par exemple, imposer des restrictions temporaires aux flux de capitaux 
 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
transfrontières pourrait permettre à un pays de retrouver une indépendance partielle mais 
non totale de sa politique monétaire. 
Mais que peut-on faire de plus pour remédier aux tensions créées par cette divergence 
économique ? En d’autres termes, comment concilier un autre couple tout aussi paradoxal, à 
savoir indépendance et coopération ? 
À l’évidence, la question n’est pas de revenir à l’époque des accords négociés dans des 
suites d’hôtel. Mais nous pouvons et devons agir pour renforcer la coopération entre 
banques centrales. Cette coopération repose sur quatre éléments : 
<U+F0B7> la prévisibilité mutuelle dans l’élaboration de nos politiques monétaires. Nous nous 
rapprocherons le plus d’une solution de coopération si nous évitons les grosses surprises 
entre décideurs. Alors que le multilatéralisme commercial est en risque, le 
multilatéralisme monétaire et financier tient bon, fort heureusement. Cela signifie 
notamment de continuer à favoriser le dialogue et l’échange d’information entre banques 
centrales et d’être très clair sur nos choix de régime de politique monétaire. Nous devons 
apprécier comme elle le mérite la « grande convergence » de nos objectifs au cours des 
quinze dernières années. Dans les principales économies avancées, nous avons 
maintenant une politique de ciblage de l’inflation domestique autour d’un objectif de 2 % 
à moyen terme. 
<U+F0B7> Nous refusons toute guerre des monnaies, comme nous l’avons clairement  affirmé dans 
notre communiqué unanime de Bali : « Nous n’établirons pas de cible de taux de change 
à des fins de concurrence ».  
<U+F0B7> s’agissant des mesures de gestion des flux de capitaux, nous devons apporter notre 
contribution aux réflexions engagées au sein des organisations internationales 
compétentes et donner la priorité aux solutions pratiques et pragmatiques – de type FMI 
– plutôt qu’à une pureté toute dogmatique.  
<U+F0B7> enfin, je ne peux que vous citer, Tharman, ainsi que votre impressionnant rapport EPG : 
« Nous devons impérativement mettre en place un filet de sécurité financier mondial 
avant la prochaine crise » et coordonner ses différentes strates. Cela devrait inclure 
« une facilité permanente de liquidité du FMI ». Le filet de sécurité financier mondial 
constitue la meilleure garantie que nous puissions avoir contre les risques engendrés par 
la divergence économique, et son coût est limité. 
** 
En conclusion, en tant que banquiers centraux, nous devons être prévisibles sans être pré-
engagés. En d’autres termes, nous devons donner de la clarté sans prétendre à la certitude.

agréable, mais l’assurance est un état ridicule »

la certitude, qui n’est ni possible ni souhaitable. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

« Sortir des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Bienvenue à Paris. C’est un plaisir de vous accueillir à la Banque de France pour cette 
conférence sur la sortie des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles. Je dois dire que le 
moment est bien choisi pour un tel débat : je viens juste de revenir de Francfort où se tenait 
une réunion de politique monétaire du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE. Comme d’autres 
banques centrales, nous poursuivons à présent une stratégie de normalisation progressive 
dans un monde incertain. Permettez-moi de commencer en vous présentant quelques 
éléments clés concernant notre stratégie domestique pour la zone euro, avant d’évoquer 
les défis auxquels nous sommes confrontés collectivement au niveau mondial.   
** 
1. La politique monétaire dans la zone euro : où allons-nous ? 
La zone euro connaît actuellement une expansion économique généralisée. Le deuxième 
trimestre 2018 a été le 21ème trimestre consécutif de croissance économique. 9,2 millions 
d’emplois ont été créés depuis 2013 et le taux de chômage est revenu de 12,1 % à 8,1 %, 
même si ce chiffre demeure encore trop élevé. L’écart de production (output gap) était 
probablement comblé à la fin de l’année dernière. Des données d’enquête récentes sur les 
perspectives de croissance font état d’un léger affaiblissement, qui est toutefois moins 
marqué pour la France.  
Mais nos perspectives d’inflation continuent de se raffermir. On observe des signes 
croissants de tensions sur le marché du travail et la croissance des salaires nominaux 
s’accélère : la courbe de Philips est de nouveau à l’œuvre, bien qu’un peu plus tardivement 
que prévu, et cela devrait se transmettre à l’inflation sous-jacente qui accuse un retard en 
raison des effets temporaires de l’appréciation des termes de l’échange et du recul des 
marges bénéficiaires des entreprises. Au Conseil des gouverneurs, nous sommes donc de 
plus en plus confiants dans un retour durable de l’inflation vers notre objectif, notre prévision 
de 1,7 % chaque année en 2018, 2019 et 2020 justifiant nos décisions prises à l’unanimité. 
À côté de ces éléments positifs, il existe toutefois des incertitudes croissantes : le 
protectionnisme – j’y reviendrai ; l’augmentation des prix du pétrole ; les choix de politique 
économique aux États-Unis – une normalisation justifiée de la politique monétaire assortie 
d’une relance budgétaire moins justifiée – qui mettent en difficulté de nombreux pays 
émergents ; et des valorisations sur les marchés boursiers qui, après la dernière correction, 
peuvent apparaître plus conformes aux fondamentaux économiques et à la rentabilité des 
entreprises, mais demeurent volatiles en raison également des risques géopolitiques. En 
Europe, la politique budgétaire italienne est suivie de près par les investisseurs. Et enfin il y 
a le Brexit, même si son impact macroéconomique direct sur la zone euro devrait être faible.

Comment, en tant que banquiers centraux de la zone euro, réagir face à cet environnement 
économique ? En combinant deux objectifs apparemment contradictoires, la clarté et la 
flexibilité. 
S’agissant de la clarté, notre premier devoir, en tant que décideurs, est de fournir des 
repères permettant de guider les acteurs économiques et les marchés financiers dans un 
brouillard d’incertitudes de plus en plus dense. Pour que nos indications soient fiables, nous 
devons être aussi clairs, crédibles et cohérents que possible. Nous ne pouvons pas être 
clairs comme un horaire des trains, mais plutôt comme le capitaine qui fixe le cap et s’adapte 
au vent et aux vagues.  
La séquence des étapes vers la normalisation de notre politique monétaire est donc très 
prévisible :  
­ premièrement, nous avons réduit de moitié nos achats d’actifs ce mois-ci, les ramenant à 
15 milliards d’euros et nous y mettrons probablement fin en décembre ; 
­ deuxièmement, nous définissons un axe de direction avec notre forward guidance à long 
terme : nous maintiendrons les taux d’intérêt à leurs niveaux actuels au moins jusqu’à 
l’été 2019 ;  
­ et troisièmement, nous conserverons notre stock d’actifs aussi longtemps que nécessaire 
pour maintenir des conditions de liquidité favorables et un degré élevé de soutien 
monétaire. Permettez-moi d’insister ; la fin des achats nets d’actifs ne sera pas la fin de 
notre stimulus monétaire, loin de là. 
De plus, cette séquence ne dépend pas des incertitudes budgétaires qui peuvent apparaître 
dans certains États membres. La position du Conseil des gouverneurs est claire sur le fait 
qu’il n’y a pas de prépondérance budgétaire (fiscal dominance) dans la zone euro et 
qu’aucune politique budgétaire nationale n’influence notre politique monétaire commune. 
La cohérence dont nous avons fait preuve jusqu’à présent fonde aussi notre crédibilité pour 
l’avenir. Depuis mars 2016, nous avons pris des décisions environ tous les neuf mois sur 
l’évolution de nos achats nets. Nous avons à chaque fois donné de la visibilité sur les douze 
mois suivants ; et nous avons toujours tenu les calendriers indicatifs prévisionnels que nous 
avions donnés, sans prolongation des délais.  
J’en viens à présent à la flexibilité. Notre séquence est claire mais les détails de sa mise en 
œuvre sont flexibles et dépendants de la situation. Nous avons inclus plusieurs options, qu’il 
s’agisse de la date précise du premier relèvement des taux d’intérêt directeurs et de leur 
trajectoire par la suite, ou bien du rythme de nos réinvestissements. La trajectoire future de 
nos taux d’intérêt fait l’objet de maintes spéculations, mais à ce stade, j’estime qu’il n’y aurait 
 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
aucun intérêt à troquer notre flexibilité de demain contre plus de clarté aujourd’hui. Au-delà, 
comme Mario Draghi l’a mentionné aujourd’hui, la question des TLTRO devra être examinée. 
Face à l’incertitude, il est souvent fait référence au célèbre « principe de conservatisme » de 
Brainardi (réinterprété par Alan Blinderii). Il ne s’agit pas, comme on l’entend parfois, d’un 
avertissement général appelant à agir prudemment quand le monde est incertain. Le 
« principe de conservatisme » de Brainard dit seulement que vous devez agir prudemment si 
vous n’êtes pas certain de l’effet de votre instrument de politique monétaire sur votre objectif. 
Mais nous devons aller au-delà d’une vision statique du principe de Brainard (se concentrant 
sur une seule petite étape) : une vision dynamique consisterait à inclure la dimension 
temporelle et à déterminer comment gérer et communiquer sur une séquence d’étapes 
graduelles.  
 
2. Comment pouvons-nous répondre collectivement aux tensions internationales ? 
Les tensions s’intensifient dans l’environnement international, à commencer par le 
protectionnisme. Outre le choc de politique commerciale direct résultant d’une hausse des 
droits de douane, au moins deux facteurs peuvent accentuer la baisse du PIB mondial : un 
recul de la demande d’investissement dû à la baisse de la confiance des chefs d’entreprise 
liée à l’incertitude, et une hausse du coût de financement du capital en raison d’une 
accentuation du risque réel ou perçu lié à l’emprunteur. Selon les estimations réalisées par la 
Banque de France à partir de modèles, l’impact négatif sur le PIB d’une hausse des droits de 
douane est 2 à 3 fois plus important lorsque l’on prend en compte ces canaux indirects. De 
plus, cette accentuation de l’incertitude peut produire des effets négatifs très rapidement, 
avant même que la mise en œuvre des mesures protectionnistes ne soit effective. Cela dit, 
le protectionnisme constitue avant tout un choc d’offre négatif, assorti d’effets 
stagflationnistes. En tant que tels, les effets négatifs du protectionnisme ne peuvent et ne 
doivent pas être pris en compte par la politique monétaire.  
En dépit des menaces protectionnistes, l’économie mondiale poursuit sa forte expansion, à 
un rythme de 3,7 % cette année. Lors de nos dernières réunions au FMI, nous avons très 
souvent utilisé le joli mot français de « plateau » pour décrire la croissance mondiale. Mais 
ce « plateau » n’est pas uniforme : la forte accélération aux États-Unis, même si elle est 
temporaire et fragile, est contrebalancée par une modération ailleurs. En résumé, nous 
sommes en train de passer d’une croissance synchronisée à une divergence économique. 
Par conséquent, certains pays pourraient souffrir de la hausse actuelle des taux d’intérêt aux 
États-Unis. En 2013, dans un célèbre article, Hélène Reyiii affirmait que des taux de change 
flottants n’étaient pas suffisants pour que les pays ayant un compte de capital ouvert soient 
 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
indépendants vis-à-vis de la politique monétaire américaine. Si le trilemme est en fait un 
dilemme, alors les pays devront choisir entre indépendance monétaire et fermeture de leur 
compte de capital. 
Je voudrais remettre en question le caractère universel et absolu de ce dilemme. Par 
exemple, je suis certain que la zone euro est capable de fixer son propre cap. Notre 
programme d’achats d’actifs a contribué à un écart de rendement (spread) de plus de 
250 points de base sur les emprunts publics à 10 ans aux États-Unis et en Allemagne. De 
même, l’écart entre les taux directeurs aux États-Unis et dans la zone euro est le plus 
important observé depuis 2009. Plus techniquement, une règle de Taylor estimée pour la 
zone euro intégrant la politique monétaire américaine comme facteur explicatif ne fait 
apparaître qu’une très faible corrélation entre les deux politiques monétaires. 
De plus, les pays semblent se répartir le long d’un continuum, allant des pays qui affichent 
une indépendance totale à ceux dont le taux de change est ancré au dollar. Ils ne sont donc 
pas tenus d’occuper l’une ou l’autre des positions extrêmes mais peuvent choisir une 
position intermédiaire. Par exemple, imposer des restrictions temporaires aux flux de 
capitaux transfrontières pourrait permettre à un pays de retrouver une indépendance partielle 
mais non totale de sa politique monétaire. 
Mais que peuvent faire de plus les banquiers centraux pour remédier aux tensions créées 
par cette divergence économique ? En d’autres termes, comment concilier un autre couple 
tout aussi paradoxal, à savoir indépendance et coopération ? J’estime que nous pouvons 
et devons agir pour renforcer la coopération entre banques centrales, en nous appuyant sur 
quatre éléments fondamentaux : 
­ la prévisibilité mutuelle dans l’élaboration de nos politiques monétaires. Nous nous 
rapprocherons le plus d’une solution de coopération si nous évitons les grosses surprises 
entre décideurs. Alors que le multilatéralisme commercial est en risque, le 
multilatéralisme monétaire et financier tient bon, fort heureusement. Cela signifie 
notamment de continuer à favoriser le dialogue et l’échange d’informations entre 
banques centrales et d’être très clair sur nos choix de régime de politique monétaire. 
Nous devons apprécier comme elle le mérite la « grande convergence » de nos objectifs 
au cours des quinze dernières années. Dans les principales économies avancées, nous 
avons maintenant une politique de ciblage de l’inflation domestique autour d’un objectif 
de 2 % à moyen terme. 
­ nous refusons toute guerre des monnaies, comme nous l’avons clairement affirmé dans 
le communiqué unanime issu de la réunion qui s’est tenue ce mois-ci à Bali : « Nous 
n’établirons pas de cible de taux de change à des fins de concurrence ».  
 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
­ s’agissant des mesures de gestion des flux de capitaux, nous devons apporter notre 
contribution aux réflexions engagées au sein des organisations internationales 
compétentes et donner la priorité aux solutions pratiques et pragmatiques – de type FMI 
– plutôt qu’à une pureté toute dogmatique.  
­ enfin, comme le Groupe des personnalités éminentes du G20 (G20 Eminent Persons 
Group - EPG) présidé par Tharman Shanmugaratnam, l’a très justement souligné dans 
son récent rapport, nous devons mettre en place un filet de sécurité financier mondial 
avant la prochaine crise et coordonner ses différentes strates. Cela devrait inclure « une 
facilité permanente de liquidité du FMI ». Le filet de sécurité financier mondial constitue la 
meilleure garantie que nous puissions avoir contre les risques engendrés par la 
divergence économique, et son coût est limité. 
** 
Je voudrais conclure par une citation de Voltaire, qui, en 1770, écrivait: « le doute n’est pas 
un état bien agréable, mais l’assurance est un état ridicule »iv. Dans ces temps de doute, en 
tant que banquiers centraux, nous devons être prévisibles sans être pré-engagés – ou, 
comme le dirait Voltaire, nous devons donner de la clarté sans prétendre à la certitude. C’est 
précisément l’objectif du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE : nous nous engageons à 
donner le plus de clarté possible ; de la clarté et non de la certitude, qui n’est ni possible ni 
souhaitable. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous pour clôturer cette dixième conférence 
internationale de l’assurance, sous l’égide du Président Bernard Spitz. On ne 
le dit pas assez souvent : le secteur financier est une force de l’économie 
française ; et on devrait le souligner davantage : au sein de ce secteur 
financier, les assureurs sont un atout essentiel pour notre financement. Ce 
sera mon premier point. J’en viendrai ensuite aux évolutions règlementaires : 
pour saluer les progrès accomplis depuis un an, et relever quelques défis 
européens qui nous attendent ensemble. J’en viendrai enfin aux « limites de 
l’assurabilité » : votre thème d’aujourd’hui aussi vieux que votre métier, depuis 
l’Antiquité et la protection contre la « grosse aventure », et le premier contrat à 
Gênes en 1347. Mais il se pose avec une acuité nouvelle, face aux nouveaux 
risques, notamment le changement climatique.   
** 
I. Les assureurs, des acteurs essentiels du financement de l’économie 
L’ACPR a publié il y a dix jours son rapport statistique annuel qui confirme la 
solidité du secteur français des assurances. C’est une mine de données, qui 
sont à votre honneur : allez y piocher. Le taux moyen de couverture du capital 
de solvabilité requis (SCR) du marché français est passé de 222 % en 2016 à 
238 % en 2017. Au premier trimestre 2018, le marché français de l’assurance 
est par ailleurs devenu le premier marché européen, devant l’Allemagne et le 
Royaume-Uni, qu’il s’agisse des plus de 35 milliards d’euros de primes émises 
en affaires directes non-vie ou des plus de 2100 milliards d’euros de 
provisions techniques. Il s’impose également par sa capacité d’investissement, 
puisqu’avec un total d’actifs de 2700 milliards d’euros en septembre 2018, le 
secteur assurantiel français est de très loin le premier investisseur 
institutionnel en Europe, représentant plus du tiers du total des actifs des 
assureurs de la zone euro, alors que la France représente 21 % du PIB de 
celle-ci. 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
Les assureurs sont bien un atout de la France, et leur rôle – primordial – dans 
le financement de l’économie peut et doit encore grandir. Les fonds propres 
des entreprises sont la clé de l’innovation et donc du dynamisme de 
l’économie ; mais ils ne représentaient que 77 % du PIB en zone euro mi-2018 
– et 76 % en France –, contre 124 % aux États-Unis.  
 
II. Saisir les opportunités règlementaires 
Je relève d’abord que la mise en place du PFU (Prélèvement forfaitaire 
unique), au 1er janvier dernier, n’a en rien pénalisé l’assurance-vie 
contrairement à certaines craintes de votre part. Et je me réjouis plus encore 
que le projet de loi Pacte, qui vient d’être adopté en première lecture par 
l’Assemblée Nationale, vise à encourager l’investissement en actions et les 
investissements de long terme. Notre discussion en amont y a contribué : pour 
développer – enfin – Eurocroissance, avec un objectif ambitieux de 20 
milliards d’euros d’encours auquel vous n’êtes pas étrangers, contre les 2 
milliards actuels, et des leviers que le législateur a élargis en conséquence. 
Maintenant, il faut « délivrer » : nous sommes tous en droit d’attendre un 
nouveau départ, un « reset » d’Eurocroissance, avec imagination et 
mobilisation commerciales de votre part, dès lors que le cadre de simplification 
sera achevé. Sur l’épargne-retraite, le débat a été vif sur la sortie en rente ou 
en capital. Je me réjouis avec vous que la possibilité de sortie en rente ait été 
préservée, partout, et surtout que le principe d’un produit destiné à la rente l’ait 
également été : non pas pour défendre une profession contre une autre, mais 
parce qu’un revenu viager dans la durée correspond mieux à un produit de 
retraite, et parce que cette durée même doit permettre plus de placements en 
actions. Mais là aussi, à vous de jouer : que l’épargne-retraite se développe 
enfin en France, et que votre gestion actif-passif intègre mieux ces durations 
allongées. Les besoins sont immenses et l’objectif de porter de 200 à 300 
milliards les encours  de produits d’épargne retraite est très certainement à 
notre portée. Il est à souligner s’agissant de ces produits de retraite qu’il est 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
essentiel de veiller à la bonne information de l’assuré surtout, comme pour 
tous les produits en unités de compte, lorsque le capital investi n’est pas 
garanti.  
Au plan européen, la prochaine revue de Solvabilité 2 doit s’accompagner 
d’un bilan complet et sans tabou du dispositif entré en vigueur il y a désormais 
3 ans. Bien sûr, avec Solvabilité 2, les assureurs ont nettement amélioré la 
gestion de leurs risques et de leur capital, et le marché de l’assurance est 
aujourd’hui plus résilient et mieux armé pour faire face aux crises financières. 
Ce constat positif ne doit pourtant pas occulter les questions que nous nous 
posons légitimement après un changement aussi radical : en particulier celle 
de l’impact sur l’investissement en actions et le financement de l’économie 
européenne, celle de la volatilité et celle de la complexité. Qui dit « revue » en 
2020, dit par définition que le statu quo ne doit pas être une option. Alors que 
les travaux préparatoires débutent, je souhaite que tous les sujets, même les 
plus difficiles, soient abordés et traités. J’invite les assureurs à participer 
activement aux consultations et, de mon côté, je peux vous assurer que 
l’ACPR pèsera de tout son poids dans les discussions à venir. À cet égard, 
nous soutenons naturellement les efforts du Trésor français et des assureurs 
en vue d’obtenir, dès la revue 2018, un meilleur traitement prudentiel des 
actions détenues à long terme. 
J’ajouterai un point d’actualité : il est, selon moi, indispensable que les 
superviseurs appliquent tous les exigences prudentielles avec la même 
rigueur. Les défaillances en série d’assureurs travaillant en LPS sur le marché 
français – notamment en assurance construction – nous rappellent cet 
impératif. L’ACPR est bien évidemment mobilisée pour la gestion de cette 
crise qui affecte des dizaines de milliers d’assurés français. Mais il faut aussi 
que la nécessaire convergence des pratiques de contrôle devienne 
rapidement une réalité. Je sais, cher Gabriel Bernardino, que vous en avez fait 
une des priorités de L’EIOPA. 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Enfin, je vais le dire sans détours : il n’est pas raisonnable d’appliquer le 
nouveau référentiel comptable IFRS17 maintenant, au vu de l’état actuel 
des discussions.  Quelles que soient par ailleurs les complexités de la 
gouvernance européenne de ces normes, il y a un problème évident de 
calendrier et l’IASB semble heureusement rouvrir les discussions en ce sens. 
La mise en œuvre des normes IFRS17, qui sera coûteuse et complexe, fait 
suite à celle de Solvabilité 2 qui a beaucoup mobilisé les assureurs. Au-delà 
du calendrier, il y a de sérieux problèmes de fond. Nous souhaitons qu’un 
accord sur la détermination des groupes de contrats déficitaires soit trouvé. En 
l’état, le projet est  inapplicable. Nous voulons également que les discussions 
sur le traitement des couvertures de réassurance détenues aboutissent. À ce 
stade, une trop large place est laissée à l’interprétation dans la norme, ce qui 
pourrait nuire à la comparabilité et à une application cohérente entre pays. 
 
III. Faire face à l’émergence de nouveaux risques 
J’en viens maintenant aux nouveaux risques qui sont, pour le secteur de 
l’assurance, autant de défis à relever. J’en évoquerai trois, par horizon de 
temps croissant : le Brexit, la cyber-sécurité et le risque climatique.  
À court terme, le Brexit est malheureusement ce qui nous occupe le plus. 
L’ACPR travaille activement pour assurer la transition, mais il est temps 
désormais que les assureurs mettent réellement en œuvre leurs plans de 
contingence. Cela suppose d’échanger avec les autorités de supervision – du 
côté britannique et du côté européen. Cela implique aussi de nouveaux 
agréments, des transferts de portefeuilles et la relocalisation de sociétés 
européennes ou l’établissement de succursales de pays tiers. Même si nous 
ne la souhaitons pas, nous devons impérativement être prêts à faire face à 
une situation de « no deal ». À cet égard, des dispositions européennes sont 
préférables pour régler de façon uniforme toutes les questions pertinentes ; 
mais si nécessaire et en complément, le projet de loi d’habilitation présenté en 
Conseil des ministres le 3 octobre nous permettra de prendre les dispositions 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
juridiques françaises pour gérer, vis-à-vis des personnes assurées en France,  
des situations où des entreprises britanniques n’auraient pas préalablement 
transféré leurs portefeuilles de contrats. Je note par ailleurs que les travaux 
communs menés par la BCE et la Banque d’Angleterre sur l’évaluation des 
risques financiers ont examiné notamment les contrats d’assurance et que les 
risques nous apparaissent ici gérables, dès lors qu’on garantit  bien la 
protection des assurés.  
À moyen terme, et dans un contexte de révolution numérique, la cyber-
sécurité représente une préoccupation grandissante qui touche l’ensemble 
des entreprises. Les assureurs sont bien sûr parmi les premiers concernés car 
ils détiennent des données sensibles. À partir de votre propre expérience 
contre les cyber-risques, il est très souhaitable que vous développiez votre 
offre de cyber-assurance.  
Je terminerai avec le risque climatique, qui s’inscrit dans un horizon de 
temps plus long mais qui nécessite cependant des actions concrètes dès à 
présent. Comme vos échanges l’ont montré aujourd’hui, une réforme du 
régime d’assurance des catastrophes naturelles est nécessaire et je sais 
qu’elle devrait voir le jour en 2019. Mais c’est aussi un domaine d’investigation 
très important pour les superviseurs car la stabilité climatique est à long terme 
l’un des déterminants de la stabilité financière. L’ACPR a publié en juin 2018 
une étude qui montre qu’entre 10 et 20 % de l’ensemble des titres détenus par 
les assureurs français seraient exposés au risque de transition vers une 
économie à bas carbone. La Banque de France et l’ACPR ont créé et animent 
activement le Réseau des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le 
verdissement du système financier (NGFS), lancé à Paris en décembre 
dernier. Le NGFS, parti avec 8 superviseurs pionniers, compte désormais 19 
membres et 5 observateurs, dont le Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF). Nous 
travaillons avec énergie sur deux sujets où les assureurs sont en avance : la 
« disclosure » des risques climatiques actuels, et la projection de stress-tests 
dynamiques sur les risques futurs. Le rapport concluant la première année des 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
travaux et incluant des recommandations sera présenté lors d’une conférence 
à Paris le 17 avril prochain. 
** 
Il m’est arrivé de qualifier la finance verte de « nouvelle frontière pour le XXIe 
siècle ». Aujourd’hui, vous parlez de « repousser les limites de l’assurabilité ». 
Ces images de pionnier disent en tout cas votre esprit d’entreprise et 
d’innovation. Notre monde de 2018, porteur incontestablement de risques 
croissants, en a besoin plus que jamais. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

« Quelle place pour les crypto-actifs  
dans notre système de paiement ? » 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
 
Bonjour Mesdames et Messieurs,  
 
L’explosion et la volatilité du cours du bitcoin, valorisé moins d’un an après son lancement, 
en octobre 2009, à 0,001 $, et 6 500 $ aujourd’hui, après un pic à 19 500 $ en décembre 
2017, ont fortement contribué à la médiatisation du développement d’objets monétaires et 
financiers nouveaux, les crypto-actifs, dont le Bitcoin n’est que la figure la plus connue 
(on recense aujourd’hui plus de 2000 d’entre eux dans le monde).  
 
Ces actifs, initialement conçus comme des instruments d’échange pour l’internet, ont 
progressivement pris pied dans l’économie réelle, avec le développement de services 
permettant leur achat ou leur vente contre la monnaie émise par la banque centrale ou les 
banques, leur conservation, leur utilisation comme instrument d’échange contre d’autres 
actifs ou encore plus récemment comme instrument de placement et de financement, avec 
l’apparition des “ Initial Coin Offering”, les ICOs. 
 
Émis et stockés sous forme électronique, ces actifs présentent des spécificités qu’un 
humoriste américain, John Oliver, a malicieusement résumées dans sa chronique 
hebdomadaire Last Week Tonight du 11 mars 2018, en ces termes : “ les crypto actifs 
combinent tout ce que nous ne comprenons pas à la monnaie avec tout ce que nous ne 
comprenons pas à l’informatique”. Ce diagnostic est dû à une triple originalité, sur un 
plan financier, monétaire et technique, des crypto-actifs, par rapport aux monnaies et 
moyens de paiement émis par les institutions financières et les banques centrales, qui 
constituent en Europe le socle de notre système monétaire : ils n’ont pas d’émetteur dont les 
actifs jouent le rôle de gage de valeur, ils n’ont pas de taux change fixe garanti avec la 
monnaie émise par la Banque centrale qui constitue l’ancre de notre système de paiement 
car elle est la seule à avoir cours légal, c’est-à-dire à devoir être acceptée par tous, et ils 
s’appuient pour leur circulation sur un système décentralisé et distribué de calculs 
cryptographiques et d’enregistrement, appelé blockchain.   
 
Ces originalités sont largement à l’origine de vues assez différentes que l’on peut entendre 
sur les perspectives de développement des crypto-actifs, sachant qu’ils occupent pour 
l’instant une place marginale auprès des agents économiques et dans l’économie mondiale 
(à son maximum en janvier 2018, l’encours total des crypto-actifs a atteint 330 milliards 
d’euros ; en comparaison, l’agrégat de monnaie M1 de la zone euro représente 7 500 
milliards d’euros). Pour les uns, les crypto-actifs feraient partie des innovations dites 
“disruptives” qui vont radicalement et positivement affecter le fonctionnement de notre 
3 
 
système monétaire et financier. Pour les autres, nous serions en présence d’innovations 
dont le marché reste à trouver et qui tomberaient, au mieux, pour reprendre une expression 
utilisée par The Economist dans le dossier qu’il a consacré au sujet dans son numéro de 
début septembre 2018, dans la catégorie“ des solutions à la recherche d’un problème” 
(“crypto currencies look like a solution in search of a problem”). 
 
Face à cet avenir pour le moins incertain, je voudrais, de mon point de vue de banquier 
central et de superviseur, attentif aux innovations susceptibles d’affecter l’efficacité et la 
sécurité de notre système de paiement, car c’est un déterminant très important de la stabilité 
de notre système monétaire et financier, partager avec vous quelques considérations et 
réflexions d’une part sur la place des crypto-actifs dans la mutation qui est engagée de 
nos modes  de paiement, et d’autre part sur les défis qu’ils posent en terme de 
supervision.  
 
I. J’aimerais d’abord replacer le développement des crypto-actifs dans une 
perspective plus large, celle de la mutation des moyens de paiement.  
L’accompagnement de cette mutation est au cœur de nos activités à la Banque de 
France, compte tenu de la mission que nous a donné le législateur d’une part de nous 
assurer de la sécurité des moyens de paiement scripturaux,  et d’autre part de veiller à la 
qualité de la circulation des billets qui sont les seuls moyens de paiements à avoir cours 
légal, ce qui requiert que nous nous assurions que les billets demeurent un moyen de 
paiement sûr et facilement accessible pour tous ceux qui souhaitent l’utiliser, y compris et 
en particulier les populations fragiles. Cette double mission nous a conduits à faire 
reposer nos actions sur un principe de neutralité et de libre choix qui implique pour nous 
de ne pas favoriser un moyen de paiement par rapport à un autre et de ne pas chercher à 
influencer les comportements et les préférences du public.  
 
1) Dans le paysage des moyens de paiement, nous assistons en effet actuellement à un 
double mouvement de recul des paiements fiduciaires et de transformation des 
paiements scripturaux, en lien avec les évolutions comportementales et les 
innovations technologiques.  
 
Ainsi, les changements observés dans les modes de consommation -comme la progression 
du commerce en ligne- contribuent à un repli continu du recours aux espèces dans les 
transactions au profit des moyens de paiement électroniques. D’un point de vue 
statistique, on constate d’ailleurs que le volume de billets remontant du public vers les 
professionnels du traitement des espèces a diminué de plus de 10% entre 2012 et 2017. Ce 
4 
 
repli doit toutefois être relativisé, car le billet continue de dominer les usages transactionnels 
de proximité, en particulier sur les faibles montants, comme en témoignent les études 
récentes conduites par l’Eurosystème : les billets sont toujours le principal instrument de 
paiement en Europe et France en nombre de transactions (79 % des transactions en zone 
euro et 68 % en France – en valeur respectivement 54 et 28 %).  
 
Parallèlement, on assiste à une montée en puissance des paiements électroniques, qui 
non seulement croissent mais aussi évoluent fortement dans 4 directions : 
 
<U+F0F0> La Dissémination technologique : le perfectionnement des technologies internet et 
des appareils a permis de multiplier les canaux d’initiation et d’acceptation des 
paiements. Les usages sont aujourd’hui plus diversifiés et plus numériques. Ils ne 
sont plus limités à la carte, on le voit par exemple avec le paiement mobile. 
<U+F0F0> La Dissémination des acteurs : je vise ici l’élargissement du marché des paiements 
à la concurrence des Big Techs et aux enseignes de grande distribution, selon des 
stratégies assez hétérogènes. Le corollaire de ce phénomène, c’est 
l’internationalisation du marché qui soulève des problématiques en matière de 
souveraineté et d’indépendance. C’est par exemple le cas du contrôle des données 
vis-à-vis des GAFA américains ou des BATX chinois. 
<U+F0F0> La Dilution de l’acte de paiement : aujourd’hui l’acte de paiement est moins visible, 
il est noyé dans le processus global de transaction afin de minimiser son impact pour 
le payeur. On constate par exemple cette évolution dans les paiements en ligne, dont 
l’ergonomie est de plus en plus fluide, à l’image des paiements one click. 
<U+F0F0> La Disponibilité du service de paiement : celle-ci se développe sans considération 
de frontières physiques ou temporelle pour répondre aux demandes de clients pour 
des services de paiement instantanés, continus et uniformes, les agents 
économiques étant de plus en plus mobiles. 
  
5 
 
2) le développement des crypto-actifs s’inscrit assez naturellement dans ces 
tendances de fond qui affectent les moyens de paiement,  en associant recherche 
d’anonymat, gestion de paiements de « pair à pair » et sans intermédiaire, et utilisation 
de technologies entièrement liées à internet.  
 
Mais les crypto-actifs s’en distinguent aussi, du fait des spécificités financières 
monétaires et technologiques que j’ai rappelées en introduction à mon propos. Celles-
ci sont clairement porteuses d’opportunités d’améliorations pour les services de paiement 
dans au moins trois directions : 
 
<U+F0B7> Ces opportunités sont d’abord liées à l’utilisation de la technologie blockchain 
sous-jacente, pour améliorer ou compléter des processus existants :  
la technologie blockchain est ainsi d’ores et déjà utilisée par la Banque de France 
pour améliorer des processus de Place. C’est par exemple le cas pour l’attribution 
des Identifiants Créanciers SEPA, nécessaires à l’émission de prélèvements par les 
créanciers, désormais gérée au travers d’une blockchain, appelée MADRE.  
 
<U+F0B7> Les crypto-actifs peuvent également aider à remédier à des inefficacités de 
marché : par exemple dans le domaine des paiements internationaux multidevises, 
dans l’objectif d’améliorer les conditions des transferts internationaux de fonds pour 
les particuliers.  
 
<U+F0B7> Les crypto-actifs peuvent également contribuer à diversifier les méthodes de 
financement de projets : l’exemple type, ce sont les ICOs, qui ont conduit ces deux 
dernières années à des levées de fonds rapides et importantes dans le secteur des 
technologies de réseaux. 
 
3) Les crypto-actifs peuvent-ils pour autant devenir de véritables monnaies 
susceptibles de révolutionner notre système de paiement, et constituer l’innovation 
décisive qui nous conduira vers une « société sans cash » qui est annoncée voire 
souhaitée par certains ? 
 
On peut pour l’instant en douter car il faut d’abord constater que les crypto-actifs qui 
existent aujourd’hui sont très imparfaits. Comme beaucoup de banquiers centraux l’ont 
souligné, ils ne disposent pas aujourd’hui de façon satisfaisante des qualités attendues d’une 
monnaie et ne peuvent donc être considérés comme telle : 
6 
 
<U+F0B7> Premièrement, leur valeur fluctue très fortement, ce qui ne permet pas d’en faire 
des unités de compte. De fait, très peu de prix sont libellés en crypto-actifs, peu de 
grands commerçants physiques ou en ligne acceptant le bitcoin par exemple, même 
s’il existe quelques exceptions [je pense notamment à showroomprivé.com,  
le deuxième site français de déstockage, qui accepte les bitcoins depuis 2014]. 
 
<U+F0B7> Deuxièmement, comme intermédiaires des échanges, les crypto-actifs sont bien 
moins efficaces que la monnaie qui a cours légal, dans la mesure où (i) la 
volatilité de leur cours rend de plus en plus difficile leur utilisation comme moyen de 
paiement, (ii) ils induisent des frais de transactions qui sont démesurés pour de 
simples opérations de détail, et (iii) ils n’offrent aucune garantie de remboursement 
en cas de fraude. 
 
<U+F0B7> Troisièmement, leur absence de valeur intrinsèque ne permet pas non plus d’en 
faire des réserves de valeur qui inspirent confiance.  
 
En outre, les crypto-actifs peuvent être des vecteurs de risques financiers, de risques 
de sécurité et plus particulièrement de cyber attaques, de blanchiment d’argent et de 
financement du terrorisme, qui sont importants pour leurs utilisateurs et donc pour le 
bon fonctionnement de notre système de paiement si les crypto-actifs étaient amenés à 
jouer un rôle majeur dans celui-ci. 
 
II- Dans ce contexte complexe de crypto-actifs en phase d’expérimentation technique 
et économique, porteuse d’opportunités mais aussi de risques significatifs pour notre 
système de paiement, faut-il et comment envisager leur encadrement règlementaire et 
leur supervision ? 
 
1) les pouvoirs publics peuvent adopter différentes postures. La première serait 
d’ignorer le phénomène. Mais même si les volumes en jeu restent limités et ne suscitent pas 
de risque en termes de stabilité financière, les risques identifiés précédemment doivent être 
traités. La seconde serait d’interdire purement et simplement les crypto-actifs, au titre de ces 
mêmes risques. Plusieurs États ont déjà choisi cette option, comme la Chine (2013) et la 
Russie (2017). La troisième possibilité, et c’est la voie qui a jusqu’à présent été 
privilégiée en Europe et en France face aux innovations susceptibles d’affecter le 
marché des services de paiement, est celle d’une régulation adaptée qui doit 
permettre de concilier deux impératifs : 
 
7 
 
<U+F0F0> Premièrement, remédier aux différents risques que j’ai cités, en vue notamment 
d’assurer un niveau de protection adéquat pour les parties prenantes, qu’il s’agisse 
des investisseurs ou des consommateurs. 
<U+F0F0> Deuxièmement, préserver le potentiel d’innovation technologique offert par les crypto-
actifs. 
 
Ces deux impératifs sont complémentaires. L’adoption d’un cadre sécurisant pour les 
acteurs de l’économie réelle doit permettre de renforcer leur confiance dans les 
mécanismes associés aux crypto-actifs, et donc d’en favoriser le développement.  
 
2)  Dès lors que l’on opte pour un encadrement, quel contenu concret lui donner ? 
C’est précisément l’objet des débats actuellement en cours dans le cadre du projet 
de loi PACTE. En matière de crypto-actifs, le projet de loi PACTE repose sur deux piliers. 
Le premier concerne la question très spécifique des ICOs, pour lequel est envisagé un 
régime de labélisation optionnelle. Cela signifie qu’en vue d’une ICO, une entreprise peut 
demander à labelliser celle-ci auprès de l’AMF. Ce label, à caractère facultatif, permettra 
de crédibiliser l’ICO et de rassurer les acheteurs de jetons quant au sérieux du projet et 
du montage de financement associé. 
 
Le second pilier concerne les prestataires de services en crypto-actifs. Il s’agit 
essentiellement des plateformes d’échange d’actifs numériques contre monnaie légale, et 
des fournisseurs de solutions de conservation d’actifs numériques. Pour répondre aux 
obligations de lutte contre le blanchiment, ces plateformes doivent obligatoirement 
s’enregistrer. Mais pour répondre aux risques relatifs à la sécurité, à l’intégrité du marché et 
donc à la manipulation des cours, une labellisation -optionnelle et à la demande des 
prestataires- pourra être accordée par l’AMF après une enquête plus approfondie, pour offrir 
une sécurité du service aux utilisateurs. La régulation des plateformes d’échange d’actifs 
numériques contre monnaie légale, en France comme dans les autres pays, est un enjeu 
clef pour des raisons évidentes, car c’est là que se fait la connexion entre la sphère virtuelle 
et la sphère réelle, et donc là où se diffuse  le risque de la sphère virtuelle vers la sphère 
réelle.  
 
Comme vous l’avez surement noté, les régimes d’agrément et de labellisation mentionnés 
dans le projet de loi PACTE sont surtout des régimes optionnels, et donc facultatifs. Il y a 
toutefois une exception à ce régime d’optionalité : il s’agit des dispositifs anti-blanchiment et 
anti-financement du terrorisme. Le régulateur européen a résolument choisi de ne faire 
aucun compromis sur ce sujet. Ainsi la 5
ème
 directive européenne anti-blanchiment assujettit 
8 
 
tous les acteurs manipulant des actifs numériques aux dispositions applicables en matière 
de lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme. Cela s’inscrit dans la droite 
ligne, depuis 2014, du régime applicable en France qui dispose que l’échange de crypto-
actifs en Euros requiert un agrément de prestataire de service de paiement, à caractère 
obligatoire, et donc l’assujettissement aux normes LCB-FT. 
 
Pour tenir compte de la phase expérimentale dans laquelle se situent les crypto-actifs 
et des deux impératifs de préservation de la sécurité des paiements et de l’innovation 
dans ce domaine, une alternative possible  à l’approche optionnelle actuellement 
privilégiée dans le projet de loi PACTE est le maintien d’une approche proportionnelle, 
sur laquelle a été fondée jusqu’à présent la réglementation européenne en matière de 
services de paiement, et qui consiste à fixer un cadre obligatoire mais à en faire varier les 
exigences selon la nature, la phase de développement, et les risques des services 
concernés. Une telle approche a été mise en œuvre dans le cadre de la deuxième directive 
sur les services de paiement, la DSP2, pour encadrer le développement sur le marché des 
agrégateurs et des initiateurs de paiement.   
 
En conclusion,  il apparait donc difficile d’anticiper quel rôle pourront jouer ces 
nouveaux objets monétaires et financiers que sont les crypto-actifs dans le système de 
paiement de demain, d’autant que leurs caractéristiques et leurs spécificités sont 
susceptibles de fortement évoluer. Dans l’immédiat, il existe d’importantes limites à 
l’utilisation au quotidien dans le monde des paiements de détail, des crypto-actifs et 
leur attractivité dans cette perspective demeure à démontrer, d’autant que l’offre en 
matière de paiement est aujourd’hui abondante, et continue de se moderniser pour 
répondre aux besoins d’instantanéité des échanges, avec par exemple le déploiement des 
solutions de paiement par mobile ou du virement instantané. En revanche, les 
technologies sous-jacentes dont nous avons parlé, et en premier lieu la blockchain, 
ouvrent des perspectives intéressantes en matière d’évolution des grandes 
infrastructures de paiement et de marché. 
 
L’incertitude sur l’avenir des crypto-actifs dans le monde des paiements ne doit pas nous 
dispenser d’encadrer leur développement compte tenu des risques qui accompagnent leur 
développement. L’adoption d’un cadre sécurisant pour les acteurs de l’économie réelle 
doit permettre de renforcer leur confiance dans les mécanismes associés aux crypto-
actifs, et donc d’en favoriser le développement. La nature intrinsèquement numérique 
et globale des crypto-actifs rend néanmoins indispensable une approche 
9 
 
internationale coordonnée afin d’éviter tout effet d’opportunité, car l’expérience montre 
que les acteurs peuvent facilement se relocaliser dans un territoire offrant une législation 
plus souple. Des groupes de travail dédiés ont déjà été mis en place au sein de différentes 
organisations internationales, sous l’égide du G20. Si les discussions en sont parfois encore 
à leur début, l’objectif reste de dégager un cadre et un code de conduite international à 
moyen terme, pour préserver la sécurité de chacun et la stabilité financière, qui est notre 
bien commun à tous. 
 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence Banque de France – TSE 
Paris, 12 novembre 2018 
 
 
Discours d’introduction de Denis Beau 
Premier sous-gouverneur, 
 
« Finance digitale, disruption du marché et stabilité financière » 
  
 
 
 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs 
Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour la dixième conférence commune 
organisée par la Banque de France et la Toulouse School of Economics. Cette année, nous 
avons décidé de mettre en lumière la façon dont les innovations financières digitales 
impactent la robustesse et l’efficience du système financier. 
Il me semble que le moment est bien choisi pour parler de la finance digitale et de son 
impact disruptif, pour au moins deux raisons : 
- 2018 marque le dixième anniversaire de la faillite de Lehman Brothers et de la publication 
du document de Satoshi Nakamoto présentant les principes du Bitcoin ; 
- ces événements ont provoqué des évolutions réglementaires, des développements et des 
innovations sur les marchés, qui devraient contribuer à renforcer et à modifier le rôle et la 
structure de l’intermédiation financière. 
En conséquence, nous observons un ensemble complexe d’interactions, mêlant concurrence 
et coopération, qui se développent entre « anciens » et « nouveaux » acteurs, et qui vont 
probablement coexister à l’avenir dans la sphère de l’intermédiation. 
« Que cela signifie-t-il en termes de stabilité financière ? » et « Comment cette coexistence 
affecte-t-elle l’activité de banque centrale ? », voici deux questions ouvertes à la discussion 
dans le cadre de cette conférence. Mais, pour l’instant, permettez-moi de poursuivre 
rapidement sur deux points. 
 
I. Les promesses de la finance digitale : redéfinir l’intermédiation financière ? 
Premier point : La digitalisation de la finance prospère sur le terreau des technologies de 
pointe. La combinaison de l’analyse des big data, du cloud computing, de l’intelligence 
artificielle et de la technologie blockchain transforme la façon dont les produits financiers 
sont conçus et distribués. Pour ses partisans, cette transformation est la promesse d’une 
meilleure expérience utilisateur, d’un meilleur financement de l’économie et d’une meilleure 
efficience du système financier. 
Au-delà de ces promesses, les technologies de pointe abaissent également les 
barrières à l’entrée du secteur financier pour les entreprises technologiques et 
permettent de scinder les services financiers en une série de fonctions essentielles 
distinctes, telles que l’acheminement des paiements et de la monnaie, la fourniture de 
financements, le partage des risques et la répartition des capitaux.  
 
 
 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
Face à cette nouvelle concurrence, les modèles d’activité des acteurs en place doivent 
être prêts à s’adapter : la fragmentation des services sera un vrai défi pour les modèles 
d’activité construits selon la logique d’une relation client exclusive et complète impliquant 
éventuellement des éléments de subvention croisée ; une mobilité accrue des clients pourrait 
limiter les possibilités de vente croisée ; et la volatilité plus élevée des dépôts pourrait 
déséquilibrer le financement de la transformation des échéances. 
Cela étant, les Fintechs font beaucoup parler, mais l’important, ce sont les BigTechs.  
D’une part, il est clair que les Fintechs ont déjà eu un impact important et positif sur le 
secteur financier en développant de nouvelles solutions et en prouvant que celles-ci 
apportent de la valeur ajoutée. 
Toutefois, dans l’ensemble, avec une capitalisation boursière de 125 milliards de dollars à 
l’échelle mondiale, les start-ups du secteur de la Fintech ont été jusqu’à présent davantage 
un complément pour les acteurs financiers existants, par le biais d’une intégration ou de 
partenariats, que de véritables rivaux pour les acteurs en place.  
D’autre part, la capitalisation boursière des GAFA – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple – est 
25 fois supérieure à celle de l’ensemble des Fintechs. Les BigTechs disposent déjà une 
présence significative dans les services financiers 
1
 ainsi que des avantages concurrentiels 
pour développer encore leurs activités dans ce domaine. 
Outre des ressources financières massives capables d’assurer les investissements requis et 
une agilité digitale indéniable, elles bénéficient d’une forte image de marque, d’une clientèle 
à l’échelle mondiale sur laquelle elles ont constitué des bases de données propriétaires, et 
d’un accès privilégié aux technologies de pointe. 
Dans ce contexte, les BigTechs, plus que les Fintechs, disposent du potentiel 
nécessaire pour redéfinir fondamentalement l’intermédiation financière en allant 
au-delà du modèle de banque universelle pour s’orienter vers une intégration des 
services financiers au sein d’un écosystème universel. 
Cette évolution est déjà bien engagée en Chine. Et elle soulève des questions vraiment 
fondamentales sur lesquelles je vais revenir. 
 
Pour conclure sur mon premier point, les grands conglomérats étant susceptibles de 
bénéficier le plus des forces centripètes des effets de réseau, il est possible que la finance

finance »

digitale ne conduise pas à un système plus décentralisé. Au lieu d’éliminer 
l’intermédiation, la finance digitale, si on lui laisse le champ libre, conduira plus 
probablement à rebattre les cartes entre les acteurs en place, les plus agiles sur le 
plan numérique, et les rivaux ayant la plus grande capacité financière, qui deviendront 
les nouveaux intermédiaires dominants (et éventuellement systémiques). 
 
II. Un défi commun : repenser d’anciens problèmes, en examiner de nouveaux 
Cela m’amène à mon second point. La digitalisation de la finance nous oblige à réexaminer 
d’anciennes questions réglementaires et prudentielles et à nous confronter à de nouveaux 
enjeux. 
Parmi ces anciennes questions, je souhaiterais en évoquer deux. 
Premièrement, la question du périmètre de la réglementation financière. Prenons par 
exemple les ICO et les crypto-actifs : même s’ils n’apportent rien de nouveau en termes de 
types de risques 
2
, le cadre réglementaire existant peut s’avérer inadapté pour relever les 
défis qu’ils posent. La classification des jetons dans des catégories juridiques existantes 
s’avère très difficile et les activités crypto-intermédiaires sur internet facilitent l’arbitrage 
réglementaire. 
Le même problème s’applique au risque de dépendance vis-à-vis d’une tierce partie. À titre 
d’exemple, le marché du cloud computing est fortement concentré et Amazon Web Services 
a su bâtir une position dominante. Les fonctions financières essentielles évoluant et 
basculant vers le cloud, le risque d’un point unique de défaillance apparaîtra mais pour 
l’instant, les fournisseurs de cloud ne sont pas réglementés et demeurent, dans une large 
mesure, hors de portée des superviseurs. 
Deuxièmement, les questions liées à la déontologie. Notre réglementation intègre un 
jugement sur ce qui est acceptable et ce qui ne l’est pas. Les évolutions technologiques 
rendent possible l’utilisation d’informations qui étaient auparavant hors de portée d’un 
intermédiaire financier. Cela pourrait potentiellement permettre une évaluation plus précise 
du risque ou une tarification plus « réactive » des services. Mais ce qui est possible peut ne 
pas être (socialement) acceptable : par exemple, le développement actuel de « notes de 
crédit établies à partir des informations fournies par les réseaux sociaux » soulève des 
préoccupations en termes de vie privée. Dans ce contexte, le régulateur (dans certains cas, 
le législateur) pourrait être obligé de revoir sa position sur les sujets liés à la déontologie. 
                                                          
2
 Par exemple, risque en matière de comportement financier, risque de manipulation des prix, risque en termes 
d’intégrité du marché ou blanchiment d’argent. 
 
 
 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
J’en viens maintenant aux nouveaux risques, non financiers par nature, mais qui sont 
étroitement liés à la digitalisation de la finance. Deux de ces risques, notamment, méritent un 
examen approfondi. 
Premièrement, la question de l’indépendance stratégique des acteurs en place. Si ces 
acteurs dépendent des BigTechs pour une infrastructure essentielle comme le cloud 
computing, s’ils s’appuient sur la même BigTech pour distribuer leurs produits sur leurs 
plateformes et entrer alors en concurrence avec les BigTechs sur certains segments, ils 
s’exposent à la remise en cause de leur indépendance stratégique, comme ce fut le cas pour 
les hôtels et les commerçants. Ce processus de banalisation des acteurs en place peut 
conduire à abaisser les critères d’octroi des crédits pour compenser la pression accrue sur 
les marges et accentuer le besoin de financement en raison d’une moindre capacité de 
fidélisation de la clientèle. 
Deuxièmement, la question des cyber-risques. Avec le développement des 
interconnexions entre les technologies et le système financier, les cyber-risques qui 
constituaient un risque spécifique deviennent une source potentielle de risque systémique. 
Résoudre le type de problèmes que je viens d’exposer constitue un vrai défi tant d’un 
point de vue réglementaire que prudentiel, dans la mesure où cela suppose d’évaluer à la 
fois les risques et les avantages potentiels apportés au système financier et plus largement à 
l’économie - risques et avantages par nature incertains. Cela peut faire émerger un vaste 
éventail de modes d’actions possibles afin de respecter deux impératifs principaux : 
assurer un niveau suffisant de protection pour les participants et préserver les 
avantages potentiels procurés par l’innovation. 
Permettez-moi d’illustrer ce point au travers des crypto-actifs. En raison de l’insuffisance des 
informations, du manque de données et de la nouveauté de ces objets monétaires et 
financiers, quatre options peuvent être envisagées – et ont été étudiées - par les autorités 
pour aborder cette question : la surveillance, la ségrégation, la réglementation et 
l’interdiction.  
Une recherche économique dynamique est nécessaire pour nous aider à répondre à ces 
défis, notamment dans trois domaines principaux. 
 
Le premier a trait au modèle économique et aux implications de la blockchain et des 
crypto-actifs, et constituera le sujet de l’exposé de David Andolfatto et de la table ronde 
finale : quelles implications pour le système financier en général, et pour les banques 
centrales en particulier ? La politique monétaire des banques centrales deviendra-t-elle 
 
 
 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
moins efficace et, si c’est le cas, les monnaies digitales de banque centrale sont-elles un 
moyen d’en rétablir l’efficacité ? 
Le deuxième, qui fait l’objet de plusieurs des travaux de recherche présentés aujourd’hui, a 
trait au financement de l’économie : des modes de financement de l’économie différents et 
innovants (prêts en ligne, Initial Coin Offerings – ICO, autres modèles de notation) 
donnent-ils de meilleurs résultats que l’intermédiation financière traditionnelle sans accroître 
les risques ? Quels rôles les banques en place peuvent-elles jouer si les services financiers 
doivent être orientés sur la base de données ?  
Le troisième, qui n’est pas à l’ordre du jour de cette conférence, mais qui devrait figurer dans 
le programme de recherche, a trait à l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle dans la finance : 
comment évolueraient les marchés financiers si la plupart des intervenants devaient 
s’appuyer sur des techniques d’IA ou d’apprentissage automatique ? Comment la 
réglementation et les pratiques prudentielles devraient-elles s’adapter pour garantir un 
fonctionnement de l’IA conforme à un optimum financier et social ? 
 
Conclusion 
Je voudrais conclure mon intervention en citant Bill Gates lui-même : « Nous surestimons 
toujours le changement qui se produira au cours des deux prochaines années et 
sous-estimons celui qui interviendra dans les dix ans à venir. Ne vous complaisez pas dans 
l’inaction. » 
La Banque de France essaie de suivre ce conseil. Pour ce faire, nous avons adapté notre 
organisation et notre structure de gouvernance avec la création d’un pôle Fintech au sein de 
notre fonction prudentielle (qui a déjà apporté son soutien à plus de 300 Fintechs), la 
nomination d’un directeur de la transformation digitale et le lancement d’un laboratoire (Lab) 
pour encourager l’innovation au sein même de la Banque. Nous expérimentons les nouvelles 
technologies : la Banque de France a été la première banque centrale à réaliser un véritable 
projet reposant sur la DLT qui est dès maintenant totalement opérationnel 
3
 et nous avons 
mené à bien 8 projets d’intelligence artificielle. Nous organisons également des débats entre 
les régulateurs et le secteur bancaire : le groupe de travail le plus récent, sur l’intelligence 
artificielle, présentera ses conclusions d’ici la fin de l’année. Enfin, comme nous le faisons 
avec la présente conférence, nous cherchons à mieux comprendre ces innovations via la 
recherche économique et nous nous efforçons d’être une plateforme dédiée à un débat 
ouvert.

C’est un plaisir d’être à nouveau à Tokyo avec vous, et avec mon collègue et ami, M. le 
gouverneur Kuroda. Cette 22
e
 édition du Forum financier international annuel est consacrée 
à l’Europe dans un monde disruptif. Mais au-delà de la disruption, le monde est également 
de plus en plus incertain, avec des tensions liées au protectionnisme, des prix du pétrole en 
hausse, un dosage controversé des politiques économiques aux États-Unis, des 
valorisations des marchés boursiers qui demeurent volatiles ; mais aussi, au sein même de 
l’Europe, la politique budgétaire italienne et le Brexit. Par conséquent, dans mes remarques 
d’aujourd’hui, je souhaiterais parler plus en détail de ces deux dimensions : les défis et les 
opportunités pour l’Europe, mais également les questions mondiales que nous devons 
aborder collectivement.   
** 
1. Nos défis et nos opportunités en Europe 
Je voudrais tout d’abord parler de la normalisation graduelle de notre politique 
monétaire. L’expansion économique généralisée de la zone euro se poursuit, à un rythme 
cependant plus modéré. En dépit d’un ralentissement au premier semestre de l’année, la 
croissance du PIB devrait encore être supérieure à son potentiel, même si l’écart de 
production (output gap) est comblé. 9,2 millions d’emplois ont été créés depuis 2013 et le 
taux de chômage est revenu de 12,1 % à 8,1 %. Les données d’enquêtes et les données 
solides récentes sur l’activité économique font état d’un léger affaiblissement (la croissance 
du PIB de la zone euro pour le troisième trimestre ressortant à 0,2 % en rythme trimestriel, 
également en raison de facteurs exceptionnels en Allemagne). Ce ralentissement est 
toutefois moins marqué pour la France (hausse de 0,4 % du PIB en rythme trimestriel au 
troisième trimestre). Mais nos perspectives d’inflation se raffermissent. On observe des 
signes croissants de tensions sur le marché du travail et la croissance des salaires nominaux 
s’accélère : la courbe de Philips est de nouveau à l’œuvre, bien qu’un peu plus tardivement 
que prévu. Au Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE, nous sommes donc confiants dans un 
retour durable de l’inflation vers notre objectif. Mais la normalisation de notre politique repose 
toujours sur ce que j’aime appeler un « quatuor » d’instruments non conventionnels :  
- Le rythme de la politique monétaire, ces dernières années, a été largement donné par 
notre instrument des achats nets d’actifs. Mais les achats nets vont très probablement 
prendre fin en décembre. La fin de nos achats nets d’actifs ne sera cependant pas la fin 
de notre stimulus monétaire, loin de là, car les trois autres instruments du « quatuor » 
garderont la cadence ;  
 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
- Notre deuxième instrument est le stock d’actifs acquis que nous allons intégralement 
réinvestir, aussi longtemps que nécessaire, afin de maintenir des conditions de liquidité 
favorables et un degré élevé de soutien monétaire ;  
- Notre troisième instrument, ce sont les taux d’intérêt directeurs. Il s’agit d’un instrument 
conventionnel utilisé de façon non conventionnelle. Dans nos indications les plus 
récentes sur la trajectoire future des taux d’intérêt directeurs (forward guidance), nous 
avons déclaré que nous maintiendrions les taux d’intérêt à leurs niveaux actuels – y 
compris notre taux négatif de la facilité de dépôt – au moins jusqu’à l’été 2019 ; 
- Notre quatrième instrument est la fourniture de liquidité et de crédit aux banques. La 
deuxième série de TLTRO est encore en cours, tout comme la procédure FRFA. De 
telles opérations pourraient à nouveau être envisagées, éventuellement avec des 
modalités différentes, si cela s’avérait nécessaire. 
Donc, notre quatuor va bientôt devenir un trio, mais cela reste une formation musicale 
puissante. La partition, toutefois, va évoluer au fil du temps et nous devons continuer de 
jouer de façon harmonieuse. En séquence : à mon sens, la diminution des réinvestissements 
ne devrait venir qu’après le premier relèvement de taux. Par conséquent, nous ne sommes 
pas obligés de nous précipiter, dès notre réunion de décembre, pour préciser la durée de 
nos réinvestissements. Et ce trio doit également jouer en synergie, je dirais même en 
symphonie. Comme n’importe quel orchestre, nous devons être capables d’adapter le 
rythme de normalisation de notre politique monétaire (allegro ou andante) et son intensité 
aux données économiques. En un mot, nous sommes très clairs sur notre cible – la 
normalisation après les politiques non conventionnelles – et sur notre séquence, mais très 
pragmatiques sur notre chemin.  
Un autre défi, lié dans une certaine mesure au précédent – étant donné que la politique 
monétaire ne peut pas tout faire –, est la poursuite des réformes structurelles dans les 
pays où elles sont nécessaires. À cet égard, la France est sur la bonne voie. Je le souligne 
en tant que banquier central totalement indépendant : le gouvernement français a fait preuve 
d’un engagement ferme à mener des réformes destinées à stimuler l’emploi, la productivité 
et la résilience. Je pourrais citer, entre autres : les « ordonnances Macron » de 2017 qui ont 
donné une plus grande flexibilité au marché du travail ; les réformes fiscales, qui sont venues 
baisser ou réallouer les prélèvements pesant sur le travail et le capital ; ou la récente loi 
« Avenir professionnel », adoptée à l’été 2018, qui a simplifié l’apprentissage et amélioré le 
système de formation professionnelle. Toutes ces réformes seront, je l’espère, renforcées 
par de nouveaux progrès sur le volet des finances publiques ; mais la France est aujourd’hui 
en meilleure position qu’avant.

Troisième défi : le Brexit. C’est une mauvaise nouvelle, d’abord et avant tout pour le 
Royaume-Uni, mais également pour l’Europe, et nous espérons que le projet d’accord 
auquel sont parvenues les équipes de négociation mardi dernier pourra être finalisé. 
Toutefois, le système financier européen fera inévitablement l’objet d’une restructuration. Au 
lieu d’une City unique pour le continent, nous prévoyons plutôt un réseau polycentrique 
intégré de places financières, avec des spécialisations fondées sur les domaines d’expertise. 
Ce sera l’occasion d’améliorer la circulation de l’abondante épargne de la zone euro – plus 
de 400 milliards d’euros d’excédent – en l’orientant vers le financement par émission 
d’actions et l’innovation.  
Paris dispose de tous les atouts pour devenir le « hub marché » de ce nouveau réseau en 
zone euro. Paris abrite l’un des marchés de capitaux les plus développés d’Europe 
continentale, quatre banques d’envergure mondiale, elle est numéro un du secteur de 
l’assurance et de la gestion d’actifs, elle dispose d’un marché obligataire de premier plan, du 
plus grand marché de titres négociables à court terme (NEU-CP) et occupe la première 
place en matière de financement du capital-risque d’Europe continentale. Les autorités 
financières françaises, y compris la Banque de France, œuvrent également de concert pour 
faciliter la diffusion d’innovations financières saines et solides et pour favoriser le 
développement d’une finance durable. La finance verte, en particulier, est l’une de nos 
priorités , et c’est pourquoi, lors du One Planet Summit en décembre dernier, la Banque de 
France a lancé, avec des banques centrales et des superviseurs du monde entier, le Réseau 
pour le verdissement du système financier (NGFS). En outre, de nombreuses banques 
internationales ont décidé de transférer à Paris la majorité de leurs activités de marché, et 
les institutions financières japonaises seront toujours les bienvenues à Paris.  
 
2. Au-delà de l’Europe, nos questions collectives 
Permettez-moi d’aborder à présent les questions mondiales que nous devons résoudre 
ensemble, en commençant par le Japon et la France. J’imagine que nos points de vue sont 
ici très proches. Les tensions s’intensifient dans l’environnement international, à commencer 
par le protectionnisme. Outre le choc de politique commerciale direct résultant d’une 
hausse des droits de douane, au moins deux facteurs peuvent accentuer la baisse du PIB 
mondial : un recul de la demande d’investissement dû à la baisse de la confiance des chefs 
d’entreprise liée à l’incertitude, et une hausse du coût de financement du capital en raison 
d’une accentuation du risque réel ou perçu lié à l’emprunteur. Selon les estimations réalisées 
par la Banque de France à partir de modèles, l’impact négatif sur le PIB d’une hausse des 
droits de douane est 2 à 3 fois plus important lorsque l’on prend en compte ces canaux 
indirects. De plus, cette accentuation de l’incertitude peut produire des effets négatifs très 
 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
rapidement, avant même que la mise en œuvre des mesures protectionnistes ne soit 
effective. Cela dit, le protectionnisme constitue avant tout un choc d’offre négatif assorti 
d’effets stagflationnistes. En tant que tels, les effets négatifs du protectionnisme ne peuvent 
et ne doivent pas être pris en compte par la politique monétaire.  
En dépit des menaces protectionnistes, l’économie mondiale poursuit sa forte expansion, à 
un rythme de 3,7 % cette année. Lors de nos dernières réunions au FMI, nous avons 
souvent utilisé le joli mot français de « plateau » pour décrire la croissance mondiale. Mais 
ce « plateau » n’est pas uniforme : la forte accélération aux États-Unis, même si elle est 
temporaire et fragile, est contrebalancée par une modération ailleurs. En résumé, le défi tient 
au fait que nous sommes en train de passer d’une croissance synchronisée à une 
divergence économique. Par conséquent, certains pays pourraient souffrir de la hausse 
actuelle des taux d’intérêt aux États-Unis.  
Je suis néanmoins certain que la zone euro – tout comme le Japon – est capable de fixer 
son propre cap monétaire. Le « fossé transatlantique », qu’il concerne les taux à long terme 
ou les taux directeurs, n’a jamais été aussi large depuis 2009. Mais si je prends les 
économies émergentes, elles semblent se répartir le long d’un continuum, allant des pays 
qui affichent une indépendance totale à ceux dont le taux de change est ancré au dollar. 
Imposer des restrictions temporaires aux flux de capitaux transfrontières peut, par exemple, 
permettre à un pays de retrouver une indépendance partielle mais non totale de sa politique 
monétaire. 
Mais comment concilier indépendance et coopération ? J’estime que nous pouvons et 
devons agir pour renforcer la coopération entre autorités publiques, en nous appuyant sur au 
moins deux éléments : 
- refuser toute guerre des monnaies, comme nous l’avons clairement affirmé lors de la 
réunion du Comité monétaire et financier international qui s’est tenue à Bali le mois 
dernier. Je cite le communiqué unanime : « [Nous] n’établirons pas de cible de taux de 
change à des fins de concurrence ». Le multilatéralisme commercial est en risque, mais 
le multilatéralisme financier et monétaire tient encore bon. 
- et, comme le Groupe des personnalités éminentes du G20 (G20 Eminent Persons Group 
- EPG) présidé par Tharman Shanmugaratnam, l’a très justement souligné dans son 
récent rapport, nous devons mettre en place un filet de sécurité financier mondial avant 
la prochaine crise et coordonner ses différentes strates. Cela devrait inclure « une facilité 
permanente de liquidité du FMI ». Le filet de sécurité financier mondial constitue la 
meilleure garantie que nous puissions avoir contre les risques engendrés par la 
 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
divergence économique, et son coût est limité. Je sais que le gouverneur Kuroda est lui 
aussi très engagé sur cette question. 
** 
Permettez-moi de conclure en citant un proverbe japonais : « La grenouille au fond de son 
puits ne connaît rien de l’océan » [« I no naka no kaeru taikai-o shirazu »]. En ces temps 
incertains, il serait tentant de se replier sur soi-même mais ce serait précisément ce qu’il ne 
faut pas faire. À la différence de la grenouille, nous devons aspirer à connaître le vaste 
monde et continuer à travailler ensemble avec nos partenaires pour relever tous les défis 
auxquels nous sommes confrontés. Soyez assurés que cela est vrai pour la France et pour 
l’Europe et, à cet égard, je sais que le Japon est un partenaire fiable sur lequel nous 
pouvons compter. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence de l’ACPR 
 Palais Brongniart, 23 novembre 2018 
 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France, 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) 
 
Les conséquences du Brexit pour le secteur financier français et européen 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr).
 
Page 1 sur 4 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis heureux avec Bernard Delas de vous accueillir pour cette nouvelle conférence de 
l’ACPR consacrée ce matin aux conséquences du Brexit pour le secteur financier. Ce sujet 
évolue certes beaucoup avec l’actualité… Je salue l’accord qui a été trouvé la semaine 
dernière entre les négociateurs européens et britanniques et nous espérons tous que celui-ci 
franchira les prochaines étapes jusqu’à sa finalisation. Mais dans un contexte encore 
incertain, la prudence s’impose : même si nous ne la souhaitons pas, nous devons aussi 
nous préparer à faire face à une situation éventuelle de « no deal ». L’ACPR et la Banque de 
France se préparent à ce scénario, pour assurer le bon fonctionnement du système 
financier. Ce sera mon premier temps et c’est pourquoi j’y parlerai au conditionnel. Je veux 
ensuite me projeter au-delà du Brexit : nous pouvons transformer en partie les contraintes 
d’aujourd’hui en opportunités pour demain et construire un « Eurosystème financier » mieux 
intégré.  
** 
I. À court terme, bien gérer les risques du Brexit 
Dans le cadre de leurs missions, l’ACPR et la Banque de France veillent sur deux principaux 
risques liés à la perspective du Brexit : ceux qui pourraient menacer la stabilité financière et 
ceux qui pourraient remettre en cause la protection de la clientèle. Il s’agit d’éviter un « effet 
de falaise » qui serait lié à un No Deal Brexit. Les conséquences économiques seraient 
naturellement beaucoup plus importantes pour le Royaume-Uni que pour le reste de l’Union 
européenne. Mais à ce stade, notre analyse comme celle de la BCE – vous savez qu’il y a 
eu un travail technique approfondi avec la Banque d’Angleterre – ne fait pas ressortir de 
risque majeur pour la stabilité financière. Je veux le dire après M. Draghi : « il faudrait 
vraiment être excessivement mal préparé pour que les risques pour la stabilité financière liés 
à un hard Brexit se matérialisent.»
 i
  La compensation des dérivés de taux mérite cependant 
un traitement particulier car les chambres de compensation britanniques occupent une 
position de quasi-monopole dans ce secteur. En cas de No Deal Brexit et en l’absence de 
mesures particulières, ceci pourrait représenter un risque systémique. Nous soutenons donc 
la solution prévue par la Commission européenne, à savoir – si c’était malheureusement 
nécessaire –la reconnaissance temporaire de l’équivalence du cadre législatif britannique 
dans le cadre d’EMIR 1 et l’autorisation pour les chambres de compensation britanniques de 
continuer de fournir des services de compensation aux institutions financières européennes 
jusqu’à l’entrée en vigueur d’EMIR 2. Mais cette solution devrait clairement rester 
temporaire, sur une durée limitée à une grosse année. Elle devrait aussi être liée à un 
 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
calendrier ferme d’adoption d’EMIR 2. Nous souhaitons maintenant que les institutions 
européennes parviennent à finaliser cette « clause de sécurité » dans les meilleurs délais.   
Notre principal point d’attention aujourd’hui concernerait la protection de la clientèle ayant 
souscrit des contrats auprès d’entreprises britanniques, notamment dans le secteur des 
assurances. C’est bien sûr à l’industrie elle-même de se préparer activement aux 
conséquences de la perte du passeport européen. La plupart des grands acteurs ont pris les 
dispositions nécessaires. L’ACPR a déjà délivré des autorisations à certains d’entre eux et 
elle accompagne aujourd’hui plus d’une cinquantaine d’institutions tous secteurs confondus 
dans leurs démarches de relocalisation. Mais nous maintenons une vigilance particulière 
pour les moyens et les petits acteurs, notamment les entreprises d’investissement de taille 
modeste, ainsi que les établissements de paiement et de monnaie électronique. Une 
enquête de l’ACPR menée en juillet dernier indiquait que seuls 24 % des entreprises 
d’investissement et 22 % des établissements de paiement et de monnaie électronique 
exerçant dans le cadre de la libre prestation de services souhaitaient obtenir un agrément 
d’ici fin 2018. 
Nous devons donc être prêts à gérer des situations où des entreprises britanniques 
n’auraient pas préalablement transféré leurs activités. À cet égard, des dispositions 
européennes seraient bien évidemment préférables pour régler de façon uniforme toutes les 
questions pertinentes. Mais, si nécessaire et en complément, le projet de loi d’habilitation 
adopté par le Sénat et qui arrive en discussion à l’Assemblée nationale les 10 et 11 
décembre nous permettrait de prendre des dispositions françaises pour protéger 
juridiquement les ménages et les entreprises. Nous proposerions donc l’instauration d’un 
régime de transition adapté qui, pour la gestion extinctive des contrats, permette aux 
entreprises britanniques de poursuivre leurs activités initiées sous couvert de passeport 
européen, à condition de soumettre un programme de liquidation à l’ACPR. Nous souhaitons 
que ce régime transitoire soit intégré dans les ordonnances et qu’il confère à l’ACPR des 
pouvoirs similaires à ceux qui existent dans le cadre du passeport européen. Ce serait la 
contrepartie de la continuité qui serait accordée.  
 
II. Au-delà du Brexit, construire un Eurosystème financier 
À l’évidence, le Brexit est et restera une mauvaise nouvelle pour le Royaume-Uni, mais aussi 
pour l’Europe. Mais il peut aussi représenter en partie une opportunité pour restructurer le 
système financier européen. Nous avons un Eurosystème monétaire efficace – la BCE et les 
19 banques centrales nationales ; nous avons le cadre juridique du marché unique financier 
et – en partie – de l’Union bancaire ; nous avons une capacité d’épargne exceptionnelle, une 
 
Page 3 sur 4 
 
des premières du monde – 400 Mds€ pour l’épargne financière en zone euro, en flux annuel 
au deuxième trimestre 2018
ii
. Mais nous n’avons pas encore un « Eurosystème financier », 
fait d’institutions financières plus fortes et paneuropéennes, et d’infrastructures de marché 
partagées. Soyons clairs : il n’y aura pas une City unique pour le continent, mais plutôt un 
réseau polycentrique intégré de places financières, avec des spécialisations par domaines 
d’expertises. Un tel système polycentrique peut fonctionner, comme en témoigne l’exemple 
américain : la place financière de New York est privilégiée par les banques de financement 
et d’investissement, la place de Chicago traite des futures, tandis que celle de Boston est 
spécialisée dans la gestion d’actifs.  
Paris dispose de tous les atouts pour devenir le « hub marché » de cette nouvelle 
constellation européenne. Notre capitale abrite quatre des huit banques d'importance 
systémique mondiale de la zone euro, elle est numéro un dans l’assurance (vie et 
dommages) comme le secteur de la gestion d’actifs, elle dispose d’un marché obligataire de 
premier plan, du plus grand marché de titres négociables à court terme continental (NEU-
CP) et occupe la première place en matière de financement du capital-risque en Europe 
continentale. Les autorités financières françaises, y compris la Banque de France et l’ACPR, 
œuvrent également de concert pour faciliter la diffusion d’innovations financières saines et 
solides et pour favoriser le développement d’une finance verte. En outre, Paris offre le 
premier gisement de personnel hautement qualifié dans les services financiers. De 
nombreuses banques internationales ont donc déjà décidé de transférer à Paris la majorité 
de leurs activités de marché. 
Ce nouveau système suppose de disposer d’un cadre règlementaire unique (single rulebook) 
avec une mise en œuvre harmonisée. On s’en approche dans le secteur bancaire, mais c’est 
un peu moins le cas dans le secteur des assurances. Il est donc nécessaire de renforcer 
encore le rôle des autorités européennes de supervision et la France soutient – un peu trop 
seule encore – la réforme des ESA proposée par la Commission. Par exemple, il faut 
permettre à l’EIOPA de créer, de sa propre initiative, des plateformes de coopération pour 
mieux encadrer les entités dont l’activité provient en grande partie des opérations 
transfrontières réalisées au titre de la libre prestation de service. Il faut également renforcer 
le rôle de médiateur neutre de l’EIOPA dans le processus de validation des modèles internes 
au niveau groupe, sans pour autant lui donner un pouvoir direct dans le processus 
d’approbation, ce qui nuirait à sa neutralité.   
Cet  « Eurosystème financier » suppose aussi des infrastructures communes au sein de 
l’Union, capables d’offrir des services au-delà de la seule zone euro : les exemples de T2S 
et de TIPS, le nouveau système de règlement interbancaire des paiements instantanés, tous 
deux multidevises, nous montrent que c’est possible. Nous devons aussi traiter la question 
 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
des monopoles privés dans le secteur des chambres de compensation. Il faut veiller à ce 
que les acteurs essentiels ne deviennent pas « trop grands pour faire faillite » (too big to fail). 
Certes, la compensation est par nature une activité à fortes économies d’échelles, ce qui 
pousse à la concentration. Mais nous avons absolument besoin de davantage de 
concurrence pour favoriser l’innovation financière. Les opérations repos vont fort 
heureusement se regrouper à LCH SA début 2019. Plus largement, nous souhaitons le 
développement à Paris d’une offre de services de compensation renforcée et complétée 
dans le domaine des produits dérivés de taux d’intérêt.  
Au-delà, le Brexit représente une opportunité pour l’Europe de bien transformer sa propre 
épargne, pour renforcer sa capacité à financer l’économie réelle : c’est ce que j’appelle 
l’Union de financement et d’investissement pour l’innovation. Il s’agit de mieux diriger 
l’épargne abondante de la zone euro pour mieux stabiliser les chocs à l’intérieur de la zone 
euro et répondre aux besoins d’investissement et d’innovation : le numérique, la transition 
énergétique, les fonds propres des PME. En pratique, une vraie Union de financement passe 
par l’accélération de l’Union des marchés de capitaux et la finalisation de l’Union bancaire. 
Le « deuxième pilier » de résolution des banques en difficulté importe plus encore qu’une 
éventuelle garantie commune des dépôts. Et il est essentiel de lever les obstacles à des 
banques paneuropéennes transfrontières. C’est l’agenda politique franco-allemand de 
Meseberg en juin dernier : mais je souligne l’urgence à le concrétiser aujourd’hui. Au Brexit 
doit correspondre le renforcement économique et financier de la zone euro : si nous en 
restions aux arguties techniques, à l’autosatisfaction des uns et aux attaques des autres, et à 
la défiance de tous, nous aurions plus que manqué une opportunité. Nous aurions 
collectivement manqué à notre responsabilité. 
** 
C’est par là que je veux conclure. Les 27 ont fait preuve d’une unité impressionnante dans 
leur position sur le Brexit, derrière leur négociateur, Michel Barnier, qui a fait un travail 
remarquable. Et tous ont mieux pris la mesure – au moins en creux – de tous les avantages 
de notre Europe et de notre marché unique. Cette volonté politique « protectrice » doit 
désormais se prolonger dans une ambition « constructrice », pour bâtir une Europe plus 
efficace. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Climate Finance Day 2018 – Paris, 28 novembre 2018 
Le rôle de la finance :  anticiper les risques climatiques, 
 financer les opportunités liées à la transition

Gouverneur de la Banque de France

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un grand plaisir de conclure cette quatrième édition du Climate Finance 
Day. Cet évènement illustre ce que j’aime appeler la « puissante coalition 
des volontés ». Chacun d’entre nous – autorités publiques ; universitaires, 
ONG et think tanks ; entreprises et institutions financières – a un rôle à jouer 
dans cette coalition. C’est un défi partagé que nul ne peut affronter seul et vos 
travaux de ces trois derniers jours apportent des solutions concrètes pour 
financer au plus vite la transition.  
Chère Madame le Maire, Paris a joué un rôle moteur pour transformer une 
dynamique en action concrète. Permettez-moi de citer trois étapes 
importantes : la COP 21, qui remonte à 2015, le « One Planet Summit » en 
décembre 2017 et cette quatrième édition du Climate Finance Day. 
Lors du One Planet Summit, afin de remédier de façon plus concrète aux 
risques liés au changement climatique, la Banque de France a mis en place 
un Réseau pour le verdissement du système financier (Network for 
Greening the Financial System - NGFS), avec huit membres fondateursi. En 
moins d’un an, nous avons été rejoints par 13 autres membres ii  et cinq 
observateurs iii  venant des cinq continents. Ils travaillent ensemble avec 
beaucoup d’énergie et je dirais même d’enthousiasme.  
Dans mes remarques d’aujourd’hui, je (I) dresserai le bilan des réalisations du 
NGFS et je présenterai les étapes décisives qui nous attendent encore afin (II) 
d’anticiper les risques climatiques et (III) de saisir les opportunités.  
** 
I. Les premières réalisations du NGFS 
Comme cela a été souligné par le lauréat du Prix Nobel d’économie 2018, 
William Nordhaus, même si « une incertitude importante entoure la trajectoire 
du changement climatique et ses effets [...], cela ne réduit pas l’urgence à 
prendre aujourd’hui des mesures fortes pour lutter contre ce changement  iv ».  
Page 2 sur 7 
 
La responsabilité de la lutte contre le changement climatique – afin 
« d’empêcher l’avion de s’écraser » – incombe avant tout à des politiques 
publiques appropriées en matière d’énergie – à l’instar de celles  annoncées 
hier pour la France – de transports, de logement ou – et oui – de fiscalité et de 
tarification du carbone. La finance ne peut pas se substituer à ces politiques 
mais elle peut aider ; et en tant que banquiers centraux et superviseurs nous 
sommes déterminés à apporter notre aide. Je dirais même que ce défi est 
notre « nouvelle frontière », à l’instar du financement de la croissance et des 
grandes infrastructures au XIXe siècle ou de la gestion des grandes crises 
financières au cours des cent dernières années. 
Le rapport intermédiaire du NGFS, publié en octobre, représente un jalon 
important. De fait, pour la première fois, cette coalition de 21 v  banquiers 
centraux et de superviseurs désireux d’agir a reconnu à l’unanimité que les 
risques liés au climat – en tant que source de risque financier – relèvent du 
mandat des banques centrales. Le NGFS ne s’arrêtera pas là et publiera, 
l’année prochaine, un premier rapport qui proposera – sur la base du 
volontariat – des recommandations pour les banques centrales et les 
superviseurs. Cette publication coïncidera avec la prochaine conférence du 
NGFS qui se tiendra à Paris, à la Banque de France, le 17 avril 2019 : vous 
êtes bien sûr tous cordialement invités ! 
Pour éviter que l’avion ne s’écrase, nous pouvons aider en mettant la lumière 
sur les risques climatiques afin de prendre des décisions adéquates et 
opportunes ainsi qu’en saisissant les opportunités tout en alignant les 
incitations et en mobilisant les capitaux. 
II. Anticiper les risques liés au climat 
1/ Notre première priorité doit être la publication des expositions existantes 
dans le secteur financier, ce que j’appelle « une photographie des risques ». 
Les recommandations du Groupe de travail sur la publication d’informations 
financières relatives au climat (Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures - TCFD), présidé par M. Bloomberg sous l’égide du CSF, ont été 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
novatrices dans la mesure où elles fournissent un cadre concret permettant 
aux entreprises de publier leurs risques financiers liés au climat. Toutefois, 
une vision précise et cohérente des risques nécessite une mise en œuvre plus 
large des recommandations du TCFD.  
Or, des marges de progrès importantes demeurent dans ce domaine. Afin de 
permettre au marché de valoriser les risques, nous avons besoin de mesures 
comparables – grâce à une taxonomie commune – et d’un accès à des 
données de meilleure qualité et plus cohérentes. Je soutiens par conséquent 
pleinement les travaux du Groupe technique d’experts sur la finance durable 
de la Commission européenne qui développe de façon concrète une 
taxonomie ; notre premier groupe de travail du NGFS mène également des 
travaux dans ce domaine. 
Nous devons donc nous engager progressivement sur la voie d’une 
transparence obligatoire fondée sur le principe du « se conformer ou 
s’expliquer ». L’article 173 de la loi relative à la transition énergétique 
française – qui fait de la prise en compte des critères relatifs au respect 
d’objectifs sociaux, environnementaux et de qualité de gouvernance (ESG) 
une nouvelle norme de marché – pourrait servir de référence au niveau 
européen.  
2/ Au delà d’une « photographie des risques », le NGFS travaille à la 
réalisation d’une « vidéo des risques », avec des tests de résistance 
prospectifs de long terme pour mesurer les effets du changement climatique 
sur l’économie et la stabilité financière. Le NGFS élabore actuellement des 
scénarii économiques fondés sur les changements climatiques qui pourraient 
précisément être utilisés pour réaliser ces tests de résistance. Dans le même 
temps, l’ACPR a interrogé les banques et les sociétés d’assurance afin 
d’évaluer la manière dont sont intégrés les risques physiques et de transition 
dans leur gestion des risques. Les résultats seront publiés début 2019. Ils 
constitueront un point de départ pertinent pour évaluer les progrès réalisés 
jusqu’à présent par le secteur financier dans la prise en compte de ces deux 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
facteurs de risque. À ce stade, je conseillerais donc la prudence vis-à-vis des 
analyses de certaines ONG qui concluent à un « biais en faveur de l’énergie 
fossile » des banques françaises. En effet, leurs expositions aux grands 
risques associés au secteur pétrolier et gazier ont diminué entre 2015 et 2017.  
Ces données apporteront par ailleurs une contribution précieuse pour 
concevoir un nouveau cadre adéquat pour réaliser des tests de résistance et 
évaluer le risque climatique dans l’ensemble du système financier français. 
III. Financer les opportunités de la transition 
Comme tout bon pilote, nous voulons que notre avion « reprenne de 
l’altitude ». Et notre objectif pour ce faire n’est pas seulement de gérer les 
risques liés au changement climatique, mais également d’harmoniser les 
incitations afin de garantir le financement adéquat de la transition.  
À mesure que le temps passe et que notre capacité à parvenir à un scénario 
compatible avec un réchauffement de 1,5 à 2°C est sérieusement remise en 
question, le montant nécessaire pour financer la transition augmente de façon 
constante. Ce défi quantitatif est lié aux investissements massifs requis afin 
de promouvoir la poursuite des évolutions technologiques, en particulier le 
captage et le stockage du carbone ainsi que la production d’électricité à l’aide 
de ressources renouvelables. Les montants en jeu varient mais, à titre 
d’illustration, selon les estimations présentées par le Groupe d’experts 
intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC) dans leur dernier rapport 
d’octobre dernier, les investissements nécessaires afin de limiter le 
réchauffement climatique à 1,5°C représentent 900 milliards de dollars par an 
jusqu’en 2050 vi. Les besoins sont tels que le financement public à lui seul ne 
suffira jamais. Or, ce montant représente, par an, moins de 1 % du PIB 
mondial en 2017. La charge est élevée, mais pas du tout insurmontable si 
nous joignons nos forces. Je souhaiterais d’abord parler du secteur privé 
avant de revenir aux banques centrales. 
1 / Fort heureusement, le secteur privé montre déjà un intérêt croissant pour la 
finance verte. Je pourrais citer de nombreux exemples, notamment la forte 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
hausse observée sur le marché des obligations alignées sur des objectifs 
climatiques, dont l’encours a atteint 1 450 milliards de dollars vii en 2018, ou 
le succès de l’émission des premières obligations souveraines vertes en 
France en janvier 2017. Tout cela semble très prometteur... mais ce n’est pas 
encore suffisant. Le succès de la transition dépendra également de notre 
capacité à élargir les sources de financement : nous ne devons pas nous 
contenter uniquement des obligations vertes. Il nous faut plus de prêts verts, 
et plus de financements verts en général, accessibles aux particuliers, aux 
PME et aux start-ups. 
La mobilisation de ces capitaux suscite également des défis qualitatifs. Le 
renforcement ordonné de la finance verte nécessite de tenir les marchés à 
l’écart des pratiques d’écoblanchiment (green washing). L’émergence d’un 
nouvel écosystème de « bons produits » financiers, tels que les obligations 
vertes, les obligations à impact social et les obligations liées aux objectifs de 
développement durable (ODD) est sans doute une bonne nouvelle. Mais nous 
devons veiller à ne pas susciter de confusion face à une diversité de 
définitions susceptibles de discréditer les marchés verts et d’entraver leurs 
progrès. La définition d’une norme européenne fondée sur des principes 
communs en ce qui concerne la gestion des fonds et les évaluations d’impact, 
combinée à une taxonomie verte commune, est essentielle afin de protéger 
l’intégrité des marchés. Il serait tout à fait logique de s’appuyer, notamment, 
sur les deux normes les plus répandues : l’approche Green Bond Principles et 
l’approche Climate Bond Initiative. 
2 / Les banques centrales doivent également émettre le bon signal et donner 
l’exemple dans leurs politiques d’investissement et de publication des 
informations. À la Banque de France, en mars de cette année, nous avons 
adopté une charte d’investissement responsable pour la gestion de nos 
fonds propres et de nos portefeuilles de retraite, afin qu’ils soient alloués à des 
fonds d’investissement responsables sur le plan social et environnemental. 
S’agissant de la publication des informations, nous publierons en mars 2019 
les expositions aux risques liés au climat de nos fonds propres et de nos 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
portefeuilles de retraite. Nous travaillons également à l’adoption dans un 
avenir proche de modalités de publication analogues à celles prônées par le 
TCFD, et qui tiendront compte des spécificités des banques centrales.  
S’agissant du rôle de la politique monétaire, certains appellent à un 
« assouplissement quantitatif vert ». Mais la politique monétaire doit être de 
portée générale et rester neutre pour garantir le bon fonctionnement de ses 
canaux de transmission ; elle ne peut avoir pour cible un impact social ou 
sectoriel spécifique. Toutefois, cela n’empêche pas l’Eurosystème d’acheter 
des actifs verts lorsque ceux-ci sont couverts par les critères d’éligibilité de ses 
programmes d’achats d’actifs. En effet, la BCE détient actuellement 
79 milliards d’euros environ de l’ensemble des obligations vertes éligibles 
émises par le secteur public ainsi que par le secteur privé viii, ce qui constitue 
déjà un montant significatif. 
Cela ne signifie pas pour autant que la politique monétaire doit ignorer la 
question du changement climatique. Dans le cadre de notre mandat de 
maintien de la stabilité des prix, je suis fermement convaincu que des travaux 
d’analyse supplémentaires sont nécessaires afin de mieux comprendre 
l’impact à moyen et long terme du changement climatique sur les objectifs 
intermédiaires de la politique monétaire et, en définitive, sur notre stratégie de 
politique monétaire. À cette fin, un important programme de recherche nous 
attend et j’espère que le NGFS contribuera à combler le « déficit de 
connaissances » dans ce domaine.  En outre, d’un point de vue opérationnel, 
si des éléments montrent que les risques liés à la transition et les risques 
physiques ont un impact sur le profil de risque de certains actifs, les banques 
centrales doivent en tirer les conséquences et intégrer ces risques financiers 
dans leur dispositif de garanties (collateral framework).

J’aimerais conclure en reprenant le message de Paul Romer dans son 
discours prononcé à l’occasion de la remise du prix Nobel : « Les êtres 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
humains sont capables d’accomplir des choses étonnantes s’ils y mettent du 
leur ». S’agissant des risques liés au climat, en moins d’un an, les banques 
centrales et les superviseurs ont franchi des étapes concrètes afin d’intégrer la 
finance verte dans l’ensemble de leurs activités. Indépendamment des progrès 
politiques que nous souhaitons tous à l’échelle internationale, nous sommes 
déterminés, en tant qu’autorités financières, à suivre notre « plan de vol ». Je 
vous remercie de votre attention.

Quelles perspectives économiques pour la zone euro ?

Mesdames, Messieurs,  
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous ce soir à l’Université LUISS, dans cette 
magnifique salle de bal de la Villa Blanc, et je tiens à remercier 
chaleureusement la Vice-Présidente Paola Severino. L’Université LUISS est 
bien connue pour l’excellence de son enseignement et l’un de vos illustres 
anciens présidents, Guido Carli, qui a donné son nom à votre Université, fut 
l’un des signataires du Traité de Maastricht en 1992.  
Aujourd’hui, je m’exprime devant vous en ami de l’Italie, un pays qui m’est 
cher. Pendant plusieurs années de ma vie professionnelle, je suis venu tous 
les mois à Rome, et j’ai eu le plaisir d’apprendre votre langue. Je suis heureux 
de la présence ici de mon ami le Gouverneur Ignazio Visco, qui est mon voisin 
le plus proche à Francfort : nous y sommes assis côte à côte. Je viens aussi 
en Européen convaincu, qui connait bien l’Allemagne ou la Belgique. C’est 
également l’engagement de Sylvie Goulard, présente aujourd’hui comme 
sous-gouverneur de la Banque de France. Je suis très conscient de l’ampleur 
des défis auxquels l’Italie est confrontée, dont jusqu’à une période récente les 
flux migratoires, d’autant plus que nous partageons une culture, une histoire et 
aujourd’hui des institutions et des défis communs. En tant que banquier 
central, je vais cependant me concentrer sur l’aspect économique, et 
notamment sur notre monnaie partagée et sur la zone euro.  
** 
En préambule, je voudrais rappeler quelques faits stylisés, parfois trop vite 
oubliés. L’Italie est forte de nombreux atouts : c’est la deuxième industrie 
de la zone euro, après l’Allemagne mais devant la France. Ses performances 
à l’export se sont améliorées ces dernières années, notamment grâce à une 
plus grande spécialisation dans les produits à forte valeur ajoutéei et au génie 
de ses « imprenditori », de Brescia à Bologne. De plus, grâce en partie aux 
réformes engagées par les gouvernements italiens successifs depuis 2012, la 
situation macroéconomique de l’Italie est globalement solide [slide]. Pour citer 
quelques indicateurs clés : une position extérieure nette, presque à l’équilibre 
Page 2 sur 9 
 
(- 5 % du PIB en 2017), et meilleure que celle de la France ; un compte 
courant excédentaire depuis 2013 (2,8 % du PIB en 2017) ; et un endettement 
privé plus faible que dans la moyenne de la zone euro. Oui, l’Italie – comme 
l’Europe d’ailleurs – peut avoir beaucoup plus de fiertés qu’on ne le dit. La 
fierté permet davantage de sérénité, sans agressivité. Et elle n’exclut pas la 
lucidité.  
L’Italie est en effet moins en croissance qu’elle ne le devrait [slide]. Le PIB 
réel n’a pas retrouvé son niveau d’avant la crise. Le PIB réel par tête est, 
quant à lui, inférieur à son niveau de 2007. Cette faiblesse du taux de 
croissance est une raison centrale du fort taux d’endettement public, en 
augmentation depuis 2008. Autre conséquence de la faible croissance : un fort 
taux de chômage, particulièrement élevé chez les jeunes (32 % en septembre 
2018 chez les 15-24 ans). Le drame des « scoraggiati », notamment au Sud, 
ce doit être le nôtre à tous.  
C’est avec ce paysage sous les yeux ici et maintenant, à Rome, que je veux 
éclairer les perspectives économiques pour la zone euro. Je souhaite partager 
avec vous deux convictions :  
- par rapport aux défis qui sont les nôtres, l’euro est du côté des solutions, et 
non des problèmes ; 
- mais pour construire une zone euro plus solidaire, nous avons besoin d’une 
Italie engagée. 
** 
I. L’euro est du côté des solutions, non des problèmes.  
La tentation existe d’attribuer à l’euro cette faible croissance. Dans cette vue, 
la monnaie unique serait un carcan imposé à nos pays par l’Allemagne, et 
géré par « Francfort » au bénéfice de celle-ci. Tout débat est légitime, et nous 
ne devons pas fuir celui-ci. Mais l’euro est au contraire du côté des 
solutions, pour quatre raisons. Deux sont liées au temps long, à ces vingt 
ans de l’euro que nous allons marquer le 1er janvier prochain : la volonté 
historique ; le bilan économique. Et deux sont liées à la nature même des 
Page 3 sur 9 
 
politiques économiques pratiquées aujourd’hui : la politique monétaire unique ; 
et la décentralisation des autres politiques. 
1/ Permettez-moi d’abord un bref rappel historique : dès le début, l’Italie et la 
France ont voulu l’euro, beaucoup plus que l’Allemagne. Je me souviens de 
Rome en décembre 1990 où, depuis le Palazzo Montecitorio, nous avons 
ouvert la Conférence intergouvernementale sur l’Union économique et 
monétaire – c’est Guido Carli justement qui présidait. Nous avons ensuite bâti 
l’euro, ensemble, pas à pas – et depuis lors, Français et Italiens – de 
Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa à Mario Draghi – l’ont géré bien plus que les 
Allemands. 
Alors oui, Francfort est en Allemagne… comme Bruxelles est en Belgique. 
Mais le poids de l’Italie et de la France dans la décision est beaucoup plus 
grand qu’avant, car à l’époque de la lire et du franc, nos politiques monétaires 
devaient en pratique quasiment se conformer à celle de l’Allemagne. Il ne 
nous restait qu’une liberté, celle de dévaluer périodiquement nos monnaies ; 
c’était humiliant aussi, et surtout appauvrissant pour les peuples. Au-delà des 
effets bénéfiques de court terme liés à la baisse du prix des exportations, les 
effets négatifs à moyen terme des dévaluations sont potentiellement bien plus 
élevés, nous les avons un peu oubliés : inflation via le renchérissement du prix 
des importations, baisse de la valeur du patrimoine du pays et augmentation 
de ses dettes extérieures. La créativité italienne, votre génie commercial 
depuis Venise, Gênes et Florence, comptent beaucoup plus que la facilité 
d’une lire faible. 
2/ La seconde raison, c’est le bilan économique. Depuis vingt ans, l’Italie et la 
France ont fortement bénéficié des avantages de la monnaie unique :  
- la stabilité des prix [slide], c’est-à-dire une maîtrise de l’inflation qui 
préserve le pouvoir d’achat des ménages. Avant l’euro, l’inflation pouvait 
atteindre des niveaux très élevés en Europe : 8,1 % en moyenne en Italie 
dans les 20 ans précédant l’euro, contre 1,8 % dans les 20 dernières 
années.  
Page 4 sur 9 
 
- la stabilité des financements à travers la baisse très nette des taux d’intérêt 
et des écarts entre les pays – les « spreads » [slide]. Par exemple, le 
spread entre l’Italie et l’Allemagne a été divisé par plus de 2 : il était de 
5,1 % en moyenne sur la période 1986-1992 – celle du marché unique 
sans la monnaie unique, entre l’Acte unique européen qui a suivi le Conseil 
de Milan, et Maastricht –, contre 1,9 % sur la période 2017-2018, même s’il 
a remonté récemment compte tenu d’incertitudes réapparues. Et en 
France, il est passé de 1,9 % à 0,4 %. Si donc par hypothèse – à laquelle 
je ne crois pas –, un de nos pays devait revenir à l’avant-euro, ceci aurait 
un coût élevé sur le financement de sa dette publique comme de la dette 
de ses ménages et entreprises. Pour l’Italie, ceci représenterait à terme 
une augmentation de la charge de la dette de plus de 70 milliards d’euros 
par an, soit davantage que l’ensemble des dépenses publiques pour 
l’éducation. 
Les citoyens sont en conséquence très attachés à la monnaie unique : 61 % 
des Italiens et 70 % des Français soutiennent l’euro aujourd’huiii. Et ce soutien 
populaire, partout, est un des plus grands succès de l’euro. 
3/  Les deux dernières raisons tiennent à la nature même du système original 
qui unit les 19 pays de la zone euro : la politique monétaire est partagée ; les 
autres politiques économiques sont décentralisées. Commençons par notre 
politique monétaire : l’engagement de l’Eurosystème depuis la crise de 2011 
a été décisif pour réduire la fragmentation entre les pays de la zone euro. 
[slide] Les taux d’intérêt ont plus baissé en Italie qu’ailleurs, pour les 
entreprises, les ménages et l’État, et les banques italiennes ont reçu plus de 
liquidités qu’ailleurs. Ceci fait dire à certains que notre politique monétaire est 
menée aujourd’hui pour bénéficier à l’Italie : ils ont tort. La politique monétaire 
ne peut pas être menée pour un seul pays : ni l’Allemagne, ni la France, ni 
l’Italie. Le Conseil des gouverneurs décide collectivement, et indépendamment 
de toute influence, et sa position est d’ailleurs claire : aucune politique 
budgétaire nationale ne doit influencer notre politique monétaire commune, ni 
aujourd’hui, ni demain. Nous devons, de par le mandat qui nous a été confié 
Page 5 sur 9 
 
démocratiquement, avoir une seule boussole : la stabilité des prix dans toute 
la zone euro, avec une inflation à moyen terme inférieure à mais proche de 
2 %. Et c’est ainsi que nous contribuons à la croissance durable, en gérant le 
cycle économique et en assurant des taux d’intérêt bas. 
4/ Ceci amène à la quatrième raison : en zone euro, les politiques 
budgétaires et structurelles sont de la responsabilité des États eux-
mêmes. Nous avons construit un système fondé sur le principe de 
subsidiarité, qui laisse le maximum de décisions au niveau national. C’est une 
bonne nouvelle pour la démocratie. La contrepartie de cette décentralisation, 
c’est bien sûr le respect d’un minimum de règles, dont le Pacte de stabilité et 
de croissance.  
Mais le respect de ces règles est aussi dans notre intérêt national. Si les 
déficits et la dette publics étaient la clé de la croissance, nos deux pays en 
seraient les champions en Europe : ce n’est malheureusement pas le cas. À 
court terme, il n’est pas sûr qu’un déficit accru, s’il s’accompagne globalement 
d’une prime de risque accrue sur les taux d’intérêt, ait un effet positif sur la 
croissance. La très récente Revue de stabilité financière de la Banque d'Italie 
a notamment estimé les coûts de transmission de spreads publics accrus vers 
les entreprises et les ménages italiens, à travers à la fois des taux d'intérêt 
plus élevés et de moindres volumes de prêtsiii. À plus long terme, aucun pays 
ne peut laisser sa dette publique toujours augmenter. Au-delà du risque 
d’insolvabilité, il y a là une question d’équité : c’est un fardeau qui se transmet 
aux générations futures.  
Je n’ai évidemment pas à me prononcer sur les choix italiens, car les solutions 
vous appartiennent. L’Italie a su dans son histoire se moderniser en 
profondeur. La persévérance est souvent une vertu difficile, dans nos deux 
pays. Mais mener des réformes d’ampleur dans la durée semble être la clé de 
la croissance, comme le montrent les exemples de nos partenaires européens 
[slide]. Les succès sont au Nord de l’Europe, mais aussi au Sud avec 
Page 6 sur 9 
 
l’Espagne et le Portugal ; et ils sont partout compatibles avec le modèle social 
que nous partageons et soutenons tous.  
Nos deux pays ont des fragilités persistantes, notamment sur le marché du 
travail, avec un taux de chômage trop élevé. Mais notre fragilité la plus 
largement partagée est le retard en matière de formation et d’éducation. 
Environ un quart des adultes en Italie et en France ont un faible niveau de 
compréhension de l’écrit iv  et les résultats de l’enquête PISA de suivi des 
élèves ne sont pas meilleurs. Au total, plus d’un quart des jeunes de 18 à 24 
ans en Italie et 19 % en France ne sont ni en emploi, ni en études, ni en 
formation, soit nettement plus que la moyenne de l’OCDE à 14 %. Et donc 
nous n’avons pas de priorité plus grande que le développement des 
compétences, de l’apprentissage, et de la formation professionnelle. 
Parallèlement aux bonnes réformes dans nos deux pays, la décentralisation 
dans la zone euro appelle une autre conséquence : il faut un ajustement plus 
symétrique, avec des relances salariales et budgétaires dans les pays qui 
disposent de marges de manœuvre pour le faire, comme l’Allemagne et les 
Pays-Bas. Cette relance a heureusement commencé, avec les plans 
budgétaires des coalitions élues en 2017, et une augmentation plus rapide des 
salaires à mesure que ces pays sont proches du plein emploi. Les excédents 
extérieurs excessifs sont aussi le signe d’une mauvaise allocation des 
ressources. La Procédure concernant les déséquilibres macroéconomiques, 
menée par la Commission européenne, doit donc être symétrique.  
 
II. Pour construire une zone euro plus solidaire, nous avons besoin 
d’une Italie engagée.  
Pour autant, la zone euro doit être améliorée : si l’Union monétaire est un 
succès, la faiblesse de l’Union économique reste un problème. Nous nous 
devons de trouver un « chemin de crête » combinant responsabilité et 
solidarité. La France et l’Allemagne ont, depuis Meseberg, en juin dernier, fait 
des premières propositions. Je sais combien ce sujet est sensible en Italie… 
Page 7 sur 9 
 
mais je voudrais le dire en ami : acceptez de regarder et discuter le fond, 
avant de vous inquiéter du principe même d’une discussion franco-allemande, 
souvent nécessaire mais jamais suffisante. Et soyez assurés que l’Italie est 
ardemment souhaitée autour de la table des négociations, et trouvera je le 
crois, son intérêt dans un renforcement de la solidarité privée et publique.   
1/ La première priorité est d’accroître le partage du risque privé. Il faut ici 
partir des besoins réels, et notamment ceux des entreprises et des 
entrepreneurs. Pour investir et innover, sur le digital ou sur la transition 
énergétique par exemple, les entreprises doivent être capables de prendre 
davantage de risques. Ceci nécessite plus de financement par fonds propres, 
sur le long terme, plutôt que du financement par la dette. Dans ce domaine, la 
zone euro est très en retard : les fonds propres représentaient seulement 
77 % du PIB mi-2018, contre 124 % aux États-Unis. Et pourtant, nous avons 
des ressources abondantes : environ 350 milliards d’euros d’épargne 
excédentaire en zone euro. [slide] Nous devons donc construire une « Union 
de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » pour faire se 
rencontrer ces ressources et ces besoins.  
Cette Union est la somme de deux initiatives existantes, et d’abord l’Union 
bancaire, qui nécessite d’être enfin finalisée. La priorité est de compléter le « 
deuxième pilier » de résolution des banques en difficulté, avec la mise en 
place d’un filet de sécurité commun au Fonds de résolution unique, un 
« common backstop ». Sa mise en place doit être parallèle à une réduction 
suffisante des risques, mais elle ne doit pas être retardée par l’accumulation 
de critères quantitatifs rigides. En outre, il est essentiel de lever les obstacles 
aux consolidations transfrontières saines, qui permettraient aux banques de 
mieux faire circuler l’épargne au-delà des frontières nationales. Mais cette 
Union de financement doit aussi s’appuyer sur l’Union des marchés de 
capitaux. Celle-ci fait l’objet d’un consensus politique, mais il faut maintenant 
la faire avancer concrètement sur la révision des lois de faillite et le 
renforcement de l’ESMA.  
Page 8 sur 9 
 
2/ Au-delà du partage du risqué privé, un dispositif public partagé de 
solidarité est indispensable [slide]. L’un des axes en est le renforcement du 
Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES), et notamment de ses instruments 
de précaution : la prévention crédible des crises nécessite non seulement 
une discipline budgétaire, mais aussi de disposer des instruments nécessaires 
pour aider un État membre à amortir les chocs asymétriques susceptibles 
d’apparaître brutalement, en dépit de tous ses efforts. Pour être efficaces, les 
instruments de précaution devront à mon sens s’appuyer sur des critères ex 
ante objectifs et simples [tels que le respect des règles], plutôt que sur la 
lourde conditionnalité actuelle, trop proche d’un programme d’assistance. Le 
budget de la zone euro, proposé par la France, pourrait lui aussi jouer un rôle 
stabilisateur, en soutenant les investissements, notamment dans l’éducation et 
la formation et, bien sûr, les nouvelles technologies, lorsque les finances 
publiques nationales sont contraintes. Les discussions sur le MES soulèvent 
un autre sujet, dont je sais qu’il est sensible en Italie : celui de la 
restructuration des dettes souveraines. La France considère aussi qu’il faut 
être prudent dans ce domaine. Il n’est pas souhaitable d’adopter une approche 
mécanique car lorsque les règles sont automatiques, les anticipations des 
marchés peuvent déclencher des réactions en chaîne brutales et mettre la 
stabilité financière en danger. En revanche, une réflexion technique sur les 
modalités des clauses d’action collectives (CAC) peut être utile. 
** 
Je voudrais conclure en citant le Président Luigi Einaudi qui écrivait dès 1954 : 
« Dans la vie des nations, l’erreur consistant à manquer des opportunités 
éphémères est souvent irréparable. Le besoin d’unir l’Europe est évident. […] 
Le problème ne réside pas entre l’indépendance et l’union ; il réside entre le 
fait d’exister unis ou de disparaître.v» Dans notre monde marqué par des 
incertitudes croissantes – dont hélas beaucoup proviennent aussi des États-
Unis –, la nécessité de préserver et renforcer l’unité de l’Europe n’en est que 
plus forte. Sans nier aucun des problèmes, et en agissant ensemble pour ce 
Page 9 sur 9 
 
que nous voulons, Français et Italiens : une Europe plus efficace et plus 
solidaire. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence conjointe ICMIF/AMICE sur les aspects réglementaires 
 
Paris, mardi 4 décembre 2018 
 
 
 
 
Discours de Denis Beau  
Premier sous-gouverneur 
 
 
 
 
« Anciens et nouveaux défis pour le secteur des assurances, 
ses régulateurs et ses superviseurs » 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
Bonjour à tous, chers présidents et membres de l’ICMIF et de l’AMICE. 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui pour un échange de vues sur les enjeux 
tout aussi innovants que complexes, auxquels le secteur des assurances, et en particulier 
les mutuelles, ainsi que leurs régulateurs et leurs superviseurs, devront faire face dans les 
mois et les années à venir. 
 
Après avoir présenté brièvement le contexte économique et financier et les défis qui 
en découlent pour les assureurs, j’évoquerai les défis résultant des évolutions 
réglementaires actuellement en cours d’élaboration et je terminerai par les nouveaux 
risques auxquels les assureurs, leurs régulateurs et leurs superviseurs doivent faire 
face, à savoir les cyber-risques et les risques liés au changement climatique. 
 
Dans l’ensemble, l’environnement macroéconomique a été favorable. La reprise de 
l’économie mondiale s’est raffermie l’année dernière. Le PIB mondial a augmenté de 3,8 % 
en 2017 et la croissance devrait demeurer proche de ce niveau pour les deux prochaines 
années. L’économie européenne a enregistré de bons résultats et le taux d’inflation en 
Europe est conforme à l’objectif de la Banque centrale européenne (2 %). Même si les 
données d’enquêtes récentes ont été légèrement plus faibles, les perspectives à moyen 
terme pour la zone euro demeurent globalement positives.  
 
Toutefois, les incertitudes se renforcent au niveau mondial et sur le plan intérieur. Le 
resserrement de la politique monétaire, en réponse à l’amélioration de la situation 
économique, peut avoir un impact sur la croissance des principales économies avancées. La 
Réserve fédérale des États-Unis et la Banque d’Angleterre ont progressivement relevé leurs 
taux d’intérêt directeurs ; parallèlement, la Banque centrale européenne a commencé à sortir 
progressivement de son programme d’achats d’obligations (QE). L’impact de la 
normalisation de la politique monétaire sur les marchés financiers doit faire l’objet 
d’un suivi attentif. Le sentiment global des marchés est à l’optimisme, mais on voit 
apparaître les signes d’un éventuel mouvement de réévaluation des prix sur les marchés 
financiers. La volatilité des marchés s’est accrue depuis le début de l’année et des 
corrections de prix ont été observées, tout particulièrement sur les marchés d’actions. Les 
valorisations demeurent tendues sur les marchés boursiers et obligataires et sur certains 
marchés immobiliers, entraînant un risque élevé de réévaluation des actifs. Les tensions 
récentes sur les marchés émergents, en particulier en Turquie et en Argentine, ont provoqué 
des reports vers les valeurs dites sûres, principalement au profit d’investissements aux 
États-Unis. À court terme, les menaces sur le commerce mondial liées aux tensions 
3 
 
protectionnistes, ainsi que les incertitudes politiques croissantes, qui touchent 
également l’Europe suite aux évolutions intervenues en Italie et à la forte probabilité 
d’un Brexit « dur », pourraient peser négativement sur l’environnement mondial. 
 
De plus, ces quatre dernières années, le secteur européen de l’assurance a été 
confronté à un contexte difficile et sans précédent de faible taux d’intérêt. La tendance 
baissière des rendements obligataires a eu un impact direct sur le rendement des 
placements, notamment pour les sociétés d’assurance-vie qui détiennent une part 
importante de leurs investissements en titres obligataires. La dilution des rendements des 
investissements a renforcé les risques pesant sur le secteur : notamment un sérieux 
risque de rachat massif en cas de remontée brutale des taux d’intérêt, un risque de pertes 
financières pour les assureurs qui garantissent des taux techniques élevés par rapport aux 
rendements financiers, ou encore des risques liés à une couverture insuffisante des coûts.  
 
Dans cette revue rapide des principales caractéristiques de l’environnement dans lequel 
opèrent les assureurs, je souhaiterais ajouter que le risque lié au changement 
climatique est à présent devenu une réalité et, même si en général les assureurs savent 
comment traiter ces risques climatiques, y compris lors d’évènements extrêmes, il est plus 
que probable que de nouvelles évolutions soient nécessaires.   
 
Dans ce contexte, les sociétés d’assurance françaises ont réagi selon trois axes 
principaux : une baisse des taux d’intérêt versés au titre de l’assurance-vie, le 
développement de stratégies alternatives d’investissement et l’adaptation de leur 
modèle d’activité traditionnel, avec notamment une diversification accrue des 
activités. En conséquence, par exemple, les contrats en unités de compte sont en 
augmentation et, pour les contrats en euros, les revalorisations diminuent. Je note toutefois 
que les revalorisations demeurent nettement supérieures pour les mutuelles : elles se sont 
élevées à 2,3 %  des encours l’année dernière, alors que la moyenne française est 
inférieure. Les provisions pour participation différée aux bénéfices ont été sensiblement 
renforcées et représentent approximativement 6 % des provisions mathématiques à fin 2017, 
soit 50 % de plus que la moyenne française.  
 
En conséquence, les sociétés d’assurance françaises demeurent solides et les fonds 
propres détenus couvrent largement le capital de solvabilité requis par la 
réglementation (SCR) pour les sociétés d’assurance-vie et non-vie. Cela constitue un 
atout important dans l’environnement difficile dans lequel ces sociétés opèrent. C’est 
notamment le cas pour le secteur mutualiste. Son ratio de couverture du SCR dépasse 
4 
 
largement 300 %, ce qui est plus élevé que la moyenne en France, grâce notamment à une 
approche prudente et de long terme, avec une pression moins forte des marchés financiers.  
 
Toutefois, s’adapter à un environnement complexe nécessite aussi de prendre en 
compte de nouveaux risques. Les risques liés à la protection et au conseil des 
assurés, à l’allongement excessif des maturités des obligations ou à une quête de 
rendement trop agressive doivent être suivis avec attention. 
 
Je souhaiterais à présent mettre l’accent sur les évolutions réglementaires, qui sont 
nombreuses et susceptibles d’avoir un impact sur l’évolution du modèle d’activité des 
sociétés d’assurance. Le paysage français de l’assurance a connu des évolutions 
réglementaires majeures au cours des dernières années : une modification du régime 
fiscal des contrats d’assurance-vie/d’épargne (Flat Tax), la possibilité de résilier 
annuellement l’assurance emprunteur (Loi Hamon/Amendement Bourquin) et la création d’un 
statut prudentiel spécifique pour les fonds de pension français. La nouvelle loi Pacte devrait 
apporter de nouveaux changements, avec comme objectif de favoriser l’investissement à 
long terme en actions, notamment par une réforme du support d’assurance-vie à long terme 
français (également appelé Eurocroissance).  
 
En outre, d’importantes évolutions réglementaires sont également en cours aux niveaux 
international et européen. Au niveau international, les travaux de l’IAIS relatifs aux 
assureurs systémiques et à la norme internationale sur le capital des sociétés 
d’assurance (International Capital Standard - ICS) ont récemment enregistré des 
progrès significatifs. Comme vous le savez, dans le cadre de son plan d’action 
d’après-crise, l’IAIS a élaboré en 2013 une méthode d’identification des risques systémiques, 
qui a fait l’objet d’une révision en 2016. Cette méthode a permis d’identifier neuf assureurs 
d’importance systémique à l’échelle mondiale, qui font l’objet de mesures spécifiques 
(supervision renforcée, plans de gestion spécifiques – essentiellement pour la liquidité, le 
redressement et la résolution – et exigences de capital supplémentaires, actuellement 
repoussées à 2022). Compte tenu des lacunes manifestes de la méthodologie, notamment 
sa base factuelle insuffisante, le CSF a demandé à l’IAIS de la réexaminer selon trois 
axes, parmi lesquels : développer une approche fondée sur les activités en 
complément de celle fondée sur les entités, qui fera elle-même l’objet d’une révision 
afin d’en combler les insuffisances. Par conséquent, un nouveau cadre est en cours 
d’élaboration, qui permettra de concilier une approche fondée sur les activités et une 
approche fondée sur l’entité, afin de mieux prendre en compte les risques concernés et les 
entités d’importance systémique. Dans l’intervalle, la liste des assureurs d’importance 
5 
 
systémique à l’échelle mondiale restera gelée en 2019 et pourrait être suspendue au-delà et 
jusqu’en 2022, le temps d’acquérir suffisamment d’expérience à partir de la nouvelle 
approche. 
 
S’agissant de l’ICS, qui a pour objet d’élaborer une norme internationale sur le capital afin 
d’établir une base comparable en termes d’exigences prudentielles pour l’ensemble des 
groupes internationaux, de récents progrès ont été accomplis à Kuala Lumpur en 
novembre 2017, qui devraient permettre de développer d’ici fin 2019 une version 
« ICS 2.0 » qui servira de référence dans les collèges internationaux de supervision, 
pour une période transitoire de cinq ans. Pendant cette période, chaque groupe 
d’assurance opérant à l’échelle internationale sera tenu de garantir une période de suivi 
obligatoire et confidentielle de cinq ans, après quoi la norme devrait entrer en vigueur.  
 
S’agissant à présent de la norme IFRS 17, il ne serait pas raisonnable d’appliquer tout 
de suite le nouveau cadre comptable IFRS 17. Étant donné le problème évident de 
calendrier, on peut saluer la réouverture par l’IASB de la discussion et le fait que 
l’application de cette norme ait été repoussée d’un an. Cela nous donnera surtout le 
temps de parvenir à un accord sur l’identification des groupes de contrats déficitaires. Nous 
voulons également mener à bien la discussion relative au traitement des contrats de 
réassurance détenus. À ce stade, la norme offre trop de possibilités d’interprétation, ce qui 
pourrait nuire à la comparabilité et à la cohérence de son application entre les pays. 
 
En Europe, en ce moment, le « sujet sensible » concerne la révision prochaine de 
Solvabilité 2. 
Cette révision doit inclure une évaluation complète et objective du cadre en vigueur depuis 
trois ans maintenant.  
Bien sûr, les assureurs ont amélioré de manière significative leur gestion du risque et 
du capital dans le cadre de Solvabilité 2, et le marché de l’assurance est actuellement 
plus résilient et mieux équipé pour faire face aux crises financières. Le taux moyen de 
couverture du SCR dans l’Union européenne s’élevait à 241 % au premier trimestre 2018. Il 
tend à être encore plus élevé pour les mutuelles.  
Mais ces points positifs ne doivent pas pour autant éclipser les questions qui se 
posent nécessairement après un changement aussi radical, en particulier celles 
concernant l’impact sur l’investissement en actions et sur le financement de 
l’économie européenne, ainsi que les questions liées à la volatilité et à la complexité.  
6 
 
Par conséquent, j’invite les assureurs à jouer un rôle actif dans les discussions que devrait 
susciter le « paquet branches longues », ou « révision 2020 ». Comme ce fut le cas pour la 
révision 2018, l’ACPR appellera à de nouveaux progrès en faveur d’une nette 
simplification du cadre. Nous espérons également que la révision prendra mieux en 
compte l’impact de Solvabilité 2 sur le financement de l’économie.  
Cela étant, et quelle que soit l’issue des prochaines révisions, le principe de proportionnalité 
et son application harmonisée dans l’ensemble de l’Union européenne demeurera une 
préoccupation de premier plan pour l’EIOPA et bien sûr pour l’ACPR. 
Me référant à l’actualité, j’ajoute qu’il est primordial pour les superviseurs d’appliquer 
l’intégralité des exigences prudentielles avec une rigueur égale. Les défaillances en 
cascade d’assureurs étrangers exerçant leur activité sur le marché français dans le cadre de 
la libre prestation de services, en particulier dans le domaine de l’assurance-construction, en 
constituent une bonne illustration. La libre prestation de services entre parfois en conflit avec 
les spécificités des marchés nationaux. La complexité et l’horizon à long terme de certains 
produits nécessitent une amélioration des compétences des assureurs qui les offrent ainsi 
que des autorités de surveillance, avec le soutien de l’AEAPP. La convergence requise 
des pratiques en matière de surveillance doit très vite devenir une réalité. Je sais que 
pour l’EIOPA, c’est une priorité. 
À cet égard, l’examen conduit tous les trois ans par les autorités européennes de 
surveillance (AES) est en cours. Après une consultation publique proposée par la 
Commission européenne, le projet de législation a pour but de renforcer le rôle et les 
pouvoirs des autorités – principalement de l’EIOPA – sans remettre en question l’architecture 
existante. Cela devrait soutenir l’objectif de convergence accrue des pratiques prudentielles, 
qui devrait à son tour contribuer à améliorer leur efficacité. 
La proposition représente donc une avancée positive pour l’Europe. Il convient toutefois de 
rester vigilant sur le rôle attribué aux superviseurs nationaux, notamment sur la 
question des modèles internes et des collèges de supervision. Ils devraient rester 
dans le domaine de compétence des superviseurs nationaux, tandis que le rôle de 
médiation de l’EIOPA est essentiel et devrait être renforcé, en particulier pour ce qui 
concerne les questions transfrontières. Toutefois, cela est incompatible avec le fait 
d’être responsable de la validation des modèles internes nationaux. S’agissant du rôle 
de l’EIOPA dans les cas transfrontières et de ses recommandations aux superviseurs 
nationaux, solution privilégiée par certains États membres, ces échanges pourraient avoir 
lieu sur des plateformes de coordination dédiées. 
7 
 
Outre l’adaptation réglementaire, les défis à relever sont liés aux modifications 
technologiques et environnementales, qui sont des préoccupations nouvelles mais 
néanmoins cruciales pour les assureurs, les régulateurs et les superviseurs. 
Les acteurs de l’assurance, quelles que soient leur taille et leur exposition aux risques, sont 
confrontés à la révolution numérique, qui est inévitable ainsi que le montrent les évolutions 
dans d’autres secteurs d’activité tels que les voyages, le tourisme et la restauration. Pour 
rester compétitifs en termes de relation clientèle, les assureurs devront porter la satisfaction 
du client aux niveaux les plus élevés. Il leur faudra réviser fondamentalement leurs 
procédures, leurs outils et leurs systèmes d’information. Cela suppose également une mise à 
niveau de leurs politiques en matière de ressources humaines. Les risques associés à la 
révolution numérique sont nombreux, mais je voudrais souligner le risque plus grand 
encore lié à la procrastination. Ce risque me semble particulièrement important et il 
constituera une préoccupation essentielle pour les superviseurs. 
La révolution numérique induit d’autres évolutions qui requièrent l’attention du superviseur. 
L’une d’entre elles est l’intégration croissante de produits d’assurance dans des 
offres forfaitaires. C’est notamment le cas des produits d’assurance affinitaires. Ces 
produits impliquent la multiplication des intermédiaires au sein de la chaîne de valeur. Ce 
phénomène est susceptible de brouiller les responsabilités et la valeur économique 
intrinsèque de ces produits, aussi sommes-nous vigilants quant à la protection des 
consommateurs qui est particulièrement importante dans un cadre réglementaire européen 
renforcé s’agissant de la gouvernance des produits (notamment par l’intermédiaire de la 
directive sur la distribution d’assurances).  
Une autre évolution concerne l’accès aux données et leur utilisation. Pour rester 
compétitif en matière de relation clientèle et de gestion des risques, l’accès aux données et 
la capacité à les utiliser efficacement seront essentiels. Ces évolutions impliqueront de 
développer encore la coopération entre les autorités en charge de la protection des données 
personnelles et les autorités de surveillance des assurances. Cette coopération est déjà 
concrétisée par la participation de la CNIL (Commission nationale de l'informatique et des 
libertés) au groupe de travail sur l’intelligence artificielle, animé par l’ACPR, qui publiera un 
rapport dans les prochains mois. J’espère que cette coopération s’approfondira encore dans 
les prochaines années. 
Par conséquent, les données sont plus que jamais un atout stratégique. Dans ces 
circonstances, face aux risques de cybercriminalité, il est impératif de garantir la 
sécurité. 
8 
 
La révolution numérique s’est accompagnée de l’apparition d’attaques informatiques, qui ont 
été de plus en plus médiatisées. Ces cyber-attaques n’épargnent pas le secteur de 
l'assurance, où les systèmes d'information jouent un rôle opérationnel majeur. Les 
assureurs doivent aujourd’hui gérer et se prémunir contre ce risque qui, dans leur 
cas, est accru par la sensibilité des données (médicales, personnelles, financières, 
etc.) gérées et stockées dans leurs systèmes d’information. 
Pour relever ces défis, les autorités publiques ont entrepris un travail important de 
sensibilisation du marché de l’assurance à ce nouveau type de risque opérationnel, les 
systèmes informatiques du secteur de l’assurance étant encore trop vulnérables.  
 
Il incombe en premier lieu au marché de concevoir des dispositifs de sécurité efficaces 
compatibles avec l’ouverture des systèmes d’information et l’innovation. C’est un défi 
immense, mais c’est dans cet état d’esprit que travaille l’ACPR. La cybersécurité reste l’une 
de nos priorités en matière de surveillance pour ces prochaines années et il est important de 
maintenir ou d’engager activement notre dialogue à cet égard, de faciliter l’émergence et la 
diffusion de bonnes pratiques et de renforcer la résilience du secteur de l’assurance.  
Dans cette phase de transition décisive, je voudrais attirer votre attention sur l’étude de 
l’ACPR relative au risque informatique, qui présente les bonnes pratiques en matière de 
risques informatiques et plus précisément de cyber-risque. 
Tandis que la révolution numérique crée de nouveaux risques pour les assureurs qui 
deviennent des cibles, elle offre aussi de nouvelles opportunités de croissance pour le 
secteur consistant à couvrir le cyber-risque de leurs assurés. L’ACPR sera donc 
particulièrement attentive aux évolutions de la cyber-assurance, qui nécessite également 
que les assureurs s’adaptent, gèrent un risque « nouveau » en termes de sélection et de 
souscription, de tarification et de surveillance du portefeuille. 
 
En matière de supervision, la dernière priorité que je voudrais souligner est liée au 
changement climatique. Bien que les pertes résultant de catastrophes naturelles dans le 
monde au premier semestre 2018 soient moitié moindres que celles observées au cours de 
la même période de 2017 
1
, ce n’est pas une bonne nouvelle. Les conséquences à long 
terme du changement climatique demeurent un sujet de préoccupation essentiel pour les 
assureurs, les climatologues prévoyant un accroissement à long terme des catastrophes 
naturelles. Ces modifications affectent les deux côtés du bilan des assureurs, en 
                                                 
1
 Les pertes se sont élevées à 33 milliards de dollars au premier semestre 2018 et à 65 milliards au premier 
semestre 2017. 
9 
 
raison de la hausse des risques physiques et des risques liés à la transition vers une 
économie à faibles émissions de carbone, et des travaux supplémentaires sont 
naturellement nécessaires pour les traiter correctement.  
 
Par exemple, aucune méthodologie commune n’a encore été développée pour évaluer 
correctement l’incidence de l’augmentation attendue de la fréquence des catastrophes 
naturelles. Les expositions des assureurs français ont été estimées s’agissant des risques 
liés à la transition vers une économie à faibles émissions de carbone. Fin 2017, 250 milliards 
d’euros, soit quelque 10 % du portefeuille total des assureurs français, étaient investis dans 
des secteurs définis comme sensibles au risque de transition, ce qui peut être considéré 
comme une exposition importante. Ce chiffre n’est toutefois qu’une ébauche, les définitions 
et les méthodes de mesure de l’empreinte carbone des portefeuilles d’actifs en étant encore 
au stade de l’élaboration.  
 
Ces exemples montrent la reconnaissance encore insuffisante de la nécessité d’agir 
rapidement pour respecter les objectifs de l’accord de Paris en matière de changement 
climatique. Les actions des régulateurs doivent se traduire par des incitations appropriées à 
agir plus rapidement. Pour aller dans ce sens, la Banque de France et l’ACPR ont mis en 
place et animent de façon coordonnée le Réseau des banques centrales et des superviseurs 
pour le verdissement du système financier (NGFS). 
 
Permettez-moi de conclure en ajoutant que les mutuelles sont évidemment exposées à tous 
les défis que j’ai mentionnés. Je suis convaincu qu’elles se tiennent prêtes à les relever et 
qu’elles disposent des moyens de le faire. Au cours de ces dernières années et afin de 
relever de nouveaux défis, le secteur mutualiste, qui comptait historiquement un grand 
nombre d’acteurs, s’est montré capable de s’adapter et a réussi à maintes reprises à 
procéder aux concentrations nécessaires. Il est important que cette adaptabilité soit 
maintenue, et pourquoi pas poursuivie à l’échelle internationale, d’autant plus que les valeurs 
mutualistes sont essentielles pour la stabilité du modèle de l’assurance fondé sur le partage 
des risques.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Vœux de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France, 
à la place financière de Paris 
Paris, 16 janvier 2019 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr).
Page 1 sur 5 
 
Je vous souhaite à toutes et à tous la bienvenue dans cette magnifique 
Galerie dorée qui vient de fêter ses trois cents ans. La relation qui lie la 
Banque de France et l’ACPR aux autres pouvoirs publics et aux acteurs du 
financement de l’économie s’inscrit aussi dans la durée, et joue un rôle 
indispensable en matière de stabilité financière et de protection des 
consommateurs. Ce nombre d’années de travail commun m’invite encore plus, 
au seuil de 2019, à vous présenter nos vœux personnels les plus chaleureux, 
pour vous-mêmes, vos proches, et pour l’ensemble des collaborateurs de vos 
institutions et de vos établissements. 
Un mot d’abord sur la conjoncture économique. Même si elle est moins 
brillante qu’espéré il y a un an, elle reste encore relativement satisfaisante : 
d’après nos enquêtes et malgré le ralentissement lié au mouvement des gilets 
jaunes,  l’activité devrait avoir progressé en France de 1,5 % en 2018. Nous 
prévoyons le même chiffre pour 2019. Nous sommes toutefois attentifs à trois 
ennemis de la croissance – les « 3i » – qui peuvent se nourrir mutuellement à 
l’aube de cette année : les incertitudes, du Brexit à la croissance chinoise ; 
l’impatience qui pèse partout sur les efforts durables des réformes, et 
l’isolationnisme incarné par les postures protectionnistes américaines. L’année 
sera aussi celle, pour notre pays, des élections européennes le 26 mai, 
essentielles pour notre Europe, et de la Présidence française du G7, qui peut 
être une occasion de faire avancer des solutions efficaces au plan 
international.  
Mais ce soir, je voudrais me concentrer sur trois vœux pour le bon 
financement de l’économie : pour l’euro, pour la stabilité financière, et enfin 
pour une finance inclusive. 
1) Mon premier vœu porte sur l’euro qui vient de fêter ses vingt ans. 
 
L’euro est un succès incontestable. L’inflation a été ramenée en moyenne 
annuelle  de 4,9 % – au cours des vingt années précédant l’euro – à 1,7 % – 
au cours des vingt dernières années – ce qui a préservé le pouvoir d’achat 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
des citoyens européens. Les coûts de financement sont nettement plus 
faibles. Notre monnaie est aujourd’hui soutenue par 75 % des citoyens de la 
zone euro, 72 % des Français : c’est le plus haut niveau jamais atteint depuis 
2003.  
La croissance de la zone euro en 2019 – bien qu’en baisse – devrait rester 
supérieure à son potentiel. Dans cet environnement, la normalisation de notre 
politique monétaire – commencée avec l’arrêt réussi de nos achats nets 
d’actifs en décembre – reste souhaitable. Mais elle doit être progressive – 
selon l’ordre de la séquence que nous avons clairement précisé – et 
pragmatique dans le calendrier de mise en œuvre, où nous devons garder 
nos options ouvertes face à l’incertitude. Parallèlement, nous devons enfin 
renforcer notre Union économique, plus encore si un ralentissement se 
profile. Il faut amplifier résolument les progrès de l’accord de décembre : une 
résolution solide et efficace est la clef de l’Union bancaire plus encore que la 
garantie des dépôts, avec un « backstop » pouvant à la fois intervenir 
rapidement et demeurer en place assez longtemps. L’Union des marchés de 
capitaux, sur laquelle tout le monde est en accord de principe, doit enfin 
avancer concrètement pour mieux mobiliser notre excédent d’épargne privée 
de 350 milliards d’euros vers les besoins concrets de notre économie : 
l’innovation digitale, la transition énergétique et les fonds propres des PME. 
Enfin, les progrès sur les mécanismes publics de solidarité – intervention 
préventive du Mécanisme Européen de Stabilité, capacité budgétaire – sont 
une perspective prometteuse mais qui doit se traduire dans les faits. 
2) Mon deuxième vœu concerne la stabilité financière. 
 
Je voudrais d’abord saluer la solidité de nos institutions financières. Le 
ratio de fonds propres de catégorie 1 des principales banques françaises 
s’établit à 13,5 % à juin 2018 soit 7,7 % de plus qu’en 2008. La situation de 
liquidité s’améliore avec un LCR moyen de 127 %. La part des prêts non 
performants continue de diminuer pour s’établir à 3,1 % à juin 2018 – soit 
proche du niveau d’avant-crise – contre 3,6 % en moyenne au niveau 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
européen. Les assureurs ne sont pas en reste. Leur capitalisation est bonne, 
et leur solvabilité s’est renforcée avec une progression de 9 points de 
pourcentage du taux de couverture moyen des grands organismes qui atteint 
désormais 241 %. Les assureurs sont cependant aussi sensibles au risque de 
prolongation des taux bas, et je ne peux qu’inviter avec Bernard Delas à la 
poursuite de la modération en conséquence dans les taux servis sur 
l’assurance-vie. 
Au regard de la stabilité financière, nous devons tirer toutes les conséquences 
du rejet par le Parlement britannique du projet d’accord sur le Brexit. 
L’incertitude politique est forte en Grande-Bretagne : nous pouvons encore 
espérer du meilleur, mais nous devons activement nous préparer au plus 
mauvais scénario qu’est un « No Deal Brexit ».  Je salue les efforts que vous 
avez déployés pour anticiper ces conséquences. La Banque de France et 
l’ACPR, en liaison avec les autorités européennes, prendront d’ici fin mars 
toutes les mesures nécessaires dans le cadre du projet de loi « habilitant le 
Gouvernement à prendre les mesures de préparation au retrait du Royaume-
Uni de l’Union européenne» qui sera réexaminé par le Sénat à partir de 
demain. 
Au-delà du Brexit, chaque secteur a son propre sujet de réglementation : 
Bâle 3 et Solvabilité 2. Pour les banques, l’enjeu essentiel du paquet 
CRR/CRD réside dans la transposition en droit européen de l’accord sur 
Bâle 3 obtenu de haute lutte le 7 décembre 2017, et bien complété lundi à 
Bâle sur les risques de marché. Son application devra tenir compte des 
spécificités européennes – y compris celles des banques françaises – tout en 
maintenant le principe de l’harmonisation maximale, indispensable à 
l’approfondissement de l’Union bancaire. Pour les assurances, l’enjeu de ce 
premier semestre de 2019 est de bien préparer la revue 2020 de 
Solvabilité II.  L’ACPR et Bercy vont coordonner un bilan complet et sans 
tabou afin d’identifier des pistes de réforme : sur la détention d’actions et 
l’investissement à long terme, sur la volatilité excessive, sur des simplifications 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
du cadre prudentiel y compris dans son reporting... Mais ceci suppose une 
implication collective des professionnels – j’y invite ce soir –, et des 
convergences européennes – nous les rechercherons.  
Je reviens sur une innovation 2018, en faveur de la stabilité financière : la 
décision en juin d’introduire un « coussin contracyclique »  bancaire à la 
quotité minimum de 0,25 %. Il ne s’agit pas de freiner le crédit aujourd’hui, 
mais au contraire de constituer des réserves mobilisables face à un 
retournement du cycle demain. La croissance du crédit est effectivement et 
heureusement restée très dynamique depuis juin – à +5,5 % annuels dont 
+6,1 % pour les PME : le Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière en conséquence 
est prêt à relever modérément ce « coussin » dès que nécessaire. 
Mais les nouveaux risques sont technologiques autant que financiers. La 
cybersécurité  doit mobiliser tous les acteurs publics comme privés. Ce sera 
une priorité de la présidence française du G7.  
3) Mon troisième et dernier vœu est pour une finance inclusive. 
 
Le mouvement des gilets jaunes a mêlé des violences inacceptables – y 
compris contre des agences bancaires ou d’assurances – et des 
revendications fortes de plus grande justice économique et sociale. Dans ce 
contexte, je sais pouvoir compter sur les banques françaises pour le respect 
strict de leurs engagements pris auprès du Président de la République le 
11 décembre sur  le plafonnement des frais bancaires à 25 euros 
mensuels pour les 3,5 millions de clients fragiles. Je précise qu’ils 
s’appliquent maintenant – au plus tard dès février – et que nous les 
contrôlerons précisément au long de l’année. L’ACPR a fait du respect de cet 
engagement un thème prioritaire de ses contrôles sur place et sur pièces en 
2019. L’Observatoire de l’inclusion bancaire, que je préside, avec participation 
des associations de consommateurs et d’insertion sociale, suivra les chiffres 
et prendra toute mesure nécessaire. L’OIB veillera aussi au respect des 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
engagements pris sur la diffusion parmi ces clients fragiles de l’offre 
spécifique, et son plafonnement à un niveau plus bas (20€/mois et 200€/an).  
 
2019 marquera aussi les 30 ans de la loi Neiertz : nous nous félicitons de la 
diminution du flux de personnes nouvellement surendettées dont le nombre 
est enfin revenu à celui de 1989 puisqu’il s’établit en 2018 à 90 000 « primo-
demandes », contre 140 000 cinq avant ! 
 
Plus nouvelle mais très prometteuse est notre mobilisation pour la finance 
verte. L’ACPR publiera au premier trimestre 2019 les résultats de son enquête 
sur la gestion du risque climatique par les banques et sociétés d’assurance. 
Le réseau global des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le 
verdissement du système financier (NGFS), lancé par la Banque de France 
début 2018, est un très beau succès : lancé avec huit participants, il en 
compte désormais 24 sur cinq continents. Son premier rapport – qui sera 
présenté lors d’une conférence à Paris le 17 avril prochain – permettra de 
nouvelles propositions pour l’action. 
 
Je voudrais terminer par quelques mots sur la Banque de France. Notre 
institution est fortement engagée pour améliorer sa performance. En 2018, la 
Banque de France a ainsi réduit de 8 % ses dépenses nettes d’activité par 
rapport à 2015, soit un gain de 100 MEUR par an pour les contribuables. Et 
nous innovons dans nos services : le Lab, la première blockchain de place 
Madré, ou le succès rencontré par la dématérialisation de notre procédure 
d’agrément de l’ACPR, effective depuis novembre 2018. Dans ces temps plus 
chahutés, notre première responsabilité est de tenir fermement nos caps sur 
nos missions au service de l’économie française, comme sur notre 
transformation. Vous pouvez y compter : Bonne année à vous tous et à notre 
pays !

ESSEC – Centre d’excellence 
Paris, mardi 29 janvier 2019 
 
Intervention de Denis Beau – Premier sous-gouverneur  
 
Les enjeux de réglementation et de surveillance financières liés à 
l’impact des entreprises technologiques sur les services financiers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
Chers étudiants, 
 
C’est un plaisir d’être au Centre d’excellence de l’ESSEC aujourd’hui pour parler des 
enjeux de réglementation et de surveillance financières liés à l’impact des entreprises 
technologiques sur les services financiers.  
 
En Europe, nous avons été habitués jusqu’à présent à un modèle d’intermédiation 
centré sur les banques. Mais, au cours des dix dernières années, nous avons 
également été témoins du développement des start-ups du secteur de la Fintech  
et de l’entrée des Bigtechs dans la sphère financière. Qu’apportent ces entités de 
nouveau au fonctionnement du système financier ? D’après certains commentateurs, 
elles devraient entraîner le remplacement de l’intermédiation financière centrée sur 
les banques qui caractérisait l’« ancien monde », par des systèmes désintermédiés 
entre pairs (peer-to-peer). Pour d’autres, ces nouveaux arrivants, si on leur laisse  
le champ libre, seront plus probablement à l’origine de nouveaux modèles dans 
lesquels Fintechs et Bigtechs seront de nouveaux intermédiaires des banques. 
 
Je vais d’abord préciser l’impact possible de ces nouveaux concurrents sur le modèle 
d’intermédiation financière traditionnel centré sur les banques (1). Je soulignerai 
ensuite certains risques qui vont de pair avec les changements en cours ainsi que les 
défis qu’ils créent aux plans réglementaire et prudentiel (2). Enfin, j’expliquerai 
comment, à la Banque de France, nous abordons ces défis en vue d’établir un juste 
équilibre entre deux objectifs : d’une part,  promouvoir l’innovation et l’efficience 
globale des services financiers et, d’autre part, garantir un environnement sûr et une 
égalité de traitement pour l’ensemble des fournisseurs de services financiers et leurs 
clients (3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 
 
1. Des Fintechs aux Bigtechs : dix années de digitalisation de la chaîne de 
valeur de l’intermédiation financière 
 
Comprendre comment le secteur des Fintechs est apparu et s’est structuré (A) est 
essentiel pour évaluer son impact sur l’avenir de l’intermédiation (B).  
 
(A) Le concept de Fintech, contraction de Financial Technology (technologie 
financière), désigne à la fois un changement structurel – la digitalisation de la finance 
– et les principaux acteurs de ce changement eux-mêmes, c’est-à-dire les 
entreprises technologiques.  
 
La digitalisation de la finance prospère sur le terreau des technologies de pointe.  
La combinaison du big data, du cloud computing, de l’intelligence artificielle et de la 
technologie blockchain transforment la façon dont les produits financiers sont 
conçus, produits et distribués. Pour ses partisans, cette transformation est  
la promesse de meilleures expériences utilisateur, d’un financement plus diversifié  
de l’économie, et d’une plus grande efficience du système financier. 
 
Au-delà de ces promesses, les technologies de pointe abaissent les barrières  
à l’entrée du secteur financier pour ceux qui les ont adoptées en premier, les 
entreprises technologiques. Cela n’est pas surprenant : internet et les smartphones 
ont réduit les coûts de distribution, les technologies de big data ont réduit les coûts 
de production et la réduction des bilans bancaires dans le sillage de la Grande crise 
financière a permis à de nouveaux acteurs de conquérir des parts de marché. 
 
Les services de paiement, qui pèsent peu sur les bilans financiers, ont été jusqu’à 
présent la principale voie d’entrée dans le secteur financier pour les entreprises 
technologiques. Du paiement, celles-ci peuvent ensuite remonter la chaîne de valeur, 
en s’attaquant à l’activité de banque de détail et commerciale, à la gestion de 
patrimoine et à l’assurance.  
 
Le modèle des entreprises technologiques se fonde sur la dissociation des activités 
de la banque universelle traditionnelle en une série de fonctions essentielles 
distinctes, telles que l’acheminement des paiements, la fourniture de financements, 
 
4 
 
le partage des risques et la répartition des capitaux, qui sont réassemblées sur une 
plateforme en ligne. Dans ce modèle, le contrôle de la plateforme est plus 
stratégique que l’offre de services financiers elle-même.  
 
(B) Parmi ces entreprises technologiques, les start-ups du secteur de la Fintech 
(également appelés plus simplement les « Fintechs » avec un « s ») et les Bigtechs 
auront probablement un impact différent sur l’intermédiation financière.  
 
Les start-ups du secteur de la Fintech ont déjà changé la donne dans le secteur 
financier. Elles ont importé dans le secteur financier la culture d’internet, centrée sur 
l’utilisateur et ont ciblé et remis en question un grand nombre de rentes financières. 
Cependant, les start-ups du secteur de la Fintech n’ont pas les ressources en capital 
suffisantes pour « perturber » les acteurs en place et leur rôle futur devrait être 
déterminé par l’alternative suivante  :  coopérer voire passer le contrôle d’un acteur 
établi ou entrer en concurrence sur des segments de niche, tel que le financement 
participatif ou l’activité de prêt en ligne. 
 
La situation s’annonce toute autre avec les Bigtechs. La capitalisation boursière des 
GAFA – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple – est 25 fois supérieure à celle de 
l’ensemble des Fintechs. Les Bigtechs disposent déjà d’une présence significative 
dans les services financiers, notamment dans les services de paiement : Amazon 
Pay est présente dans 10 pays, Google Pay dans 22 pays et Apple Pay dans 
25 pays. Facebook Messenger intègre, parmi ses fonctionnalités, les paiements 
entre pairs dans trois pays et un portefeuille électronique serait déjà en préparation.  
En outre, des Bigtechs comme les GAFA disposent d’avantages compétitifs pour 
étendre leurs activités dans les services financiers, notamment des ressources 
financières massives, une forte image de marque, une clientèle constituée à l’échelle 
mondiale et un accès privilégié aux technologies de pointe. 
 
En conséquence, les Bigtechs, plus encore que les Fintechs, disposent des 
capacités nécessaires pour remodeler significativement l’intermédiation financière, 
en intégrant l’ensemble des services financiers au sein de leur propre écosystème 
digital. Cela ne signifie pas que les banques seront nécessairement évincées, mais 
 
5 
 
qu’elles pourraient être interfacées par les plateformes des Bigtechs. Cette évolution 
est par exemple déjà bien engagée en Chine. 
 
La finance digitale portée par les entreprises technologiques ne reposera pas 
nécessairement sur un système plus décentralisé. En effet, la force centripète des 
effets de réseau favorise en premier lieu les grands conglomérats. Au lieu d’éliminer 
l’intermédiation, la finance digitale, si on lui laisse le champ libre, conduira plus 
probablement à rebattre les cartes de l’intermédiation financière. D’abord, en  faisant 
émerger une nouvelle hiérarchie où domineront les acteurs traditionnels les plus 
agiles sur le plan numérique et les nouveaux entrants ayant les plus fortes capacités 
financières. Ensuite, en diversifiant les modes de financement de l’économie autour 
de quatre grands modèles d’intermédiation :  
 
<U+F0B7> Le modèle traditionnel d’intermédiation bancaire, notamment pour les prêts 
immobiliers ; 
<U+F0B7> Un modèle d’intermédiation financière non bancaire (anciennement dénommé 
« shadow banking ») mis en œuvre par le secteur de la gestion d’actifs, 
notamment pour financer le secteur des entreprises ; 
<U+F0B7> Un modèle ré-intermédié, dans lequel Fintechs et Bigtechs jouent le rôle 
d’intermédiaire pour les banques, vis-à-vis de la clientèle de détail en 
particulier ; 
<U+F0B7> Et un modèle intégralement désintermédié reposant sur la technologie 
blockchain et les plateformes de pair à pair. 
 
 
2. La révolution digitale oblige les autorités publiques chargées de la stabilité 
financière à réexaminer un large éventail de questions de régulation et de 
supervision  
 
Ce passage d’un modèle d’intermédiation quasi unique et centré sur les banques à  
un ensemble de modèles plus divers impliquant de nouveaux acteurs n’élimine pas 
pour autant la nécessité de disposer de banques centrales, de régulateurs et de 
superviseurs. Mais cela nous force à nous reposer d’anciennes questions (A) et à en 
examiner de nouvelles (B). 
 
6 
 
 
(A) Parmi les anciennes questions, je souhaiterais en évoquer deux en particulier.  
 
D’abord, la question du périmètre de la réglementation financière. Prenons 
l’exemple du cloud public dont l’utilisation tend à se généraliser pour l’exécution des 
opérations bancaires. Les Fintechs et les Bigtechs ont adopté une stratégie radicale 
dans laquelle les systèmes informatiques reposent intégralement sur le cloud public, 
c’est-à-dire sans hébergement en propre de data centers. Les acteurs en place 
migrent également vers le cloud public, avec plus de prudence cependant. Or, le 
marché du cloud computing est fortement concentré et Amazon Web Services a su 
bâtir une position dominante. À mesure que les fonctions financières essentielles 
basculeront vers le cloud, le risque d’un point unique de défaillance se fera plus 
prégnant. Or à ce jour, les fournisseurs de cloud ne sont pas réglementés en tant qu’ 
infrastructures essentielles et demeurent hors de portée des superviseurs financiers. 
De fait, la réglementation prévoit que les intermédiaires financiers sont seuls 
responsables de l’usage des données confiées à des tiers et le superviseur vérifie 
que les clauses contractuelles reliant les intermédiaires et les tiers permettent un 
contrôle effectif des premiers sur les seconds. Mais l’évolution du rapport de forces 
en faveur des Bigtechs comme fournisseurs dominants du cloud public pourrait, à 
terme, jeter le doute sur l’équilibre de cette chaîne de responsabilité, pourtant 
efficace jusqu’à présent.  
 
Ensuite, les questions liées à la protection du consommateur et à l’éthique. 
Notre réglementation fixe le curseur entre les pratiques acceptables et celles qui ne 
le sont pas. Les évolutions technologiques rendent possible l’utilisation 
d’informations qui étaient auparavant inaccessibles ou inutilisées par les 
intermédiaires financiers. Cet enrichissement en données pourrait potentiellement 
permettre une évaluation plus précise du risque ou une tarification plus « réactive » 
des services. Mais l’horizon des possibles peut ne pas être (socialement) 
acceptable : par exemple, le développement actuel de système de notation du risque 
de crédit recourant aux données issues des réseaux sociaux soulève des questions 
relative à la gouvernance et au contrôle des risques des intermédiaires financiers, 
lorsque des questions de vie privée ou de biais discriminatoire sont en jeu.  
 
 
7 
 
(B) J’en viens maintenant aux nouveaux risques, non financiers par nature mais qui 
sont étroitement liés à la digitalisation de la finance. Deux de ces risques, 
notamment, méritent un examen approfondi de la part des superviseurs financiers. 
  
Premièrement, l’indépendance stratégique des acteurs en place. Si les banques 
ou les assureurs dépendent des Bigtechs pour l’accès à une infrastructure 
essentielle comme le cloud computing, s’ils s’appuient sur ces mêmes Bigtechs pour 
distribuer leurs produits sur leurs plateformes et si dans le même temps ils sont 
concurrencés par les Bigtechs sur d’autres segments de services financiers, ils 
s’exposent à la remise en cause de leur indépendance stratégique, comme ce fut le 
cas pour les hôtels et le commerce de détail. Un tel processus pourrait conduire à 
une pression accrue sur les marges des acteurs traditionnels et à une plus grande 
volatilité de leur clientèle avec deux effets potentiels pour la stabilité financière : une 
prise de risque accrue sur les conditions d’octroi de crédit et une dépendance plus 
forte des banques à un refinancement de marché. 
 
Deuxièmement, la question des cyber-risques. Face aux interconnexions 
croissantes entre technologies et système financier et à l’heure de l’« open data » et 
de l’ouverture des systèmes d’information, la Banque de France a fait le constat dans 
son évaluation des risques pour le système financier français de décembre 2017 que 
les cyber-risques  devenaient une source potentielle de risque systémique à laquelle 
il fallait remédier. Cette prise de conscience est largement partagée entre acteurs  
publics et privés, et il n’est pas surprenant que la cyber-sécurité soit l’une des 
priorités de la présidence française du G7 cette année.  
 
L’achèvement des accords de Bâle 3 met un terme à une décennie d’effort 
réglementaire et la page de la crise financière de 2008 peut être tournée.  Mais ce 
n’est pas pour autant la fin de l’histoire. Les mutations de l’intermédiation financière 
sont pleines de promesses mais elles mettent également en évidence les limites des 
réglementations sectorielles fondées sur la forme juridique des entités plutôt que sur 
la substance de leurs activités. 
 
Cela me conduit au dernier volet de mon intervention. 
 
 
8 
 
3. L’approche de la Banque de France vis-à-vis des mutations de 
l’intermédiation financière consiste à exploiter les opportunités offertes par 
la Fintech tout en préservant les filets de sécurité financière et l’égalité de 
traitement des acteurs. 
 
(A) La maîtrise des risques pesant sur la stabilité financière liés à un modèle 
d’intermédiation financière plus diversifié doit s’appuyer sur la promotion de principes 
robustes et des liens resserrés entre réglementation financière et non financière. À 
cet égard, la position de la Banque de France se décline en trois volets :  
 
- Premièrement, une réglementation et une supervision articulant mieux la 
surveillance microprudentielle et macroprudentielle, la protection des 
consommateurs, la lutte contre le blanchiment des capitaux, la protection des 
données personnelles et les règles de concurrence ; 
 
- Deuxièmement, une neutralité de principe vis-à-vis de la technologie, qui 
consiste à lever les obstacles injustifiés à l’innovation mais sans traitement de 
faveur, afin de préserver la stabilité financière. À cet égard, trouver le bon 
équilibre implique un esprit d’ouverture et une compréhension approfondie de 
l’innovation. C’est pour cette raison que nous avons créé, en 2016, un pôle 
FinTech Innovation à l’ACPR afin de nouer un dialogue avec les porteurs de 
projets innovants : environ 400 d’entre eux ont pris contact avec nous par le biais 
de ce canal qui leur est dédié ; 
 
- Troisièmement, une réglementation et une supervision fondées sur l’activité 
afin de garantir une égalité de traitement entre toutes les entités exerçant la 
même activité financière, indépendamment de leur forme juridique. La 
multiplication actuelle des catégories d’agrément pour refléter la diversification 
des modèles d’activité entraîne un risque de perte de lisibilité de la 
réglementation et d’arbitrage réglementaire auquel il convient de remédier. 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
(B) Bien entendu, les implications pour la stabilité financière de la transformation de 
l’intermédiation financière ne se limitent pas à la France et ces défis, par nature 
transfrontières, appellent aussi des réponses européennes et globales. Pour cela, il 
faut rechercher une articulation harmonieuse entre initiatives nationales,  
convergence européenne et coopération internationale. 
 
Pour saisir les opportunités et remédier aux risques liés à des technologies 
financières en forte évolution, il y a de nombreuses initiatives sont lancées au niveau 
national. Le cas du financement participatif en constitue un bon exemple. En 2014, la 
France a été pionnière en créant un nouveau dispositif sur mesure pour les 
plateformes de financement participatif et de prêt en ligne (marketplace lending). Ce 
nouveau dispositif a ouvert un espace d’activité pour les nouveaux acteurs tout en 
limitant de manière proportionnée au risque la charge réglementaire et en renforçant 
la protection des consommateurs et des investisseurs. En conséquence, même si le 
financement participatif ne remplacera pas l’activité de prêt classique à court terme, 
le marché français est aujourd’hui, pour la quatrième année consécutive, le plus 
grand marché d’Europe continentale pour les financements alternatifs 
1
. Les derniers 
chiffres pour 2018, publiés par KPMG et Financement Participatif France (FPF) 
2
, 
montrent que plus de 33 000 projets, pour un montant total de 402 millions d’euros, 
ont été financés par des plateformes de financement participatif. Le montant total 
financé a augmenté de 20 % par rapport à 2016 et a été multiplié par 2,4 au cours 
des trois dernières années. 
 
Dans le prolongement des initiatives nationales, la convergence européenne est 
toujours le but ultime. Les initiatives nationales présentent l’avantage de pouvoir être 
mises en œuvre et testées rapidement. Le processus de décision européen n’est 
certes pas réputé pour sa rapidité. Mais la taille du marché européen est essentielle 
pour permettre à nos start-ups du secteur de la Fintech d’atteindre l’échelle 
appropriée pour leurs activités. C’est la raison pour laquelle la Banque de France

prône une réglementation européenne des plateformes de financement participatif 
fondée sur le modèle français.  
 
Toutefois, dans la mesure où les technologies de pointe s’appuient sur la toile 
mondiale (World Wide Web), les banques centrales, les superviseurs et les 
régulateurs auront tôt ou tard besoin de coopérer à l’échelle internationale afin de 
s’assurer que leurs pouvoirs demeurent effectifs. Prenons l’exemple des crypto-
actifs. Aujourd’hui, tout le monde en France peut miser son argent sur le Bitcoin et 
d’autres supports de même nature (mais réfléchissez à deux fois avant de le faire !). 
Cependant, aucune des dix principales plateformes de négociation n’est située en 
France. C’est dans ce contexte qu’en février 2018, le gouverneur de la Banque de 
France, le ministre français de l’Économie Bruno Le Maire, ainsi que leurs 
homologues allemands, ont demandé que cette question soit traitée au niveau du 
G20. Grâce à cette initiative, une surveillance des risques que les crypto-actifs font 
peser sur la stabilité financière est désormais en place au niveau international et de 
nombreuses initiatives sont prises par les organismes internationaux afin de traiter 
les questions les plus urgentes telles que la lutte contre le blanchiment des capitaux, 
l’intégrité des marchés financiers et la protection des consommateurs. 
 
(C) Enfin, les technologies financières ne doivent pas être considérées du seul point 
de vue de l’offre de nouveaux produits ou des risques pour la stabilité financière. Ces 
technologies peuvent également être un atout pour améliorer le respect de la 
réglementation ou les pratiques en matière de gestion des risques : c’est ce que 
nous appelons la « Regtech ». Elles peuvent également aider le superviseur à 
exercer ses missions de manière plus efficace : on parle alors de « Suptech » 
(technologie au service de la supervision). 
 
Dans ces deux domaines, les perspectives sont prometteuses. Pensez aux gains 
d’efficacité potentiels pour un superviseur s’il pouvait tirer parti du big data et de 
l’intelligence artificielle pour, par exemple, analyser l’énorme quantité de données 
quantitatives et qualitatives qui lui sont déclarées régulièrement ainsi que les signaux 
faibles collectés sur le marché. Ou bien s’il pouvait transformer ses outils de suivi 
rétrospectifs en processus prédictifs. 
 
11 
 
Bien sûr, les superviseurs n’en sont qu’au début de la courbe d’apprentissage et il 
est clair qu’ils seront confrontés à plusieurs défis : faire face aux risques inhérents 
aux projets innovants, comprendre les capacités et les limites des nouvelles 
technologies, développer une culture des données moderne dans le domaine de la 
supervision, recruter des personnes ayant des qualifications nouvelles et rares.  
Ces défis doivent être surmontés car les enjeux sont d’importance. Ce n’est pas 
seulement une question d’efficacité. Il en va également de la crédibilité de la 
surveillance prudentielle. Comment un superviseur peut-il être en mesure de 
superviser les risques liés aux nouvelles technologies s’il n’a pas une expérience 
approfondie de celles-ci ? À l’inverse, un superviseur qui sait saisir les opportunités 
des Suptech donne un signal clair et positif aux acteurs du marché : il montre qu’il est 
désireux d’accompagner un secteur en pleine évolution et que les méthodes de 
surveillance prudentielle resteront adaptées et pertinentes, au bénéfice d’un système 
financier sûr et fiable. C’est clairement le chemin que nous voulons emprunter à la 
Banque de France et à l’ACPR. 
 
Je souhaiterais conclure mon intervention en citant Bill Gates : « Nous surestimons 
toujours les changements qui se produiront au cours des deux prochaines années et 
nous sous-estimons ceux qui interviendront dans les dix ans à venir. Ne vous 
complaisez pas dans l’inaction » 
3
. 
 
La Banque de France s’efforce de tenir compte de cet avertissement. Même si nous 
appartenons à l’« ancien monde » – la Banque de France a été créée il y a plus de 
deux cents ans par Napoléon – comme tout acteur traditionnel, nous devons nous 
adapter au « nouveau monde ». Pour y parvenir, nous avons adapté notre 
organisation et notre gouvernance avec la création d’un pôle Fintech au sein de 
l’ACPR, les nominations d’un directeur de la transformation digitale (Chief Digital 
Officer) et d’un directeur des données numériques (Chief Data Officer) et le 
lancement d’un Laboratoire pour encourager l’innovation au sein de la Banque. Nous 
expérimentons les nouvelles technologies : la Banque de France a été la première 
banque centrale à réaliser un projet complet reposant sur les registres distribués 
(blockchain) qui est totalement opérationnel 
4
 et nous avons mené à bien huit projets

d’intelligence artificielle. Nous initions et animons des échanges nourris entre les 
régulateurs, les chercheurs et l’industrie : par exemple, le groupe de travail de 
l’ACPR sur l’usage de l’intelligence artificielle dans le secteur financier a produit un 
rapport en décembre dernier qui sert de support à une période de consultation de 
deux mois (s’achevant le 28 février).  
 
Mais cet appel à l’action s’adresse à tout le monde, et en particulier à vous, la 
nouvelle génération. En tant qu’étudiants de l’ESSEC Business School et futurs 
économistes, banquiers, créateurs de start-ups et chercheurs, vous aurez un rôle 
important à jouer afin de garantir qu’aux milieux des flots  de changements à venir 
dans l’intermédiation financière, notre boussole continue d’être orientée vers le bien 
commun que constitue la stabilité financière. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un réel plaisir pour moi d’être avec vous à Lisbonne – Cidade da Luz e 
Rainha do Mar [ville de lumière et reine de la mer] – le premier pont entre 
l’Europe et l’Asie grâce à l’audace de vos descobridores [explorateurs]. 
Aujourd’hui encore, grâce à ses réformes courageuses, votre pays est un 
exemple inspirant de reprise économique. Je remercie chaleureusement mon 
ami et collègue, Monsieur le Gouverneur Carlos Costa, pour son invitation. 
Avant de parler des défis pour 2019, je commencerai mon intervention sur une 
note plus positive, cette même année marquant le 20
e
 anniversaire de l’euro, 
dont je vais évoquer le succès. 
**  
I. Le succès de l’euro s’est construit sur trois piliers plus indispensables 
que jamais 
Que l’euro soit un succès, peu d’entre nous aujourd’hui en doutent. Il est plus 
intéressant de revenir sur les raisons mêmes de ce succès, construit à mes 
yeux sur trois piliers originels : le mandat de l’Eurosystème qui est la stabilité 
des prix ; le moyen au service de ce mandat, à savoir l’indépendance ; et 
l’esprit guidant son action : l’intérêt général européen.  
A. Le mandat : la stabilité des prix 
L’Eurosystème a un mandat très clair qui lui a été confié par les Traités 
européens
ii
 : son principal objectif consiste à « maintenir la stabilité des prix », 
c’est-à-dire éviter des périodes prolongées d’inflation excessive – celles des 
après-guerres allemandes – ou de déflation – celle de l’après crise de 1929 –
qui ont toujours des effets négatifs sur l’économie. Certains observateurs 
préconisent encore un « double mandat » qui viserait à la fois l’inflation et la 
croissance ou le plein emploi, comme par exemple celui de la Réserve 
fédérale. Mais cela aurait été hors de portée politique au regard de 
l’expérience traumatisante de certains pays européens en matière d’inflation. 
Par ailleurs, je voudrais rappeler deux éléments :  
Page 2 de 10 
 
- la stabilité des prix doit être maintenue « à moyen terme ». Comme le 
souligne notamment F. Smets, il existe une « équivalence entre la longueur 
de l’horizon de politique monétaire et le poids sur la stabilisation de l’écart 
de production » 
iii
 et, donc, sur l’emploi. 
- comme énoncé dans le Traité, « sans préjudice de l’objectif de stabilité des 
prix », l’Eurosystème soutient « les politiques économiques générales de 
l’Union ».  
Permettez-moi d’ajouter que, plus le mandat est précis et ciblé, plus forte peut 
et doit être l’accountability (« rendu-compte ») des résultats de la BCE. Or, les 
défenseurs d’un mandat plus large sont aussi souvent ceux qui critiquent le 
plus l’insuffisante accountability de la BCE, au prix donc d’une réelle 
incohérence. 
Dès 1998, la BCE a donné une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix, 
qu’elle a précisée en 2003 : maintenir le taux d’inflation à un niveau inférieur à 
mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme. D’autres grandes banques centrales, 
comme la Fed et la Banque du Japon – en 2012 et 2013 respectivement –, ont 
suivi la BCE et adopté également la même cible de 2 % pour l’inflation. C’est 
une remarquable «convergence conceptuelle
iv
 ». 
Au regard de notre mandat, les résultats sont tangibles [slide 1]. Au cours des 
vingt années qui ont précédé l’introduction de l’euro (1979-1998), l’inflation 
s’est établie à 4,9 % en moyenne en zone euro, contre seulement 1,7 % au 
cours des vingt dernières années. Ensuite, une meilleure maîtrise de l’inflation 
signifie un coût du financement plus faible, car elle réduit les primes de 
risque : les différentiels de taux d’intérêt et les écarts entre les pays (spreads) 
ont ainsi nettement baissé [slide 2]. Le spread entre la France et l’Allemagne 
est passé de 1,9 % en moyenne sur la période 1986-1993 – celle du marché 
unique sans la monnaie unique, entre l’Acte unique européen et Maastricht –, 
à 0,4 % sur la période 2017-2019. Le spread entre le Portugal et l’Allemagne a 
baissé de 5,5 points de pourcentage au cours de la même période.  
Page 3 de 10 
 
Par ailleurs, sur le plan de la croissance [slide 3], et contrairement à une 
perception erronée assez répandue, le PIB par habitant de la zone euro a 
progressé presque aussi rapidement que celui des États-Unis depuis 
l’introduction de l’euro. Il a augmenté de 1,1 % par an en moyenne entre 1999 
et 2017, contre 1,2 % aux États-Unis ; l’écart ne s’est creusé que 
temporairement durant la crise européenne de 2011-2012.  
B. Le moyen : l’indépendance 
Comme nous le savons tous, de nombreux travaux universitaires, confortés 
par les résultats empiriques, plaident fortement en faveur de l’indépendance 
des banques centrales depuis la « Grande inflation » des années 1970
v
. Pour 
autant, l’indépendance reste contestée dans nos démocraties. Des deux côtés 
de l’Atlantique, les gouvernements aujourd’hui les plus critiques de 
l’indépendance sont ceux-là mêmes qui en démontrent le plus la nécessité : 
leurs politiques budgétaires non soutenables, s’il n’y avait l’ancre d’une 
Banque centrale crédible, menaceraient en effet la stabilité des prix. 
L’indépendance ne sert pas à protéger les banquiers centraux ; elle sert 
à protéger les citoyens et la confiance collective dans la monnaie. 
Pourtant, l’indépendance ne vaut qu’au regard d’un mandat précis – la 
stabilité des prix – et en conséquence d’une accountability forte des 
résultats (« rendu-compte »), devant les citoyens et leurs représentants : 
chaque année, le président de la BCE est auditionné à quatre reprises par le 
Parlement européen et donne huit longues conférences de presse (contre 
quatre pour la Fed jusqu’en 2018). La BCE doit parallèlement écouter de plus 
en plus les acteurs économiques et sociaux.  
Au-delà du droit, l’indépendance s’ancre par les hommes qui l’incarnent : 
successivement depuis 20 ans, Wim Duisenberg, Jean-Claude Trichet et 
aujourd’hui Mario Draghi. Je parlerais volontiers de triple indépendance : par 
rapport aux gouvernements nationaux bien sûr, mais aussi par rapport au 
court-termisme des médias ou des marchés financiers, et enfin par rapport 
aux camps bien établis (faucons ou colombes) ou aux écoles académiques, 
même si chacun d’eux avait un solide bagage économique. Ils ont donc su 
Page 4 de 10 
 
innover avec pragmatisme : quand Jean-Claude Trichet traite le risque de 
liquidité bancaire avec le Fixed Rate Full Allotment en 2008, ou décide les 
premiers achats de titres avec le programme SMP en 2010 ; et, bien sûr, 
quand Mario Draghi prononce son désormais célèbre  « Whatever it takes » 
en juillet 2012 ou amplifie les instruments non conventionnels à partir de 2014.  
C. L’esprit : l’intérêt général européen 
Ces trois hommes ont aussi porté l’esprit européen, par leur culture et leurs 
convictions. Loin d’être une construction technocratique, l’euro a en effet été 
au départ un projet politique : voulu, entre autres, par Helmut Kohl, 
Jacques Delors et François Mitterrand en parallèle à la réunification allemande 
[slide 4]. Et il est soutenu aujourd’hui par 75 % des citoyens de la zone 
euro, le plus haut niveau depuis 2003, et même 77 % des Portugais et 81 % 
des Allemands. Ce soutien populaire constitue notre plus grand succès et 
notre plus grand atout. Et il prouve que l’Europe est populaire dès qu’elle 
cesse d’être abstraite, pour s’incarner dans des projets concrets.  
Mais depuis vingt ans, la zone euro a essentiellement progressé dans les 
crises : la création du Mécanisme européen de Stabilité pour aider les États 
membres en 2012, apportant un soutien, entre autres, au Portugal ; ou l’Union 
bancaire en 2014, en réponse aux crises espagnole ou irlandaise. Alors que la 
dernière crise financière s’éloigne, l’intérêt général européen s’est affaibli 
aujourd’hui. C’est très grave : en 2017 et 2018, alors que l’on pouvait 
considérer que le cycle économique était au beau fixe, nous, Européens, 
n’avons pas su réparer le toit. Et ceci m’amène aux défis pour 2019.  
 
II. Nos défis face aux incertitudes de 2019  
A. Un ralentissement et non une récession 
Un mot tout d’abord sur la conjoncture économique. À l’échelle mondiale, 
l’activité décélère nettement, mais nous ne nous dirigeons pas vers une 
récession. Selon le FMI, la croissance mondiale pourrait s’établir à 3,5 % 
Page 5 de 10 
 
en 2019, après 3,7 % en 2018. La principale explication à ce ralentissement 
est la hausse de l’incertitude générale en raison des risques géopolitiques, à 
commencer, au niveau mondial, par les tensions commerciales provoquées 
par l’Administration américaine et en Europe par la perspective d’un Brexit dur, 
très dommageable mais malheureusement de moins en moins improbable. 
L’incertitude affecte la confiance des chefs d’entreprise et peut impacter 
l’investissement en favorisant un comportement attentiste [slide 5] 
vi
. Par 
exemple, en France, les anticipations des entreprises du secteur 
manufacturier relatives aux perspectives économiques globales ont 
commencé à baisser plus tôt et plus fortement que leurs anticipations 
concernant leur propre production. Et aux États-Unis, on observe une 
divergence entre des données d’enquêtes plus faibles, comme l’indice ISM du 
secteur manufacturier, et des données solides toujours en hausse sur la 
production industrielle. Par conséquent, restaurer la confiance devrait être la 
priorité. La responsabilité en incombe aux dirigeants politiques : le meilleur 
antidote au ralentissement actuel est la réduction des risques géopolitiques, 
plutôt qu’une modification des politiques économiques.  
L’économie française ralentit, mais de façon moins marquée que dans 
d’autres pays européens, en raison de la hausse du pouvoir d’achat et d’une 
demande intérieure robuste. En 2019, la croissance de la France devrait être 
supérieure à celle de l’Allemagne et proche de la moyenne de la zone euro. 
Au-delà de la demande intérieure, le deuxième pilier de la capacité de 
résistance européenne devrait être l’intensification des réformes nationales. 
J’aimerais prendre ici l’exemple de la reprise portugaise depuis 2014, après 
une crise sévère et de courageux efforts d’ajustement : le PIB augmente 
désormais de 2,1 % en 2018. Des réformes ambitieuses ont amélioré la 
compétitivité-coût, dopé les performances à l’exportation et entraîné une forte 
baisse du taux de chômage, qui a diminué de plus de moitié depuis 2013. Ceci 
illustre parfaitement qu’en Europe, les réformes fonctionnent.  
B. Notre politique monétaire est capable de conjuguer clarté et 
flexibilité 
Page 6 de 10 
 
Permettez-moi d’en venir aux conséquences en termes de politique monétaire: 
pour faire face à l’incertitude, nous devons conjuguer clarté et flexibilité, 
comme nous l’avons fait en décembre pour nos indications en chaîne relatives 
aux taux directeurs (chained guidance). J’y reviendrai. Dans le contexte 
actuel, nous devons favoriser une analyse dépendant de la situation (state-
dependent) plutôt que des variables temporelles (time-dependent). En d’autres 
termes, nous devrons suivre très attentivement les données économiques au 
cours des prochains trimestres et en particulier évaluer dans quelle mesure le 
récent ralentissement de la croissance et la baisse actuelle de l’inflation sont 
des phénomènes de nature temporaire ou plus structurelle : 
- s’agissant de la croissance, le ralentissement en cours dans la zone euro 
résulte en partie de facteurs temporaires, tels que des disruptions à 
l’origine d’une contraction de la production manufacturière allemande et 
l’impact du mouvement des gilets jaunes en France. Si ces obstacles 
disparaissent, et si les risques géopolitiques s’estompent, la croissance du 
PIB pourrait rebondir à partir du printemps ou de l’été prochain. La 
consommation reste en effet solide et continue d’être soutenue par 
l’accélération de la hausse des salaires, en particulier dans les grands 
pays. Mais si un ralentissement de l’activité devait perdurer au-delà de cet 
horizon - un scénario moins plausible, mais que l’on ne peut exclure – nous 
serions prêts à adapter nos indications en matière de politique monétaire. 
- concernant l’inflation, l’effet à la baisse du fléchissement des prix du 
pétrole sera important en 2019. Après avoir culminé à 2,2 % en 
octobre 2018, l’inflation totale de la zone euro s’établit actuellement à 1,4 % 
et reviendra à 1 % environ dans quelques mois. Au-delà de ces variations 
temporaires, l’enchaînement clé que nous devons surveiller concerne 
l’inflation sous-jacente (core price inflation). L’amélioration du marché du 
travail a déjà donné lieu à une accélération substantielle de l’inflation 
salariale. Celle-ci ne s’est toutefois pas encore transmise à l’inflation 
sous-jacente. Même si nous enregistrons des signes précoces 
d’accélération des prix – comme pour la composante services de l’IPCH, 
Page 7 de 10 
 
à 1,6 %
vii
 en janvier selon les estimations –, nous observons un 
affaiblissement de la répercussion des hausses de salaires sur les prix : là 
aussi, s’agit-il d’un phénomène temporaire dû à un décalage temporel plus 
prononcé ou d’une évolution attribuable à des facteurs plus structurels ? 
Nous devons soigneusement examiner cette question, qui fait également 
débat aux États-Unis. 
Dans ce contexte, je continue de penser que la normalisation progressive de 
notre politique monétaire est souhaitable. Nos indications en chaîne relatives 
aux taux directeurs de décembre dernier ont été moins remarquées que le 
succès de la fin de nos achats nets d’actifs. Mais elles sont efficaces pour 
conjuguer clarté en termes de séquence – les réinvestissements intégraux se 
poursuivront sur une période prolongée après un premier relèvement de taux 
– et flexibilité en termes de calendrier pour chaque étape. En conséquence, 
les marchés financiers tendent à adapter leurs prévisions de calendrier – et 
donc leurs conditions de financement – à la perception qu’ils ont de la 
situation : nos indications en chaîne relatives aux taux directeurs assurent déjà 
une certaine fonction de stabilisation, sans préjudice de nos décisions futures.  
Outre la flexibilité en termes de calendrier, je voudrais souligner une autre 
qualité de notre politique monétaire : le pragmatisme de son intensité, grâce 
au puissant « trio » d’instruments dont nous disposons : les réinvestissements 
d’actifs, les taux d’intérêt et la liquidité.  
S’agissant de ce troisième instrument (la fourniture de liquidité), tout le monde 
est conscient de l’expiration prochaine du programme TLTRO 2, qui 
interviendra en juin 2020. Le Conseil des gouverneurs se prononcera sur ce 
sujet en temps voulu, à deux conditions. Comme Mario Draghi l’a souligné, « il 
faut de bons arguments de politique monétaire » 
viii
 pour l’ensemble de la zone 
euro : notre politique ne peut être conçue en fonction des besoins spécifiques 
de certaines banques ou certaines juridictions. Deuxièmement, nous devons 
examiner la gamme complète des instruments possibles, y compris diverses 
formes de LTRO, pour décider du recalibrage des conditions et des maturités. 
Page 8 de 10 
 
S’agissant des taux d’intérêt, j’ai souvent souligné dans le passé l’utilité mais 
également les limites évidentes des taux négatifs. Comme je l’ai dit dès 2017 : 
« ils sont difficiles à faire accepter par les ménages et les PME et donc, en 
pratique, il est impossible de les répercuter sur eux 
ix
 ». De ce fait, beaucoup 
pensent que s’ils sont maintenus trop longtemps, ils pèseront négativement 
sur la rentabilité de l’intermédiation financière et seront susceptibles de nuire à 
la bonne transmission de la politique monétaire. Par conséquent, si nous 
devions utiliser des taux négatifs durant une période plus longue, nous 
devrons examiner de façon pragmatique comment atténuer les effets négatifs 
qu’ils seraient susceptibles d’exercer sur la transmission de notre politique 
monétaire. 
C. Plaider inlassablement pour un renforcement européen 
Permettez-moi de revenir à l’esprit européen en faveur duquel j’ai déjà plaidé. 
Aujourd’hui, il s’agit aussi d’une nécessité économique : face au 
ralentissement de l’activité et aux incertitudes, la politique monétaire ne peut 
pas tout faire à elle seule. C’est une préoccupation allemande, qu’avec 
beaucoup d’autres, je partage pleinement. Nous devons donc plaider 
inlassablement pour un renforcement de notre Union économique. 
L’engagement de Mario Centeno, en tant que président de l’Eurogroupe, est 
essentiel. Les progrès réalisés par le Conseil européen en décembre 2018 
vont dans la bonne direction mais doivent clairement être renforcés et 
poursuivis.  
Le succès de l’Union bancaire dépendra de la mise en œuvre d’un 
mécanisme de résolution solide, – sans doute même plus que d’un système 
complet et commun de garantie des dépôts. Concernant le filet de sécurité du 
Fonds de Résolution Unique, des considérations de stabilité financière doivent 
nous conduire à envisager une durée plus longue pour les lignes de crédit. Et 
nous ne parviendrons pas à mettre en place une Union bancaire efficace et 
bénéfique sans consolidation transfrontière en Europe : il existe encore trop 
d’obstacles et trop peu de restructurations transfrontières. L’accord 
de décembre dernier ne fait malheureusement quasiment pas progresser 
Page 9 de 10 
 
l’Union des marchés de capitaux. Passons enfin du consensus de principe, 
dans les mots, aux avancées concrètes, notamment sur l’harmonisation des 
régimes de faillite et le renforcement de l’ESMA. L’Union bancaire et l’Union 
des marchés de capitaux sont les composantes clé d’une véritable « Union de 
financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » : j’ai proposé cette idée 
pour mieux mobiliser nos abondantes ressources – notre excédent d’épargne 
privée de 340 milliards d’euros – pour les besoins concrets de l’économie 
européenne : la transition énergétique, les fonds propres des PME, ou encore 
l’innovation numérique. 
Mais le renforcement de la zone euro devra également inclure des 
mécanismes publics de solidarité. Concernant le MES, il ne doit pas 
seulement s’agir de gérer les crises ex-post, mais de les prévenir ex-ante, 
surtout par le renforcement de nos instruments de précaution. Il faut éviter 
qu’une sévérité excessive des critères ex-ante n’empêche en pratique le 
recours préventif au MES. Ces mesures doivent également être complétées 
par une capacité budgétaire commune : ces termes sont probablement moins 
sujets à controverse qu’un « budget » commun, mais comme le président de 
la BCE l’a écrit la semaine dernière, nous ne devons pas nous éloigner de sa 
fonction de stabilisation. Dans ce cas, elle soutiendrait la politique monétaire 
unique et la stabilité des prix.  
** 
Je conclurai en citant le Président Mário Soares, l’un des acteurs clés de 
l’accession du Portugal à la Communauté européenne : « l’histoire récente a 
montré que, plutôt que de céder devant les crises, nous devons les affronter, 
avec la détermination de les surmonter 
x
 ». C’est avec ce même esprit 
combatif que nous devons affronter les défis de 2019 : le Brexit et les élections 
européennes ainsi que des élections nationales au Portugal et maintenant, en 
Espagne. Notre rôle comme banque centrale est d’être fidèle à notre mandat 
en toute indépendance. Mais nous devons également être plus attentifs que 
jamais à notre environnement : être prêts à réagir en réponse aux incertitudes

Premier sous-gouverneur 
 
 
Zone euro et défis monétaires et financiers à relever : quelles options ?  
 
 
  
2/12 
 
Dix ans après la crise, la capacité du système financier mondial, et en particulier celle du 
secteur financier européen, à résister aux chocs apparaît significativement renforcée. 
Ce renforcement est le fruit de nombreux changements de nature variée : 
Les banques ont davantage de fonds propres, qui sont en outre de meilleure qualité. Leur 
activité en matière de transformation est mieux encadrée et leurs coussins de liquidité sont 
plus importants.  
En Europe, le renforcement de la résilience du secteur bancaire est aussi passé par des 
évolutions institutionnelles majeures avec la création du mécanisme de supervision unique 
sous l’égide de la BCE, et du mécanisme de résolution unique. 
Au-delà du secteur bancaire, les réformes conduites sous l’impulsion du G20 ont aussi 
permis de renforcer le fonctionnement des marchés financiers (notamment celui des 
marchés de dérivés), de mieux suivre et encadrer les développements de l’intermédiation 
financière non bancaire (le shadow banking), et de développer un cadre d’analyse et de 
régulation de la stabilité du système financier dans son ensemble avec la mise en œuvre de 
politiques macroprudentielles. 
Enfin, la crise a suscité des changements de fonctionnement au sein des organisations 
financières. De manière très visible, les filières risques et conformité, sont devenues des 
composantes essentielles des organisations. De manière plus subtile, on peut observer des 
évolutions dans la culture des organisations, avec un accent davantage mis sur leur bonne 
gouvernance et le « sens » de certaines activités ou sur le « service » rendu au client. 
Ce renforcement de la résilience du système financier est un facteur de confiance important, 
dans un environnement marqué en ce début d’année 2019 par la montée des incertitudes 
géopolitiques et une décélération de la croissance. Mais l’heure ne doit pas être à la 
complaisance. Prévenir et limiter l’impact de possibles nouveaux chocs demeurent au cœur 
des défis à relever, notamment pour la zone euro. 
Vous m’avez invité, Madame la Vice doyenne, à présenter ma perspective de banquier 
central et de superviseur sur les options qui s’offrent aux acteurs privés et publics pour 
relever ces défis. Plutôt que des options je voudrais souligner deux « ardentes » obligations 
qui me paraissent devoir s’imposer à tous : 
- Pour les intermédiaires financiers et leurs superviseurs micro et macroprudentiels, le 
maintien d’une forte vigilance (I.) ; 
- Pour les régulateurs et les acteurs privés du financement de nos économies, le 
renforcement de l’intégration financière de la Zone Euro (II.). 
 
3/12 
 
I. Le maintien d’une forte vigilance est nécessaire pour naviguer dans un monde 
plus incertain 
a. Des menaces persistent 
Avec en toile de fond une forte incertitude géopolitique et un environnement macroéconomique 
moins favorable qu’anticipé, le secteur financier doit faire face à une combinaison de risques 
très « classiques » mais aussi de risques relativement inédits. 
Depuis l’été dernier, des surprises négatives se sont accumulées : très fort regain des 
tensions commerciales entre les États-Unis et leurs partenaires, notamment la Chine, 
tension autour du budget italien, rejet par le Parlement britannique de l’accord de sortie du 
Royaume-Uni de l’Union européenne – et, plus proche de nous, l’ampleur et la durée du 
mouvement des « gilets jaunes ». 
Ce climat a pesé sur l’environnement macroéconomique, qui est sans conteste un peu moins 
porteur qu’on ne l’anticipait il y a quelques mois. Selon le FMI, la croissance mondiale 
pourrait s’établir à 3,5 % en 2019, après 3,7 % en 2018. La croissance de l’économie 
française ralentit également, mais de façon moins marquée que dans d’autres pays 
européens, en raison de la hausse du pouvoir d’achat et d’une demande intérieure robuste. 
En 2019, la croissance de la France devrait être supérieure à celle de l’Allemagne et proche 
de la moyenne de la zone euro. 
Ce contexte incertain donne un relief plus prononcé aux risques auxquels font face les 
intermédiaires financiers. 
En effet, l’endettement des acteurs économiques est toujours élevé. C’est en particulier le 
cas en France où il n’a cessé d’augmenter depuis une quinzaine d’années pour atteindre 
respectivement près de 75 % et 60 % du PIB pour les sociétés non financières et les 
ménages, en contraste net avec les développements observés chez nos partenaires 
européens et dans les autres économies avancées. Aussi, une révision à la baisse des 
perspectives de croissance pose-t-elle avec plus d’acuité la question de la soutenabilité de 
cet endettement et de son rôle d’amplificateur en cas de choc à la hausse sur les taux 
d’intérêt ou à la baisse sur l’activité. 
Dans le même ordre d’idées, ce contexte rend plus difficile l’assainissement (toujours aussi 
nécessaire) des bilans de ceux des intermédiaires financiers qui n’ont pas pu ou ont tardé à 
le faire après la dernière crise et en portent encore les stigmates en termes de créances 
douteuses.  
Cet environnement macroéconomique et géopolitique plus incertain pèse aussi sur des 
marchés dont la valorisation apparaît encore élevée si on l’apprécie dans une perspective de 
4/12 
 
moyen terme. Les prix des actifs financiers sont ainsi exposés à un risque de corrections 
fortes et brutales, d’autant que, depuis la grande crise financière, la liquidité des marchés 
semble plus fragile. 
Enfin, de manière plus prospective, la révision à la baisse des anticipations de croissance 
pourrait prolonger l’environnement de taux d’intérêt bas qui, bien qu’il soit globalement 
cohérent avec la situation macroéconomique, n’est pas sans conséquence sur la dynamique 
d’endettement des agents d’une part, la profitabilité des intermédiaires financiers d’autre 
part. 
À ces risques cycliques bien identifiés viennent s’en ajouter d’autres, nouveaux et plus 
structurels. C’est en particulier le cas des risques qui émergent dans le contexte de la 
digitalisation du secteur financier. 
La digitalisation de la finance est portée par une combinaison de technologies de pointe (big 
data, cloud computing, intelligence artificielle ou encore la technologie blockchain) qui 
transforment la façon dont les produits financiers sont conçus, produits, distribués et gérés. 
Cette transformation est la promesse de meilleures expériences utilisateur, d’un financement 
plus diversifié de l’économie, de coûts de production plus faibles et d’une plus grande 
efficience du système financier.  
Mais la digitalisation s’accompagne de trois types de risques. 
D’abord, cette transformation passe par des investissements importants, la conduite de 
projets complexes et une plus grande agilité des institutions. À ce titre, plus que d’autres 
évolutions, la nécessaire et souhaitable transformation digitale des intermédiaires financiers 
est porteuse d’un risque d’exécution – c’est un premier type de risque, très idiosyncratique, 
mais qu’il faut aussi reconnaître. 
Ensuite, la digitalisation est un vecteur de remise en question des business models établis et 
de leur profitabilité, aux effets potentiellement déstabilisants dans un marché bancaire 
européen en surcapacité et où la rentabilité des banques est certes en progrès mais 
demeure nettement en retrait par rapport à celle de leurs concurrentes américaines.  
Enfin, troisième type de risque, la digitalisation donne une dimension systémique au risque 
opérationnel. Dans un monde largement dématérialisé où l’accès aux services financiers est 
multicanal, l’importance du risque cyber croît tandis que le recours par l’ensemble des 
intermédiaires financiers, et leur dépendance opérationnelle à un petit nombre de 
fournisseurs de solutions technologiques « complètes », et plus seulement de logiciels, pose 
la question de l’impact d’une discontinuité du service non plus à l’échelle d’un acteur mais du 
système dans son ensemble. 
5/12 
 
b. Quelles sont les priorités pour les superviseurs microprudentiels ? 
Ces risques complexes, interdépendants et pour une partie significative nouveaux doivent 
inciter les intermédiaires financiers et leurs superviseurs à la vigilance pour bien en 
comprendre la nature et les effets et pour mettre en œuvre les moyens appropriés pour bien 
les cantonner et les gérer. Pour le MSU, cette vigilance a conduit pour 2019 aux trois 
priorités de supervision suivantes : 
- première priorité : suivre le risque de crédit porté par le secteur bancaire de la Zone 
Euro, compte tenu des encours toujours élevés de prêts non-performants en 
prolongeant l’action incitative forte qui a déjà permis d’engager une substantielle 
réduction ; 
- deuxième priorité : s’assurer de la gestion adéquate des risques par les 
établissements y compris dans les aspects de comportement, comme la protection de 
la clientèle et la lutte  contre le blanchiment, dont on a pu mesurer  l’importance ces 
dernières années   ; 
- troisième priorité : maîtriser les risques multidimensionnels, au premier rang 
desquels, le Brexit. La priorité du SSM à ce sujet a été clairement de s’assurer que 
les banques de la Zone Euro actives au Royaume-Uni et celles établies au Royaume-
Uni et actives en Zone Euro ont bien mis en œuvre les plans de contingence rendus 
nécessaires par la perte du passeport européen qu’induira le Brexit. 
c. Quel rôle pour la politique macroprudentielle ? 
À côté de l’approche microprudentielle, la politique macroprudentielle a un rôle 
complémentaire à jouer dans une logique plus préventive et avec une perspective 
embrassant le système financier dans son ensemble. 
La politique macroprudentielle a un rôle préventif à jouer face à la dynamique de 
l’endettement et du cycle financier : la phase actuelle du cycle financier est propice à une 
prise de risque accrue que l’autorité macroprudentielle, le Haut Conseil de stabilité 
financière, HCSF, en France, peut chercher à limiter et/ou dont elle peut vouloir prévenir les 
conséquences en cas de choc financier. 
Ainsi, le HCSF suit avec attention les marchés ou les activités où pourrait se développer une 
certaine exubérance. Il a par le passé signalé sa sensibilité au marché de l’immobilier 
commercial (c’est-à-dire l’immobilier comme classe d’actifs pour les investisseurs financiers), 
à la dynamique d’endettement des grandes entreprises très endettées ou, plus récemment, 
aux activités de leverage finance (typiquement, la dette d’entreprises engagées dans des 
opérations de LBO, souvent cédée par les originateurs à d’autres investisseurs). 
6/12 
 
Au-delà d’une surveillance attentive de ces marchés, le HCSF a déjà été conduit à intervenir 
formellement pour limiter la prise de risque : il a ainsi décidé fin 2017 d’abaisser à 5 % de 
leurs fonds propres les expositions des principales banques aux grandes entreprises les plus 
endettées. 
Dans le but de prévenir les conséquences de la prise de risque accrue en cas de choc 
financier, le HCSF a aussi décidé, en juin 2018, de relever le taux du coussin de fonds 
propres contracyclique à 0,25 %, c’est-à-dire de demander aux banques davantage de fonds 
propres au regard de leurs expositions françaises. 
En lien avec sa nature contracyclique, ce coussin de fonds propres est mis en place de 
façon préventive, au moment où le crédit est peu contraint et où le « coût » pour l’économie 
de la mise en place de cette exigence supplémentaire est limité.  
Il permet de constituer des marges de manœuvre pouvant être utilisées pour prévenir un 
rationnement du crédit qui résulterait de pertes plus importantes qu’anticipées suite à un 
choc ou au retournement du cycle financier. Son relâchement immédiat permet alors aux 
banques de mobiliser cette réserve de capital pour maintenir leur offre de crédit, notamment 
aux petites et moyennes entreprises qui sont les plus dépendantes du financement bancaire. 
La politique macroprudentielle s’intéresse aussi aux risques structurels émergents évoqués 
précédemment. 
Par exemple, la « plateformisation » des activités financières induite par la digitalisation 
contribue à un mouvement de fond de transformation de l’intermédiation financière auquel 
participent aussi d’autres facteurs : recherche de rendement suscité par un environnement 
de taux bas, évolution des business models des intermédiaires financiers en réaction à 
l’environnement macro-financier comme aux évolutions règlementaires, souhait des 
entreprises de diversifier leurs sources de financement pour renforcer leur résilience. 
En termes de stabilité financière et de risque systémique, ces évolutions se traduisent par un 
rôle croissant de l’intermédiation non bancaire dans le financement de l’économie alors 
même que la politique macroprudentielle est principalement définie en référence à un 
modèle de financement bancaire.  
Cette évolution de l’intermédiation financière se traduit aussi par des interconnexions plus 
nombreuses et plus complexes entre les différentes parties du secteur financier (banques, 
fonds d’investissement, assureurs). 
Dans les deux cas, les autorités macroprudentielles doivent renforcer leur capacité 
d’analyse, notamment pour mieux comprendre les conséquences de ces interconnexions et, 
à terme, être capable de mener des stress tests à l’échelle du système et pas simplement 
7/12 
 
des différents secteurs et faire évoluer la conduite de leur politique macroprudentielle pour 
mieux appréhender ces nouvelles dimensions. 
Le HCSF s’est résolument engagé dans cette voie : il a vu ses pouvoirs ajustés par le 
législateur en 2016 pour lui permettre d’intervenir au-delà du secteur bancaire,  
il a commencé à conduire des stress tests coordonnés communs à l’ensemble des secteurs, 
il a contribué à la mise en commun des données dont dispose l’ensemble des autorités pour 
appréhender le système et ses interconnexions de manière plus systématique, etc. 
Si les autorités nationales doivent être en première ligne dans la conduite de la politique 
macroprudentielle, force est de constater que ces efforts ne peuvent pas être conduits de 
manière isolée, en particulier au sein de l’Union européenne et de la Zone Euro où nos 
économies et leur financement sont étroitement imbriqués. 
 
II. Le renforcement de l’intégration financière de la zone euro doit être poursuivi 
Structurellement très intégrés au plan économique, les pays de la Zone Euro ne peuvent pas 
rester « au milieu du gué » en matière d’intégration financière. Le renforcement de cette 
intégration ne se fera pas spontanément mais appelle une action politique forte et 
déterminée. Il passe par l’achèvement de l’Union bancaire, complété par un plan d’action qui 
permette le développement d’autres canaux de financement et la constitution en Europe de 
marchés financiers plus développés, plus profonds et mieux intégrés. 
a. Pourquoi renforcer l’intégration financière de la Zone Euro ? 
On a coutume de dire que l’euro, qui vient de fêter ses vingt ans, est un projet éminemment 
politique. À l’évidence, il l’est : la monnaie unique est un des marqueurs quotidiens d’une 
identité européenne partagée. Comme d’autres « succès européens », la libre circulation des 
personnes par exemple, on oublie souvent qu’il n’allait pas forcement de soi. 
Mais l’euro est aussi une nécessité économique : il est né, en partie, des inconvénients, 
devenus évidents dans les années 1980 et 1990, à faire vivre des économies associées 
dans un marché unique avec des monnaies nationales : l’union économique appelait l’union 
monétaire. 
De même, la crise financière de 2007-2009 puis la crise des dettes souveraines de la Zone 
Euro (2011-2012) ont clairement mis en évidence les inconvénients d’une union économique 
et monétaire qui ne soit pas aussi une union bancaire et financière. 
En effet, l’intégration imparfaite au plan financier s’est traduite, pendant la crise, par 
l’apparition d’une fragmentation des conditions de financement au sein de la Zone Euro, qui a 
8/12 
 
contribué à amplifier le choc de la crise. La solvabilité des gouvernements et des banques de 
certains pays s’est dégradée brusquement, entraînant un cercle vicieux lié au biais 
domestique, c’est-à-dire à la surexposition des banques à la dette émise par le 
gouvernement de leur pays. 
Aujourd’hui, des progrès ont été faits pour résoudre les sources institutionnelles de cette 
fragmentation, en matière de surveillance et de coordination des politiques budgétaires, de 
mise en place d’une supervision financière plus homogène. Cependant, l’intégration 
financière de la Zone Euro reste un enjeu fort dont dépend la prospérité future de l’Union 
européenne et de ses citoyens. Depuis la crise, l’allocation de l’épargne et de 
l’investissement demeure fortement orientée vers des marchés et supports domestiques. 
Des progrès à réaliser dans ce domaine dépendent la capacité à mettre une épargne 
abondante au service de l’investissement, en particulier du financement des entreprises 
européennes, notamment les plus innovantes et les plus dynamiques dont le développement 
détermine notre trajectoire de croissance potentielle. 
De cette intégration dépend aussi la stabilité économique et financière de l’Union 
européenne qui doit pouvoir s’appuyer sur une capacité privée d’absorption des chocs 
économiques et un meilleur partage des risques. 
Plus fondamentalement encore, de cette intégration dépend notre capacité à tirer pleinement 
et durablement les bénéfices du rapprochement qui a été engagé en 1957, à assurer que la 
« communauté européenne » soit davantage qu’une addition et que l’Europe pèse vraiment 
dans le monde de demain.

b. Améliorer le fonctionnement de l’Union bancaire… 
L’un des jalons essentiels de cette intégration a été l’Union bancaire. Cependant, il convient 
d’en adapter et d’en améliorer le fonctionnement. 
L’incarnation la plus visible de l’Union bancaire a été la mise en place d’une supervision 
unique sous l’égide de la BCE.  
Édifié en un temps record en réponse aux principaux maux qui affectaient notre système 
bancaire, liens étroits entre dette bancaire et dette publique, hétérogénéité des droits 
bancaires nationaux, biais national dans la supervision, le Mécanisme de supervision unique 
(MSU) est aujourd’hui une réalité tangible, qui a profondément transformé l’encadrement du 
secteur bancaire dans la Zone Euro. 
Après à peine plus de 4 ans d’existence, le MSU constitue aujourd’hui un modèle original et 
efficace, fondé sur l’application du Single Rule Book de l’UE (sous la direction de l’Autorité 
bancaire européenne, ABE) et une coopération étroite entre la BCE et les autorités 
nationales à tous les niveaux (Conseil de surveillance prudentielle, Joint Supervisory Teams, 
équipes de contrôle sur place) et un principe de subsidiarité et de proportionnalité (la BCE 
exerce ainsi la supervision directe des 119 plus grands groupes bancaires, les autorités 
nationales celle de toutes les autres entités). 
L’avancée institutionnelle que représente le MSU est tout à fait significative et ses premiers 
résultats réels. 
Les pratiques de supervision bancaire ont été harmonisées vers le haut et sont aujourd’hui à 
la pointe des standards internationaux (par exemple, la méthodologie d’évaluation du profil 
de risque des établissements / SREP). 
Le secteur bancaire européen est nettement plus solide qu’avant la crise : le ratio de 
solvabilité en fonds propres de base (CET1) des grands établissements a augmenté de plus 
de 3 points depuis 2014 (passant de 11,3 % à 14,6 % à la fin 2017) et leur bilan a été 
largement assaini (diminution du taux de créances douteuses de 7,6 % à 4,9 % sur la même 
période). 
La résilience du secteur a été confirmée par les stress tests organisés par l’EBA et la BCE 
en 2018, simulant l’impact de chocs financiers sur la solvabilité des plus grands 
établissements : en scénario adverse, le ratio de solvabilité CET1 moyen de l’échantillon 
s’établirait à 9,9 % – soit un point de plus que lors de l’exercice réalisé en 2016. 
Cependant, nous n’avons pas encore bénéficié de tous les « dividendes » d’une régulation 
plus homogène et d’une supervision plus intégrée et nous devons veiller à consolider les 
progrès initiaux et à les prolonger. 
10/12 
 
D’un point de vue règlementaire, au-delà de l’intégration dans le corpus européen des 
derniers accords de Bâle (paquet CRR 2 – CRD 5 introduisant notamment de nouvelles 
exigences prudentielles – NSFR, ratio de levier, etc.), il nous faut encore progresser dans 
l’application d’une réglementation uniforme, et tirer toutes les conséquences de l’intégration 
bancaire au niveau de la Zone Euro en supprimant les obstacles règlementaires en termes 
de capital, de liquidité ou de grands risques aux opérations transfrontalières comme en 
ajustant le calcul des exigences pour les établissements systémiques. Il s’agit dans tous ces 
cas de reconnaître que la zone euro doit être traitée comme une juridiction unique pour 
l’application de la réglementation unique.  
En termes de supervision, il s’agit désormais d’intégrer dans le champ du mécanisme  de 
supervision unique les entreprises d’investissement (EI) les plus importantes  et de renforcer 
la coopération entre les autorités nationales pour le suivi des établissements transfrontaliers 
(relations home-host) ou en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment et contre le financement du 
terrorisme dont l’importance nous est régulièrement rappelée par l’actualité. 
Pour parachever l’Union bancaire, il nous faut aussi rendre son deuxième pilier, le 
Mécanisme de résolution unique, MRU, pleinement opérationnel. 
Depuis 2015, la Zone Euro est dotée d’un mécanisme commun de résolution des crises 
bancaires. Également fondé sur un cadre réglementaire commun (directive BRRD, 
règlement MRU), le MRU s’articule à l’instar du MSU autour d’un Conseil de résolution 
unique et d’équipes de résolution conjointes. 
Si le MSU et le MRU ont su gérer leurs premiers cas de liquidation ou résolution (banques 
vénètes, Banco Popular), le deuxième pilier reste à finaliser. Celui-ci est essentiel, 
notamment pour prévenir la contagion des crises bancaires et assurer la continuité des 
fonctions critiques assurées par les banques. 
La France a milité dans cette perspective pour la mise en œuvre d’un filet de sécurité 
commun (common backstop) dont les grandes caractéristiques sont depuis quelques mois 
arrêtées. Trois questions restent toutefois en suspens : la durée du financement de ce filet 
de sécurité, la création d’un processus de décision rapide en cas d’urgence, la fourniture de 
liquidités aux banques en résolution. 
Une fois ces questions réglées, on peut espérer, et c’est notre conviction à la Banque de 
France, qu’un compromis pragmatique sur le troisième pilier – la garantie des dépôts, pourra 
être trouvé. 
11/12 
 
c. … et construire l’Union des marchés de capitaux pour développer une véritable 
Union de financement 
À l’évidence, l’intégration financière ne se résume pas à une intégration bancaire. Le 
financement équilibré et soutenable d’une économie passe aussi par les marchés, ce qui 
favorise une diversification géographique de l’utilisation de l’épargne et qui répond aux 
besoins de financement, notamment en fonds propres des entreprises. Il passe également 
par une meilleure mobilisation de l’épargne confiée aux organismes d’assurance et aux 
fonds de pension pour le financement à long terme de l’économie européenne, et c’est 
pourquoi la France soutient une revue ambitieuse de cette réglementation sectorielle.  C’est 
au regard de ces objectifs globaux de mobilisation de l’épargne que le projet d’Union de 
marché de capitaux (UMC) proposé par la Commission européenne en 2015 fait l’objet d’un 
très large soutien. 
La Commission a d’ores et déjà mis en œuvre un grand nombre de mesures (révision de la 
directive Prospectus, création de fonds de capital-risque et de fonds de long terme 
européens – EuVECA et ELTIF) et la discussion est bien engagée sur d’autres sujets (label 
paneuropéen d’épargne retraite individuelle (PEPP), plan pour la finance durable, plan sur 
les FinTechs). 
Et il est évidemment essentiel que la future Commission, le futur Parlement européen et le 
Conseil se saisissent de ce plan d’action et mènent à leur terme les travaux règlementaires. 
Mais l’intégration financière passe aussi par les initiatives des acteurs économiques et 
financiers qui doivent se saisir du cadre réglementaire pour le faire vivre : le développement 
de marchés tels que ceux des green bonds, de la dette privée ou de la titrisation ne se 
réalisent que grâce aux les émetteurs, aux investisseurs et aux arrangeurs qui les animent. 
Plus fondamentalement, l’Union des marchés de capitaux n’a de sens que si, avec l’Union 
bancaire et d’autres projets comme InvestEU (le plan Juncker), elle s’inscrit dans la 
perspective plus large d’une Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation. 
L’intégration financière de la Zone Euro est donc une nécessité et doit être une dimension 
cardinale des différents projets qui touchent au financement des économies européennes. 
Mais, comme tous les projets qui impliquent une véritable transformation, elle n’avancera 
qu’en bénéficiant de l’engagement fort de tous les acteurs : législateurs et régulateurs, 
autorités européennes et nationales, acteurs publics et privés.

Nous sommes à quelques semaines des prochaines élections européennes. 
Souligner les menaces auxquelles nous faisons face, c’est l’occasion de se rappeler que, 
dans un monde globalisé où la taille est un facteur clé, notre souveraineté exercée en 
commun fait notre force. 
Et évoquer « l’ardente obligation » d’une meilleure intégration financière en Europe, c’est se 
rappeler des succès, réels mais parfois oubliés, de la construction européenne comme du 
coût et des dangers que représente une intégration inachevée et illustrer, une fois de plus, 
que l’Europe est un projet qui peut se faire au bénéfice de tous mais qui ne se fera pas sans 
l’engagement sincère et déterminé de chacun.

Les Rencontres du financement de l’économie 
 Paris - 26 mars 2019 
 
 
Intervention de Denis Beau, 
 Premier sous-gouverneur 
 
 
Opportunités et risques d’un financement de l’économie en mutation 
 
 
  
2/7 
 
Mesdames, messieurs, je suis très heureux d’introduire ces 6èmes rencontres du financement 
de l’économie. En toile de fond  à vos échanges je voudrais concentrer mes remarques sur 
les mutations en cours du financement de l’économie française et européenne et les 
opportunités et les risques qui les accompagnent, du point de vue d’une banque centrale,  
la Banque de France, et d’un superviseur, l’ACPR, chargés de veiller à la stabilité de notre 
système financier et de contribuer ainsi à un financement résilient aux chocs et sain de la 
croissance. Trois raisons confèrent une forte actualité à cette préoccupation d’un 
financement de la croissance solide et efficace : 
- les risques qui pèsent à la baisse sur les perspectives d’expansion de la zone euro se sont 
amplifiés au cours des derniers mois,  
- la révolution numérique a commencé à se déployer largement  au sein de nos économies, 
source d’opportunités et de gains mais aussi de menaces pour ceux qui ne sauraient pas 
s’adapter, 
- l’importance du crédit bancaire qui en France, représente [Planche 1] 60 %  
de l’endettement des entreprises. Les 40 % restants proviennent de financements de marché 
qui sont l’apanage des seules grandes entreprises. Cette situation n'est pas propre à la 
France. Elle est assez générale en Europe en opposition avec celle qui prévaut aux États-
Unis.  
D’ores et déjà, plusieurs facteurs, comme la recherche de rendement suscité par un 
environnement de taux d’intérêt bas, les nouvelles contraintes règlementaires qui pèsent sur 
le système bancaire, et la digitalisation, modifient la façon dont les financements sont 
conçus, produits, distribués et gérés. Cette transformation conduit à une structure de 
financement de nos économies plus diversifiée. Cette diversification est-elle 
opportune ? Cette diversification est-elle suffisante ? 
 
I. Une diversification opportune des financements pour accélérer la croissance et 
l’innovation, qui doit continuer à être soutenue 
 
Ma réponse à la première question est oui, car une trop forte dépendance au financement 
bancaire peut constituer pour le développement des entreprises une source de vulnérabilité 
en cas de choc affectant le système bancaire.  Le rythme assez lent de développement de 
cette diversification montre toutefois qu’elle n’est pas si simple à réaliser, et qu’il 
convient de continuer à l’encourager.  
3/7 
 
A.  À court terme, il convient de poursuivre les efforts d’adaptation du cadre 
réglementaire et de standardisation des financements alternatifs au crédit bancaire 
déjà engagés 
Pour soutenir le développement de financements alternatifs au crédit bancaire un effort 
significatif d’adaptation du cadre réglementaire a été mené par les autorités publiques au 
cours des dernières années. Cet effort doit être poursuivi et accompagné par les acteurs 
privés d’un effort parallèle de standardisation du marché. 
Ainsi, depuis 2017, l’Union européenne dispose de nouvelles règles permettant le 
développement d’une titrisation saine, c’est-à-dire simple, transparente et standardisée pour 
libérer le bilan des banques et favoriser ainsi l’émission de nouveaux prêts, tout en offrant 
une exposition sur les marchés obligataires à des emprunteurs qui n’y ont généralement pas 
accès, telles les PME. Le potentiel de développement est significatif : dans la zone euro,  
les émissions d’ABS et de MBS sur le marché sont aujourd’hui trois fois moindre qu’elles ne 
l’étaient qu’avant la crise de 20081. 
D’autres actions concernent des supports d’investissement qui permettent aux entreprises 
de bénéficier de ressources provenant d’investisseurs prêts à prendre davantage de risques. 
Par exemple, les placements privés en euro (EuroPP), dotés depuis 2015 d’une charte, 
constituent désormais une offre complémentaire à celles des USPP aux États-Unis et des 
Schuldscheine en Allemagne. Les montants émis par des sociétés françaises ont atteint 2,28 
milliards d’euros en 20182, mais sont en recul depuis le pic de 2015 (4,3 milliards d’euros), 
faute d’offrir des conditions de taux suffisamment attractives. Il importe donc que les 
professionnels de la Place poursuivent leur effort de promotion de ce type de placement et 
accentuent leurs actions en faveur d’une standardisation du marché. 
En revanche, le développement des plateformes de financement participatif (crowdfunding), 
bien que modeste est bien orienté en France, même si le modèle économique de ces 
plateformes n’a pas encore trouvé son point d’équilibre, avec + 20 % de fonds collectés en 
2018, à 402 millions d’euros3, et un nombre croissant de projets financés. Ce développement 
a bénéficié du cadre réglementaire du financement participatif mis en place en 2014 et 
actualisé en 2016. Ce cadre français devrait encore s’assouplir avec la Loi PACTE. À terme 
un projet de règlement européen en cours de négociation pourrait partiellement substituer au 
cadre français un statut européen harmonisé et favoriser ainsi le développement des 
opérations transfrontières.

4/7 
 
Quant aux Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), qui permettent aux start-up de lever des fonds en 
crypto-actifs très rapidement, leurs flux en France sont encore embryonnaires (71,7 millions 
d'euros durant les trois premiers trimestres de 2018, soit 0,5 % du total mondial) mais sont 
en plein essor (4 fois plus qu’en 2017) 4. Le cadre législatif, en préparation, offrira des 
repères précieux aux investisseurs, et sera susceptible de renforcer leur confiance dans les 
mécanismes associés aux crypto-actifs et donc d’en favoriser le développement. 
 
B. À plus long terme, l’objectif doit être le renforcement des fonds propres pour financer 
l’innovation 
Dans une économie proche de la « frontière technologique », comme c’est le cas en France, 
la clé de la croissance réside dans l’innovation des entreprises, et donc dans le financement 
par fonds propres sur le long terme : l’innovation étant plus risquée, son financement doit en 
effet rapporter davantage. 
Mais en France, l’épargne des ménages est modestement investie sur des produits de fonds 
propres, ce qui se reflète dans le financement des entreprises. [Planche 2]. Le contraste est 
grand entre les États-Unis, où les fonds propres des entreprises représentent 122 % du PIB, 
et la France où le ratio n’est que de 77 %. De ce point de vue, la France ne se distingue pas 
du reste de la zone euro hors Allemagne (80 %).  
Quelles sont les solutions ? 
Au plan national, le projet de loi PACTE propose certaines avancées en matière 
d’assurance-vie, qui est de loin le premier placement financier des Français (1 700 milliards 
d’euros d’encours à fin 2018), en particulier pour relancer le fonds euro-croissance en le 
rendant plus simple et plus lisible pour les épargnants et pour augmenter les investissements 
des assureurs dans le financement de l’innovation. Les autorités françaises sont également 
très attentives à ce que la revue en cours de la directive Solvabilité 2 soit favorable  
à l’investissement à long terme des assureurs dans les actions. 
Au plan européen [Planche 3], il nous faut construire une véritable « Union de financement 
pour l’investissement et l’innovation » pour mieux mobiliser nos ressources – une épargne 
excédentaire de 345 milliards d’euros dans la zone euro5 – au service des fonds propres et 
de l’innovation. Cette Union de financement doit rassembler et amplifier les initiatives 
existantes, l’Union des marchés de capitaux, l’Union bancaire et le plan d’investissement 
Juncker.

5/7 
 
J’en viens maintenant à la réponse à ma seconde question : la diversification engagée des 
sources de financement est-elle suffisante ? De mon point de vue, la réponse est non car la 
diversification s’accompagne de risques qu’il est nécessaire de bien maîtriser. 
 
II. Diversifier les sources de financement est une entreprise complexe dont le 
succès nécessite de maîtriser tous les risques classiques ou nouveaux 
auxquels font face les intermédiaires 
 
A. En premier lieu, il y a les risques liés à la dette du secteur privé qui croît un peu 
trop vite  
L’endettement de nos entreprises s’accroît beaucoup plus vite que chez nos voisins 
[Planche 4]. Nous sommes maintenant significativement au-dessus de la moyenne de la 
zone euro. La question de la soutenabilité de cet endettement, et de l’impact d’un choc à la 
hausse sur les taux d’intérêt ou à la baisse sur l’activité, se pose. Ce d’autant plus que le 
contexte macroéconomique s’annonce plus incertain (tensions commerciales, budget italien, 
brexit, gilets jaunes). 
Face à cette situation, il était indispensable d’éviter une course sans limite à l’endettement. 
Le Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière, sous la présidence du ministre Bruno Le Maire, a 
ainsi décidé en décembre 2017 d’abaisser à 5 % de leurs fonds propres le plafond des 
expositions des principales banques sur les grandes entreprises les plus endettées. Il a 
aussi décidé d’augmenter le taux du coussin de fonds propres contracyclique des banques 
françaises, de 0,25 % en juin 2018 puis à nouveau de 0,25 % en mars 2020. Ce coussin 
contracyclique, exprimé en pourcentage des fonds propres de base et appliqué aux 
expositions françaises, vise à permettre aux banques de se constituer une réserve de capital 
pour préserver leur capacité d’offre de crédit en cas de retournement du cycle financier, le 
coussin étant alors relâché avec application immédiate.  
Toutefois, ces instruments contraignants ne s’appliquent qu’aux banques, alors que l’on peut 
observer un rôle croissant de l’intermédiation non bancaire dans le financement de 
l’économie. Selon les statistiques de la BCE, les dépôts et les prêts des fonds 
d'investissement de la zone euro ont triplé depuis 2011. Il convient donc de faire évoluer la 
politique macroprudentielle pour mieux appréhender cette nouvelle dimension. Le HCSF 
s’est résolument engagé dans cette voie. Il dispose des pouvoirs pour lui permettre 
d’intervenir au-delà du secteur bancaire et a commencé à travailler à l’élaboration de tests 
de résistance couvrant l’ensemble des secteurs. 
6/7 
 
B. Parallèlement, de nouveaux risques plus structurels émergent également, induits 
par la digitalisation et le réchauffement climatique 
La digitalisation d’abord donne une dimension systémique au risque cyber. En effet, la 
démultiplication des usages numériques contribue à la propagation du risque cyber et 
l’amplifie, via les liens entre les institutions financières, mais aussi entre celles-ci et leurs 
prestataires de services. Le fait que certains de ces prestataires soient des Fintechs et des 
Bigtechs, non réglementés et peu substituables, est un facteur de vulnérabilité 
supplémentaire. 
Pour y faire face, Il faut résister à la tentation du bunker, qui est une impasse et, au 
contraire, imaginer un dispositif de sécurité où celle-ci se conjugue à l’ouverture et à 
l’innovation. C’est dans cet esprit qu’à la Banque de France et à l’ACPR nous travaillons 
avec les autres superviseurs de l’Eurosystème, en faisant en sorte que les entités que nous 
contrôlons prennent en charge le risque cyber et en déployant un programme complet de 
protection des infrastructures que nous exploitons. La cyber-sécurité est l’une des grandes 
priorités de la présidence française du G7 en 2019. Dans ce cadre plus large, la Banque de 
France apporte aussi sa contribution en coordonnant la préparation et la réalisation d'un test 
de cyber-résilience du secteur financier mondial. 
Quant aux risques liés au changement climatique, ils ne peuvent plus être ignorés. Les 
risques physiques – correspondant à la hausse de la fréquence et de la gravité des 
phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes – constituent évidemment les plus visibles et les 
plus immédiats pour le secteur financier. Les risques de transition – liés à l’ajustement vers 
une économie à faible émission de carbone – sont à plus long terme et de ce fait moins 
visibles. Pour mieux les évaluer, nous avons besoin à la fois de mesurer des expositions et 
de réaliser des tests de résistance prospectifs. 
Il nous faut également développer les immenses opportunités associées au financement de 
la transition vers une économie à faible émission de carbone [Planche 5] – il s’agit de 
trouver près de 90 trillions de dollars d’ici 2030 –, tout en prévenant le risque d’éco-
blanchiment (greenwashing). Un beau programme de travail pour le Réseau des banques 
centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système financier (NGFS), lancé par 
la Banque de France en décembre 2017 et qui compte aujourd’hui près de 40 participants ou 
entités sur le point d’adhérer. 
 
 
 
7/7 
 
Pour conclure et résumer mon propos, la diversification engagée des sources de 
financement est la promesse d’un renforcement de la capacité du système financier à 
accompagner l’innovation et une croissance économique durable, dès lors que cette 
diversification demeure encouragée et ses risques bien maîtrisés.  
Face à cette promesse, la lenteur des évolutions observées, les progrès pour l’instant 
modestes vers une union des marchés de capitaux, la complexité des enjeux de la 
digitalisation et de la finance verte doivent nous inciter à continuer d’agir avec détermination, 
patience et persévérance. Chemin faisant nous pourrons trouver soutien et réconfort dans 
cette citation de l’ancien président de la République tchèque, Vaclav Havel : « L’espoir, ce 
n’est pas la conviction qu’une chose aura une issue favorable, mais la certitude que cette 
chose a un sens, quoi qu’il advienne. ». 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

 Symposium Banque de France & 34ème colloque SUERF  
À l’occasion du 20ème anniversaire de l’euro  
Zone euro : tenir le cap dans un monde incertain 
28 mars 2019 
 
 
Remarques introductives de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr).

Bonjour à tous et bienvenue à Paris. Cet évènement n’est pas seulement le 
34ème colloque SUERF mais également le 10ème symposium international de la 
Banque de France. C’est également le dernier symposium de Marc-Olivier et 
je voudrais le remercier chaleureusement ainsi que les équipes du SUERF et 
de la Banque de France pour l’excellent travail qu’elles ont accompli. Je 
voudrais également exprimer ma gratitude envers les intervenants et les 
modérateurs, qui vont jouer un rôle essentiel pour « tenir le cap dans un 
monde incertain ». Dans cette introduction, je vais simplement décrire 
différents types d’incertitude avant d’examiner leurs éventuelles implications 
pour la politique économique.    
** 
1. On peut distinguer quatre différents types d’incertitude  
On parle souvent de l’incertitude comme s’il s’agissait d’un phénomène 
unique. Or, i l existe de multiples sources et formes d’incertitude qui ont des 
conséquences différentes sur la manière dont les décideurs peuvent et doivent 
réagir. Pour introduire vos débats des deux prochains jours, j’en évoquerai 
quatre. 
 
Premièrement, l’incertitude sur l’état de l’économie 
 
Le fait de ne pas savoir précisément où en est l’économie est une forme 
d’incerti tude à laquelle nous sommes constamment confrontés. Les données 
« subjectives » (soft data), telles que les enquêtes et indicateurs de confiance, 
ainsi que les signaux des marchés ne concordent pas toujours avec les 
statistiques officielles objectives (hard statistics), dont on prend généralement 
connaissance avec un certain décalage. Il existe des techniques statistiques 
pour combiner ces sources et produire une estimation rapide 
([contemporaine] : nowcast) mais les intervalles d’erreur autour de ces 
estimations centrales sont encore assez larges. Surtout, ces techniques 
n’apportent pas de réponse à l’un des problèmes les plus difficiles : comment 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
interpréter des facteurs dits « idiosyncratiques » ? Par exemple, dans quelle 
mesure le récent essoufflement de l’économie allemande est-il dû à l’industrie 
automobile et aux nouvelles normes d’émission ou au bas niveau du Rhin et 
peut-être au changement climatique ? Ce sont des questions très difficiles à 
résoudre.                       
 
Deuxièmement, l’incertitude liée à la trajectoire future 
 
Si l’on ne parvient pas à se situer avec certitude, on sait encore moins où l’on 
va ; ne serait-ce qu’en raison des chocs que l’on ne peut prévoir précisément. 
Le ralentissement possible en Chine ou les différents choix concernant le 
Brexit – ce dont vous allez débattre aujourd’hui – en sont deux exemples.   
 
La dynamique économique dépend également de la dynamique sous-jacente 
qui est très difficile à évaluer. L’actuel ralentissement de la croissance est-il 
temporaire ou va-t-il se poursuivre? Récemment, les projections 
macroéconomiques de la BCE relatives à la croissance du PIB en volume ont 
été révisées à la baisse, fortement pour 2019 mais légèrement pour 2020.  
 
Troisièmement, l’incertitude stratégique 
 
Dans certains cas, l’incertitude à laquelle nous sommes confrontés dépend de 
ce que d’autres décideurs vont faire. Cela est particulièrement pernicieux 
lorsque l’imprévisibilité est considérée comme une source d’avantage 
stratégique. Par exemple, la menace, en apparence crédible, de prendre des 
mesures aboutissant à un désavantage mutuel peut inciter l’autre partie à faire 
des concessions (ou pas). C’est ce que Richard Nixon, ancien Président des 
États-Unis, appelait la « théorie du fou » en parlant de la guerre du Vietnam et 
cette notion trouve actuellement écho dans les conflits commerciaux que nous 
connaissons à l’échelle internationale. Ce comportement nuit au 
multilatéralisme qui a été une source importante de stabi lité et de croissance 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
pendant de nombreuses décennies. Si l’incertitude stratégique est source 
d’avantage unilatéral, elle ne se dissipera pas, mais restera une source de 
risque latent pour la politique économique. 
 
Enfin, l’incertitude liée aux changements structurels et à la politique 
monétaire 
 
Certains changements structurels qui se produisent, notamment dans 
l’économie de la zone euro, mais également ailleurs, sont mal compris. La 
transition démographique en cours, par exemple, modifie les décisions liées à 
l’emploi, à l’investissement et à l’épargne, ce qui réduira probablement le taux 
d’intérêt naturel.   
 
Les mécanismes de transmission de la politique monétaire semblent 
également en train d’évoluer. Une période prolongée de politique monétaire 
accommodante a stimulé la croissance et l’emploi, ce qui s’est finalement 
traduit par une augmentation du salaire nominal : cette première partie de la 
courbe de Phillips est à l’œuvre. Mais l’augmentation du salaire nominal ne 
s’est pas encore transmise à l’inflation sous-jacente. Cela devrait finir par être 
le cas, mais les questions plus pertinentes – quand et dans quelle mesure ? – 
n’ont pas de réponse claire. Par conséquent, i l n’y a pas de relation 
mécanique unique entre les instruments de politique monétaire et l’inflation, 
mais plutôt une distribution de réponses probables. En outre, les différences 
observées entre pays de la zone euro (ou entre États aux États-Unis) du point 
de vue des tendances démographiques et des choix de politiques structurelles 
sont susceptibles de créer ou de perpétuer l’hétérogénéité entre grandes 
zones monétaires, sujet dont vous débattrez demain matin. 
 
 
 
 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
2. Comment répondre à de telles incertitudes ? 
Sans préjuger des discussions à venir, permettez-moi de proposer quelques 
réponses possibles.  
 
J’examinerai, dans un premier temps, la question de l’incertitude entre 
banquiers centraux quant à la politique monétaire. Jusqu’à présent c’est, fort 
heureusement, la plus simple : nous ne sommes pas engagés dans ce que 
l’on appelle en anglais « game of chicken » que l’on pourrait traduire par le  
« jeu des poules mouillées » ; et la clarté qui prévaut entre nous quant aux 
intentions de poli tique monétaire profite à tous. Les échanges fréquents que 
nous avons à la BRI, au G7, au G20 et même lors d’événements tels que ce 
Symposium sont précieux pour établir une confiance mutuelle et écarter 
l’éventualité de surprises importantes en matière de politique monétaire. Nos 
politiques monétaires sont indépendantes, ce qui est légitime, mais elles sont 
concertées et nous nous engageons à éviter les guerres monétaires. Il est 
évident que la clarté quant à nos fonctions de réaction s’étend également aux 
marchés financiers et au grand public. 
 
Deuxièmement, comment pourrions-nous répondre à l’incertitude relative à 
l’état de l’économie et à celle liée à la trajectoire future ? La réponse 
théorique, qui remonte à Theil et Tinbergen, consiste à concevoir l’hypothèse 
la plus probable, puis à agir comme si l’on en était complètement sûr. Il s’agit 
de l’approche parfois qualifiée de l’« équivalent certain ». Il existe toutefois 
dans ce type de modèles des hypothèses de symétries qui ne se vérifient pas 
nécessairement dans le monde réel. L’incertitude entourant la prévision 
centrale peut être faussée dans une direction.  
 
Le fait d’appliquer l’approche de l’équivalent certain suppose également que 
l’on considère de manière égale les erreurs à la hausse et les erreurs à la 
baisse. Mais dans la mesure où l’inflation demeure inférieure à l’objecti f, de 
même que les anticipations d’inflation à long terme [market-based long-term 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
inflation expectations], des chocs à la hausse seraient actuellement mieux 
accueillis que des chocs à la baisse. 
 
À ce stade, permettez-moi d’ajouter quelques mots sur les taux négatifs dans 
le prolongement des remarques que j’avais faites à Lisbonne en février 
dernier, et d’énoncer une évidence : nous sommes en mars 2019, non en 
mars 2016, date à laquelle nous avions abaissé le taux de la facilité de dépôt 
à – 0,40%. Cet intervalle de temps a deux conséquences :   
• Premièrement, i l existait, à ce moment-là, des risques déflationnistes 
importants et nous avions décidé en conséquence un calibrage fort de 
nos réponses monétaires. Ces risques déflationnistes s’étant à présent 
atténués, il est évident qu’il n’y a aucune raison de fixer des taux encore 
plus négatifs. 
• Deuxièmement, nous avons un recul de 3 ans concernant les effets 
combinés exercés par nos différents outils de politique monétaire non 
conventionnels, notamment les taux négatifs, sur l’intermédiation 
financière et leur impact sur la transmission de notre politique monétaire 
– dont les effets combinés pourraient avoir évolué au fil du temps. Ainsi, 
Mario Draghi a souligné à juste titre que nous devons approfondir le 
suivi du canal du crédit bancaire et réfléchir aux mesures possibles que 
nous pouvons prendre pour préserver les effets favorables des taux 
négatifs pour l’économie, tout en atténuant leurs éventuels effets 
indésirables.  
 
L’incerti tude knightienne est une situation différente dans laquelle il n’est pas 
possible d’attribuer des probabilités ; il s’agit d’un concept que reconnaîtrait 
instantanément toute personne essayant de prévoir les récents soubresauts 
de la Chambre des communes. Dans de telles situations, on soutient 
généralement que la meilleure stratégie consiste à essayer d’éviter les 
conséquences les plus défavorables, comme nous l’avons fait en nous 
préparant à un Brexit sans accord. Et il faut parfois faire preuve d’audace pour 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
éviter des résultats vraiment mauvais, exactement comme l’a fait Mario Draghi 
quand il a déclaré que l’Eurosystème ferait « tout ce qui est nécessaire ». 
 
Troisièmement, comment devons-nous réagir face à l’incertitude relative aux 
liens structurels ? L’incertitude relative au mécanisme de transmission est 
souvent utilisée pour justifier le fait d’agir de manière progressive. Se décrivant 
parfois comme « marchant sur la pointe des pieds dans l’obscurité», un 
banquier central qui suit le principe de Brainard modère sa réponse aux chocs 
inflationnistes s’il n’est pas certain de la sensibilité précise de l’inflation à la 
politique monétaire. Mais plus il se montre prudent lors de cette première 
étape, plus il doit être prêt à prendre des mesures supplémentaires : le 
gradualisme n’est pas l’inaction. 
 
Les changements structurels dans l’économie modifient également en 
permanence la dynamique économique et les relations d’équi libre, telles que r 
étoile (le taux d’intérêt neutre) et u étoile (le taux de chômage dit naturel). Mais 
comme l’a souligné John Williams de la Réserve fédérale de New York, ces 
étoiles s’apparentent davantage aujourd’hui à une tâche floue qu’à une unique 
source éclatante de lumière. Même si elles peuvent contribuer à l’orientation 
globale de la politique monétaire, l’incertitude entourant ces étoiles est trop 
grande pour permettre une navigation précise.  
 
Par conséquent, dans l’ensemble, les orientations théoriques quant à la 
manière de répondre à l’incertitude restent elles-mêmes ouvertes, c’est le 
moins que l’on puisse dire. Ma compréhension des débats actuels me conduit 
à formuler les quatre suggestions pragmatiques suivantes de nature, je 
l’espère, à alimenter vos discussions. 
 
1. Rester très clairs sur vos objectifs – les périodes d’incertitude ne sont 
pas le bon moment pour susciter des doutes supplémentaires sur, par 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
exemple, votre cible d’inflation et sur votre capacité et votre 
détermination à utiliser vos outils au cours d’une séquence prévisible.  
2. Mais, tout en restant cohérent avec votre orientation, il faut être très 
flexible s’agissant du calendrier précis et du calibrage de la mise en 
œuvre de vos mesures. En résumé, être aussi prévisible que possible 
mais jamais prédéterminés. 
3. Agir pour éviter que les pires résultats ne se produisent mais sans 
apporter une garantie totale, qui créerait un aléa moral. 
4. Ne jamais fonder la politique monétaire sur une seule trajectoire 
attendue pour l’économie. 
 
En conclusion, nous ne pouvons pas chercher à contrôler, ou éviter 
l’incertitude ; au lieu de cela, nous devons mettre en œuvre les stratégies qui 
sont les plus robustes face à elle. Le philosophe français Edgar Morin l’a 
joliment énoncé : « La connaissance progresse en intégrant l’incertitude, non 
en l’exorcisant ».  
 
En gardant cela à l’esprit, permettez-moi de vous souhaiter à tous un 
symposium très fructueux, avec des échanges animés et instructifs. Christine, 
la parole est à vous.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un plaisir d’être à Bucarest aujourd’hui pour clôturer ce séminaire de 
haut niveau Eurofi. Je remercie D. Wright et D. Cahen de me donner 
l’opportunité de faire cette intervention...mais je les remercie peut-être un peu 
moins pour le thème qu’ils m’ont demandé de traiter : « Les opportunités de 
développer l’autonomie de l’UE dans la zone financière post-Brexit ». Nous 
sommes toujours confrontés à de grandes incertitudes et le Brexit est, et reste, 
une mauvaise nouvelle, non seulement pour le Royaume-Uni mais également 
pour l’Europe. Ce territoire inconnu a toutefois le mérite de rendre une chose 
très claire : il est coûteux de sortir du marché unique. Nous espérons donc 
toujours le meilleur, mais nous devons nous préparer au pire : un Brexit sans 
accord avec tous les risques qu’il comporte. Ce sera le premier point que 
j’aborderai aujourd’hui. Ensuite, votre thème nous oblige à regarder vers 
l’avenir, au-delà du Brexit : les européens doivent utiliser les impératifs créés 
par le contexte actuel pour bâtir un « Eurosystème financier » plus intégré et 
ajouter des piliers à la souveraineté financière européenne.  
** 
I. Se préparer aux risques 
Il était avant tout de la responsabilité du secteur financier lui-même de se 
préparer aux conséquences du Brexit, à commencer par la perte du passeport 
européen. Les superviseurs, au niveau national comme au niveau européen, 
ont encouragé et suivi la mise en œuvre des plans de contingence. À ce jour, 
la plupart des grands acteurs ont pris les dispositions nécessaires, mais des 
inquiétudes subsistent s’agissant du niveau de préparation des acteurs de 
taille plus modeste, notamment les établissements de paiement et de monnaie 
électronique. Par ailleurs, des mesures publiques ont été prises pour traiter les 
risques spécifiques d’un Brexit sans accord qui pourraient menacer la stabilité 
financière ou la protection des consommateurs. La reconnaissance temporaire 
et conditionnelle des chambres de compensation britanniques devrait 
empêcher les effets de falaise, ainsi que les dérogations temporaires à 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
l’obligation de compensation et d’échange bilatéral de marges pour une 
catégorie limitée de produits. Les États membres ont également adapté leurs 
réglementations nationales ou prévoient de le faire. En France, une loi a été 
adoptée qui assure la continuité des contrats pour les activités transfrontières 
et un accès étendu aux systèmes de règlement du Royaume-Uni.  
  
II. Bâtir un Eurosystème financier 
Permettez-moi d’aborder à présent le cœur de mon sujet. La triste réalité est 
que le Brexit ne nous laisse pas d’autre choix : nous devons à présent 
réorganiser le système financier européen et développer son autonomie. La 
zone euro peut déjà tirer parti d’importants atouts : un Eurosystème monétaire 
efficace, le cadre juridique du marché financier unique et les composantes 
essentielles d’une Union bancaire. Mais nous ne disposons pas encore d’un 
« Eurosystème financier », constitué d’institutions financières paneuropéennes 
plus fortes et d’infrastructures de marché. Soyons clairs : il n’y aura pas une 
City unique pour le continent, mais plutôt un réseau polycentrique intégré de 
places financières, avec des spécialisations par domaines d’expertises. Un tel 
système polycentrique peut fonctionner, comme en témoigne l’exemple des 
États-Unis : la place financière de New York est privilégiée par les banques de 
financement et d’investissement, la place de Chicago traite des futures, tandis 
que celle de Boston est spécialisée dans la gestion d’actifs.  
 
 S’agissant tout d’abord de l’Union bancaire, son succès dépend de la 
finalisation d’un mécanisme de résolution robuste, sans doute bien plus que 
d’un système complet et commun de garantie des dépôts. Concernant le filet 
de sécurité du Fonds de Résolution Unique, des considérations de stabilité 
financière doivent nous conduire à envisager une durée plus longue pour les 
lignes de crédit.  Mais nous ne parviendrons pas à mettre en place une Union 
bancaire efficace et bénéfique sans consolidation transfrontière en Europe : il 
existe encore trop d’obstacles et trop peu de restructurations transfrontières. 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
Comparé au marché américain, le secteur bancaire européen reste 
fragmenté : la part de marché des 5 principales banques européennes s’élève 
à 20 % contre plus de 40 % aux États-Unis. Nous devons donc nous fixer 
comme objectif la création d’un « marché bancaire unique », comme l’a 
récemment proposé Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, dans lequel de véritables 
groupes bancaires pan-européens pourraient exercer plus efficacement leurs 
activités et mieux faire face à la concurrence internationale. En outre, 
l’intégration bancaire renforce la résilience des banques en réduisant leur 
exposition à des chocs asymétriques, conduisant à un partage des risques 
accru et à une meilleure allocation des ressources. Une étape utile vers la 
formation de véritables groupes bancaires pan-européens pourrait consister à 
réduire les exigences en fonds propres pour les filiales européennes, tout en 
préservant leur situation financière par le biais de garanties transfrontières 
crédibles fournies par la maison mère, qui pourraient être déclenchées tant en 
périodes normales que dans les situations de crise. Ce dispositif serait fondé 
sur le droit de l’Union européenne et mis en application par les autorités de 
l’Union européenne. 
À cela s’ajoute un constat évident sur la réglementation bancaire : il est à 
présent souhaitable de stabiliser la visibilité sur les exigences totales de fonds 
propres, qui s’additionnent à partir de différentes origines. La transposition 
sans heurt de Bâle 3 contribue à cette clarification, notamment la mise en 
œuvre d’un output floor seulement au niveau consolidé au sein de l’Union 
européenne : dans le cas contraire, nous aurons introduit un nouvel obstacle 
aux activités transfrontières au sein de l’Europe. 
Outre l’Union bancaire, une véritable Union des marchés de capitaux (UMC) 
est essentielle pour renforcer l’intégration financière en Europe : Jens 
Weidmann, le président de la Bundesbank, et moi-même avons 
vigoureusement plaidé en sa faveur dans une tribune commune publiée hier.  
L’Union des marchés de capitaux sera également au centre des discussions 
lors de ce Conseil Ecofin informel, organisé par la présidence roumaine. 
Malgré quelques avancées récentes, les progrès sur ce sujet s’avèrent 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
difficiles et lents. Passons enfin du consensus de principe, dans les mots, aux 
avancées concrètes, notamment en ce qui concerne les instruments, l’accès 
au financement des PME et la supervision. 
À cet égard, je salue les progrès réalisés en ce qui concerne le produit 
paneuropéen d’épargne retraite individuelle (Pan-European Personal Pension 
Product – PEPP) : ce produit est transférable d’un État membre à l’autre et 
offre au consommateur une gamme plus large de possibilités 
d’investissement. Nous devons également faire des progrès vers 
l’harmonisation des régimes d’insolvabilité. Cela devrait faciliter les 
investissements transfrontières.  
Un des enjeux les plus importants de l’Union des marchés de capitaux est de 
permettre aux PME de lever des fonds propres plus facilement et à moindre 
coût, afin de soutenir leur croissance. Le financement par fonds propres 
constitue un facteur essentiel d’innovation : il est mieux adapté à l’incertitude 
et offre des rendements à long terme associés aux projets innovants. Dans ce 
domaine, la zone euro est très en retard : les fonds propres ne représentent 
que 80 % du PIB contre 122 % aux États-Unis. 
Des marchés de capitaux intégrés nécessitent également une supervision 
efficace. Là aussi, grâce aux résultats de la récente revue des autorités 
européennes de surveillance (ESA), des étapes importantes ont été franchies 
vers un renforcement de leur rôle. S’agissant de la surveillance des marchés 
financiers, l’ESMA contribuera, dans un premier temps, à une plus grande 
convergence des pratiques en matière de supervision. À plus long terme, 
cependant, ses pouvoirs en matière de supervision directe devraient être 
étendus, à commencer par la supervision des marchés de gros. S’agissant du 
secteur de l’assurance, une attention particulière a été portée au renforcement 
de la supervision des activités transfrontières grâce à l’EIOPA. Je salue 
également le rôle renforcé de l’EBA sur les questions relatives à la lutte contre 
le blanchiment d’argent et le financement du terrorisme, domaine dans lequel 
les améliorations du cadre européen sont absolument nécessaires. 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
Enfin, l’Union des marchés de capitaux nécessite des infrastructures de 
marché robustes. Grâce au règlement EMIR II, l’Europe s’est dotée – via 
l’ESMA – des compétences nécessaires pour superviser directement les 
contreparties centrales de pays tiers qui ont une empreinte systémique vis-à-
vis de l’UE. Cela étant, EMIR II ne marque pas la fin de nos avancées. 
Beaucoup reste encore à faire en ce qui concerne le rôle de la BCE ou les 
prérogatives de l’ESMA envers les contreparties centrales de l’UE. 
L’Union bancaire comme l’Union des marchés de capitaux sont les 
composantes essentielles de ce que Jens Weidmann et moi-même appelons 
une véritable « Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation » : 
cette idée permettra de mieux mobiliser nos ressources abondantes – notre 
excédent d’épargne de 340 milliards d’euros en 2018 – pour les besoins 
concrets de l’économie européenne : la transition énergétique, les fonds 
propres des PME, ou encore l’innovation numérique. Cette appellation unifiée 
a le mérite de mettre en lumière, pour le grand public, les finalités de cette 
Union : l’investissement et l’innovation, en d’autres termes le financement de 
l’avenir.  
 
III. Des piliers pour une souveraineté financière européenne  
À plus long terme, nous devrons construire trois piliers essentiels de la future 
souveraineté financière européenne. Tout d’abord, l’UE doit renforcer sa 
position en tant qu’autorité responsable de l’élaboration des règles grâce des 
régimes d’équivalence améliorés. Le Brexit a donné un nouvel élan à cette 
question : une réévaluation complète des régimes d’équivalence existants est 
essentielle étant donné l’ampleur des relations entre l’UE et le Royaume-Uni. 
Au-delà de la question du Brexit, l’examen des régimes d’équivalence est 
également l’occasion de les améliorer. La procédure d’octroi des équivalences 
doit être plus transparente et s’inscrire dans un cadre institutionnel global. Le 
suivi et le contrôle des décisions d’équivalence pourraient également être 
améliorés en accordant davantage de pouvoir aux ESA et en offrant à la 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
Commission européenne des options plus graduelles grâce à des outils 
flexibles en cas de divergence réglementaire : par exemple, le retrait 
temporaire, partiel ou conditionnel de l’équivalence.  
Le deuxième pilier de la souveraineté financière européenne concerne 
l’efficacité des paiements de détail et des infrastructures de marché. 
S’agissant des paiements de détail, l’espace unique de paiement en euros 
(Single Euro Payments Area - SEPA) est certes une réussite, mais il faut 
encore accroître la convergence, face à l’influence croissante des grandes 
entreprises de pays tiers dans les solutions de paiement. Afin de préserver 
notre souveraineté, une stratégie européenne pour les paiements de détail 
serait nécessaire, afin de (i) remédier à la fragmentation du marché et 
promouvoir des solutions européennes unifiées, (ii) améliorer la protection des 
données relatives aux paiements et (iii) encourager les acteurs européens à 
prendre part à la concentration actuelle dans le secteur des paiements de 
détail. S’agissant des infrastructures, le Système européen de banques 
centrales a pris ses responsabilités afin de renforcer l’intégration post-marché 
à l’échelle européenne, notamment grâce à la plateforme T2S. Au cours des 
prochaines années, la mise en place d’une plateforme unifiée de gestion des 
garanties, exploitée par l’Eurosystème, constituera une nouvelle étape clé 
contribuant directement à l’efficacité de l’Union des marchés de capitaux. 
S’agissant du troisième pilier, le rôle international de l’euro est une 
composante essentielle de notre souveraineté financière européenne. Après 
avoir connu une forte hausse, l’utilisation internationale de l’euro a diminué 
depuis les crises financières de 2008-2012 et demeure limitée par rapport à 
celle du dollar. Le dollar est clairement un atout dans l’exercice du pouvoir 
américain, alors que, dans le même temps, la Chine se soucie de 
l’internationalisation du renminbi. Une plus grande utilisation de l’euro 
contribuerait à protéger nos entreprises des risques de change ou de conflits 
commerciaux à l’étranger. À cet égard, les mesures concrètes recensées par 
la Commission européenne en décembre dernier sont particulièrement 
pertinentes. Le développement de systèmes de paiement instantané 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
intégralement unifiés en Europe, de marchés de capitaux intégrés et la 
création possible d’un actif sûr libellé en euro devrait, entre autres, contribuer 
au développement international de l’euro.  
 
** 
En cette période critique, je souhaiterais conclure en citant quelques vers 
d’Othello : « Gémir sur un malheur passé est le plus sûr moyen d'en attirer un 
autre ». Le moyen le plus sûr de surmonter une épreuve telle que le Brexit est 
d’en tirer le meilleur. Notre réponse collective au Brexit doit être la poursuite 
de l’intégration en Europe : si nous en restions aux arguties techniques, à 
l’autosatisfaction des uns et aux attaques des autres, et à la défiance de tous, 
nous aurions plus que manqué une opportunité. Nous aurions collectivement 
manqué à notre responsabilité. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Conférence du NGFS  
Network for Greening the Financial System  
Paris, 17 avril 2019 
Les banques centrales et les superviseurs agissent pour le climat 
 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Risque Climatique – Call to Action 
 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi de vous accueillir dans les locaux de la Banque de France pour 
démarrer cette séance publique de la conférence NGFS. Nous attendions ce moment depuis 
longtemps et nous y voilà. Le NGFS publie aujourd’hui son premier rapport complet, intitulé « A 
call for action » et qui comprend six recommandations. 
 
Thomas Paine, philosophe politique né en Angleterre et citoyen du monde, a déclaré dans The 
American Crisis (vers 1776) : « S’il doit y avoir la guerre, qu’elle ait lieu de mon temps afin que 
mon enfant puisse vivre en paix ». Le changement climatique est une réalité, mondiale et 
irréversible. Même si la responsabilité de la lutte contre le changement climatique incombe 
avant tout aux pouvoirs publics, la participation de tous est néanmoins nécessaire, comme le 
démontre aujourd’hui la présence d’un public large et divers. En effet, « empêcher l’avion de 
s’écraser » demande un effort constant auquel s’attelle aujourd’hui un nombre toujours 
croissant d’institutions. 
Dans le but de généraliser la finance verte, le monde financier ne peut se substituer aux 
décideurs politiques mais il peut aider. Et la Banque de France, en tant que banque centrale et 
superviseur, est déterminée à apporter son aide. L’année dernière, à Amsterdam, j’ai même 
qualifié ce défi de « nouvelle frontière ». C’est pourquoi en décembre 2017, à l’occasion du One 
Planet Summit, nous avons lancé le Réseau des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le 
 
 
verdissement du système financier (NGFS). En 16 mois, notre « coalition des volontés » a 
presque quintuplé, passant de 8 membres fondateurs à plus de 40 membres et observateurs. 
Le NGFS est présidé par Frank Elderson et la Banque de France en assure le secrétariat. Nous 
sommes aujourd’hui représentés sur les cinq continents ; les pays dont les membres du NGFS 
sont issus contribuent pour 44 % au PIB mondial et pour 45 % aux émissions de gaz à effets de 
serre. Nous assurons collectivement la supervision des deux tiers des institutions financières 
d’importance systémique, banques comme assurances. Ce qui apparaît aujourd’hui comme une 
évidence pour la plupart d’entre nous n’était pas écrit à l’avance.  
Avec pour objectif que l’Accord de Paris soit un succès, le premier rapport complet du NGFS a 
le potentiel nécessaire pour agir comme un levier sur le système financier et j’espère qu’il 
ouvrira la voie à un changement de paradigme dans la communauté plus large des banquiers 
centraux.   
Dans mes remarques d’aujourd’hui, (i) je dresserai le bilan des réalisations, qui sont 
significatives, des banquiers centraux et des autorités de supervision en matière de lutte contre 
le changement climatique et (ii) je présenterai les quatre missions importantes qui nous 
attendent encore. 
I. Les banques centrales et les superviseurs avancent rapidement pour dresser la 
photographie des risques 
Dans son premier rapport d’étape, publié à Bali en octobre 2018, le NGFS a conclu à 
l’unanimité que « les risques liés au changement climatique sont source de risques financiers. 
Par conséquent, il appartient aux banques centrales et aux superviseurs, dans le cadre de leur 
mandat, de veiller à la résilience du système financier face à ces risques ». Que doit-on faire 
alors ? 
a. Intégrer les risques liés au changement climatique à la surveillance 
microprudentielle 
Il s’agit là d’une tâche ambitieuse et complexe, pour laquelle des progrès ont été réalisés dans 
de nombreux pays. S’agissant des modes d’action envisageables pour les superviseurs, je suis 
convaincu que notre première priorité doit être la publication des expositions existantes dans le 
secteur financier, ce que j’appelle généralement « la photographie des risques ». Plusieurs 
superviseurs ont ouvert la voie : la DNB, la Banque d’Angleterre/PRA et l’autorité de 
surveillance française (ACPR). L’ACPR a publié la semaine dernière un deuxième rapport sur 
les expositions des banques et des assureurs français aux risques liés au changement 
climatique. Ce rapport donne une vision plus claire des risques et des opportunités liés au 
climat : les actifs des sociétés financières exposés aux risques physiques restent peu 
importants en France car les investissements sont notamment réalisés dans des zones à très 
faible risque ; les expositions des banques aux risques liés à la transition ont légèrement 
diminué entre 2015 et 2017, et représentent aujourd’hui 12 % environ des expositions totales 
au risque de crédit. Notre superviseur a également une vision plus claire des zones d’ombre du 
 
 
cadre de gestion des risques, auxquelles il convient de remédier : les instances de 
gouvernance, au plus haut niveau de décision, des établissements bancaires et des organismes 
d’assurance s’impliquent de manière croissante dans le pilotage des risques liés au 
changement climatique mais le degré d’implication au sein du secteur financier français est 
encore hétérogène ; la granularité de l’analyse fournie par les banques et par les sociétés 
d’assurance demeure insuffisante. 
Cette étape doit être largement encouragée auprès des membres du NGFS qui, j’en suis 
convaincu, doivent tirer parti des meilleures pratiques identifiées au sein du réseau. Par 
conséquent, je me réjouis qu’un manuel de surveillance soit rédigé en tant que livrable 
technique du NGFS pour 2019-2020. 
b. Intégrer des facteurs de développement durable dans la gestion des 
portefeuilles pour comptes propres 
Les banques centrales doivent émettre le bon signal et donner l’exemple dans leurs politiques 
d’investissement et de publication de l’information. La DNB a adhéré aux Principes pour 
l’investissement responsable des Nations unies. Norges bank, qui gère le fonds souverain 
norvégien, préconise une diversification de portefeuille et met en œuvre une stratégie de 
désinvestissement dans les secteurs du pétrole et du gaz. À la Banque de France, nous avons 
adopté, en mars de l’année dernière, une charte d’investissement responsable pour la gestion 
de nos fonds propres et de nos portefeuilles de retraite, afin qu’ils soient alloués à des fonds 
d’investissement responsables sur le plan social et environnemental. En mars 2019, nous 
avons publié nos expositions aux risques liés au changement climatique et nous sommes la 
première banque centrale à l’avoir fait. Nous travaillons également à la poursuite de 
l’alignement de nos modalités de publication de l’information sur celles prônées par la TCFD, en 
tenant compte de nos spécificités en tant que banque centrale. Nous sommes convaincus que 
notre expérience sera utile pour permettre aux membres du NGFS de définir de meilleures 
pratiques s’agissant de l’investissement ESG des banques centrales. 
  
Nous pouvons être fiers de ce que nous avons accompli en 16 mois, mais « il est temps de 
retrousser nos manches » : la perspective d’un réchauffement climatique de plus de 2°C à 
l’échelle mondiale nous contraint à faire mieux et à agir maintenant. Le développement de 
solutions pratiques est désormais en tête de la « Saison 2 » du NGFS. 
 
II. La voie à suivre par les banques centrales/les superviseurs et aussi par les autres 
acteurs 
a. La publication d’informations et les taxonomies sont les deux faces d’une 
même médaille 
Nous sommes actuellement confrontés au dilemme de l’œuf et de la poule.  Pour combler les 
lacunes en matière de données, nous devons nous appuyer sur la publication d’informations 
 
 
améliorées qui doivent être élaborées sur la base de taxonomies solides. Mais nous avons 
besoin de données pour élaborer une taxonomie appropriée ! 
Il est temps de suivre la trajectoire fixée par la TCFD, d’une part, et la Commission européenne 
d’autre part, pour répondre à toutes ces questions simultanément. Cela signifie travailler 
conjointement sur la publication d’informations financières et les taxonomies. Cela permettra 
notamment d’améliorer la qualité des informations publiées et, à terme, leur pertinence pour 
intégrer, dans toutes les entreprises, l’externalité négative représentée actuellement par le 
changement climatique. 
Nous serons alors en mesure d’évoluer graduellement vers une transparence obligatoire 
reposant sur le principe « se conformer ou s’expliquer », pour laquelle l’article 173 de la loi 
française relative à la transition énergétique pourrait servir de référence. 
b. L’intégration des risques liés au changement climatique dans le suivi de la 
stabilité financière 
Il reste beaucoup à faire pour compléter la « vidéo des risques ». Jusqu’à présent, il nous 
semble que les primes de risque ne reflètent pas correctement les risques climatiques. Et par 
conséquent, je considère que nous devons, en tant que banques centrales et autorités de 
supervision, promouvoir une vision prospective de l’impact des risques climatiques. Afin de 
mesurer correctement les effets financiers du changement climatique, notre objectif est clair : 
nous devons être capables de concevoir des stress tests climatiques complets.  
De quoi s’agit-il en pratique ? La photographie des risques fournit des informations sur les 
expositions. Mais la réalisation d’une analyse basée sur des scénarios suppose d’assembler 
trois « briques » : 
- quelques scénarios de transition assez sévères mais réalistes jusqu’en 2050. Le NGFS 
y travaille et prévoit de publier bientôt plusieurs documents techniques ; 
- certaines hypothèses macroéconomiques pour rendre compte de l’incidence du 
changement climatique sur les variables macroéconomiques (productivité, inflation, 
chômage,...) ; 
- les expositions directes et indirectes du système financier aux risques climatiques. En 
l’espèce, la publication d’informations financières peut naturellement aider. 
Nous n’y sommes pas encore, l’analyse des risques climatiques doit s’appuyer sur de nouveaux 
outils méthodologiques afin de relever les défis liés aux conséquences à long terme, par 
exemple en rendant compte des changements technologiques et des modifications de priorités 
politiques et de comportement social, de la non-homogénéité et de la non-linéarité des impacts, 
et de l’irréversibilité des effets. L’agenda climatique nous oblige à dépasser l’horizon standard 
d’un an utilisé pour les probabilités de défaut. 
 
c. L’économie verte en est encore à ses débuts et a besoin de mûrir 
À mesure que le temps passe et que notre capacité à parvenir à un scénario compatible avec 
un réchauffement compris entre 1,5° C et 2° C est sérieusement remise en question, le montant 
 
 
nécessaire pour financer la transition augmente de façon constante. La demande d’actifs verts 
est forte, mais l’offre ne suit pas. Ce défi quantitatif est lié aux investissements massifs 
nécessaires pour favoriser la poursuite du développement des technologies et pour 
accompagner les changements des comportements sociaux. Les montants en jeu varient mais, 
à titre d’illustration, le Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC) 
estime dans son dernier rapport, publié en octobre dernier, que les investissements dans 
l’efficacité énergétique devraient atteindre 900 milliards de dollars par an pour limiter le 
réchauffement climatique à 1,5°C d’ici 2050, tandis que les émissions d’obligations vertes en 
2018 ont représenté 149 milliards d’euros. Le financement vert nécessite un cadre propice à 
l’innovation : des prêts verts, la titrisation verte, des obligations sécurisées vertes, des produits 
dérivés verts, des plateformes de financement participatif vertes et des fonds de 
capital-investissement verts devraient tous être encouragés, en gardant à l’esprit notre cap, qui 
consiste à préserver la stabilité financière. Les travaux du Groupe d’experts techniques de la 
Commission européenne sur la finance durable, concernant notamment le développement de 
labels et indices de référence verts, doivent être bien compris par le système financier comme 
modifiant les règles du jeu : la finance verte doit véritablement mûrir, se professionnaliser et se 
tenir à l’écart des pratiques « d’écoblanchiment » (green washing). 
La finance verte a effectivement la capacité d’être une force de transformation puissante, mais il 
n’y aura pas de transition vers un futur bas carbone sans un engagement plus poussé des 
entreprises privées, des grandes entreprises jusqu’aux PME. Les institutions financières 
peuvent exercer un effet d’entraînement, via la publication d’informations financières complètes 
répondant aux obligations du reporting climat ou des stratégies de désinvestissement dédiées. 
Mais l’économie réelle doit se saisir en propre de la transition. Une fois de plus, des politiques 
publiques appropriées, comme un prix du carbone crédible, créeront les meilleures incitations.  
 
d. Poursuivre de manière inclusive le déroulé de l’agenda climatique  
Le changement climatique déclenchera de forts effets redistributifs : l’agriculture suédoise 
pourrait bénéficier d’une augmentation de la température moyenne à la surface du globe, tandis 
que, dans un scénario de +4°C, 145 millions de personnes en Chine sont menacées par 
l’élévation du niveau de la mer. Il y aura des gagnants et des perdants au niveau international 
mais aussi au sein des pays. 
Il faut donc renforcer une coopération internationale qui favorisera une transition équitable au 
niveau mondial vers une économie à faible émission de carbone. Chacun d’entre nous – société 
civile, États, régulateurs internationaux, milieux académiques, ONG et think tanks, entreprises 
et institutions financières, banques centrales, superviseurs et instances normatives – a un rôle à 
jouer : c’est un défi commun auquel personne ne peut s’attaquer seul. 
Nous devons également concentrer nos efforts et notre attention sur les pays émergents et les 
économies en développement qui sont généralement plus durement touchés par les risques 
climatiques et sont également davantage confrontés aux risques environnementaux au sens 
 
 
large (tels que la pollution atmosphérique, la pollution et la raréfaction de l’eau, la contamination 
des sols, la réduction de la biodiversité ou encore la déforestation). Sur la seule année 2017, 
près de 5 millions de personnes dans le monde sont mortes des suites de la pollution 
atmosphérique. Bien que la dégradation de l’environnement et les risques (financiers) associés 
soient souvent de portée plus locale, il existe néanmoins des raisons impérieuses pour 
lesquelles le NGFS devrait également examiner l’impact des risques environnementaux sur le 
système financier et opérer, selon le type de système financier, une plus grande différenciation 
dans les recommandations fournies. 
  
Conclusion : 
Le succès de l’Accord de Paris dépendra de notre capacité à avancer de manière inclusive. Le 
monde est entre nos mains à tous. Mais certains ont assurément une plus grande influence sur 
son sort. Les banques centrales et les superviseurs, au sein du NGFS et aux côtés des 
hommes et des femmes de bonne volonté, se mobilisent pour atténuer les problèmes causés 
par le changement climatique. Si nous vous voulons que nos enfants vivent en paix, je vous 
appelle tous à agir.

Inauguration de la Cité de l’Économie  
 Paris, 15 mai 2019 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France

Monsieur le Ministre,   
Mesdames et messieurs les parlementaires et élus,  
Mesdames et messieurs les gouverneurs et sous-gouverneurs,  
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
C’est un grand honneur de vous accueillir pour l’inauguration de Citéco, la cité 
de l’Économie. Ce jour marque une date importante dans l’histoire de la 
Banque de France et de son engagement en faveur de l’éducation 
économique et financière du grand public. 
 « Ils ne savaient pas que c’était impossible, alors ils l’ont fait » disait 
Mark Twain. Alors pour raconter en quelques minutes cette histoire 
extraordinaire, je vous propose une trilogie simple : le passé, depuis 140 ans 
et particulièrement de ces 8 dernières années ; le présent de cette naissance, 
celle de Citéco ; le futur autour de cette belle ambition au service de la culture 
économique de nos concitoyens. 
** 
I. 140 ans d’histoire  
Citéco est un lieu de culture et d’éducation installé dans un écrin exceptionnel 
du patrimoine parisien, l’Hôtel Gaillard. Ce bâtiment unique, qui fera l’attrait de 
nombreux visiteurs amateurs d’art, a connu trois vies successives : 
i/ Construit entre 1878 et 1884, il fut d’abord la demeure d’Émile Gaillard, un 
banquier-entrepreneur passionné d’architecture Renaissance, mécène et 
grand collectionneur ; il fut élève de Chopin, banquier de Victor Hugo, et 
financeur des chemins de fer. 
ii/ Puis, en 1923, cet Hôtel fut transformé en succursale de la Banque de 
France au service des entrepreneurs et des épargnants du quartier de la 
plaine Monceau alors en pleine expansion; la succursale « Malesherbes » a 
fonctionné jusqu’en 2006. 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
iii/ Enfin, à partir d’aujourd’hui, l’Hôtel Gaillard devient Citéco et affiche une 
troisième architecture, à la fois respectueuse des deux précédentes et 
pleinement contemporaine. 
Il fallait d’abord l’audace de l’idée. Le projet a été lancé en 2011 par mon 
prédécesseur Christian Noyer, auquel je rends hommage, sous la forme d’un 
concours international d’architectes-muséographe. L’objectif était de 
transformer à nouveau l’Hôtel Gaillard pour donner corps à sa 3ème vie. 
Après l’audace de l’idée, il fallait le courage et la ténacité de la construction. Je 
veux rendre hommage à l’aboutissement d’un travail acharné de huit années 
qui a impliqué directement de nombreux services de la Banque de France 
(équipe projet, service immobilier et sécurité, service des achats, direction 
générale des Études, direction de la Communication), tant pour le bâtiment lui-
même – la Banque de France étant maître d’ouvrage – que pour la conception 
et la réalisation de la muséographie et des parcours proposés aux visiteurs. 
Ce fut un travail collectif, semé des vicissitudes du réel, mais mené à bien.  
Je tenais aujourd’hui à en remercier les bâtisseurs : Les architectes 
auxquels la Banque de France a fait appel, et en particulier Eric PALLOT, 
architecte en chef et inspecteur général des monuments historiques. Les 
47 entreprises, grandes et petites, qui ont contribué à la renaissance de ce 
monument historique et à la création d’une muséographie interactive originale. 
Je salue parmi tant d’autres, côté Banque de France, le rôle de terrain, au 
quotidien, de la directrice du projet, Françoise Sancho. Je remercie également 
Pierre Poulain, si décisif depuis deux ans, et Marc-Olivier Strauss-Kahn dont 
Citéco est un peu l’enfant. 
Il y a eu l’idée, il y a eu les pierres, il y a aujourd’hui l’âme de ce lieu. 
J’exprime aussi ma gratitude aux animateurs  qui font vivre ce beau projet. 
La Banque de France ne gère pas directement Citéco. Elle a mis en place une 
équipe de direction et une gouvernance autonomes dans un cadre associatif. 
Citéco dispose de son personnel et d’un budget de fonctionnement autonome 
auquel contribue la Banque de France sous forme de mécénat. Je remercie 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
chaleureusement Emmanuel Constans qui en est le Président délégué, et je 
dis toute ma confiance à l’équipe de Philippe Gineste, Directeur de Citéco, qui 
est désormais en charge de ce bel outil au service du débat et de l’éducation   
économique et financière. 
II. Le grand jour d’une naissance 
Ce 15 mai est un grand jour avec cette inauguration officielle très attendue. 
Elle nous donne l’occasion de célébrer l’autorisation de la commission de 
sécurité pour l’accueil du public, reçue avant-hier. Citéco sera donc ouverte au 
public à partir du 14 juin, date que j’ai le grand plaisir d’annoncer 
officiellement aujourd’hui. 
Un grand jour pour ce trésor de notre patrimoine, et au-delà du lieu 
exceptionnel, un grand jour également et peut-être surtout pour la pédagogie 
de l’économie. Citéco est une première en Europe, le premier musée de 
l’Économie. Favoriser une meilleure compréhension des mécanismes 
économiques notamment par les plus jeunes grâce au partenariat de Citéco 
avec l’Éducation nationale et tous les enseignants intéressés ; grâce 
également à une pédagogie innovante, interactive et ludique. Notre ambition 
est ici de mettre les fondements de l’économie à la portée de tous. De tous les 
Français, que nous accueillons ici, au-delà bien sûr des Franciliens. Notre 
ambition est aussi de créer un lieu ouvert à la discussion : l’économie ne 
concerne pas que les institutions, elle est aussi, et surtout, du ressort des 
citoyens, des jeunes, des entrepreneurs, des demandeurs d’emploi … Nous 
sommes tous acteurs. Citéco sera à cet égard un lieu d’échanges, d’écoute, 
tout autant que d’explication, d’analyse et d’information.  
Un grand jour aussi pour tous ceux qui exercent la profession d’économiste et 
de pédagogues, sous toutes ses formes (chercheurs, enseignants, analystes, 
journalistes), et pour tous ceux que cette matière, à la fois scientifique et 
humaine, passionne. Citéco saura-t-elle devenir la maison des économistes ? 
En tout cas, ce sera un lieu ouvert au débat économique, un débat libre et 
crédible. 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Citéco est beaucoup plus qu’un musée, et n’a qu’un seul équivalent dans le 
monde, le MIDE [Museo Interactivo de Economica], à Mexico. Citéco se veut 
un lieu de culture scientifique, sur le modèle de la Cité des Sciences. Citéco 
vous incitera à toucher, manipuler, jouer…à être acteur de votre parcours de 
visite. Citéco, c’est aussi un lieu de culture et d’éducation avec pour thème 
l’économie, qui viendra en appui  non seulement des professeurs d’économie, 
mais aussi des enseignants de gestion, de mathématiques et d’histoire-
géographie. 
Quelques chiffres impressionnants vous permettront de saisir l’ampleur 
de cette réalisation : 6 700 m2 de surface totale dont  2 800 m2 dédiés aux 
expositions avec un parcours permanent structuré en 6 séquences : les 
échanges, les acteurs, les marchés, les instabilités, la régulation et les 
trésors ; 58 vidéos pour une durée cumulée de 6 heures ; 26 jeux multimédia 
individuels et collectifs ; 390 objets dont 44 prêtés par la Bibliothèque 
Nationale de  France; un budget d’investissement significatif mais maitrisé 
d’environ 50 MEUR – au regard de la restauration de ce patrimoine 
exceptionnel.  
Citéco, c’est également un site internet : citeco.fr. Le grand public pourra, 
grâce à ce portail dédié à la culture économique, préparer sa visite et 
découvrir, à distance, certaines animations et productions du musée. Grâce à 
l’appui des économistes de la Banque de France, le site mettra également à 
disposition  des ressources pédagogiques et des contenus numériques 
diversifiés et innovants. Je vous invite à les découvrir ! 
III. L’avenir, et l’ambition plus large d’éducation économique et 
financière 
Le monde économique et financier dans lequel nous vivons est techniquement 
complexe et évolutif. Est-ce une affaire de spécialistes ? Non : chacun de 
nous est amené au quotidien à prendre des décisions « financières », qu’il 
s’agisse de gérer son budget, d’épargner, de financer un achat, ou encore de 
préparer sa retraite. 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
C’est pourquoi  promouvoir l’éducation économique, budgétaire et financière 
des publics – ce que l’on appelle en résumé « l’éducation financière » –  
répond à un triple enjeu social, économique et démocratique. Des individus 
avertis en matière budgétaire et financière, y compris les familles en situation 
de fragilité, sont mieux à même de faire des choix adaptés à leurs intérêts. 
Des citoyens disposant des clés pour éclairer les débats économiques sont 
davantage en mesure de juger de leur pertinence. Il s’agit de mieux 
comprendre pour mieux décider. 
Face à ces attentes, les pouvoirs publics français ont mis en place depuis 
2016 une stratégie publique d’éducation économique, budgétaire et financière, 
à l’instar de nombreux pays de l’OCDE. Je sais, M. le Ministre, l’importance 
personnelle que vous attachez à ces questions de « culture économique ». 
Cette ambition est portée par des acteurs  publics – au premier rang desquels 
l’Éducation nationale –, associatifs et professionnels. La Banque de France a 
été désignée opérateur national, en charge de promouvoir et coordonner cette 
stratégie. En 2018, vous nous avez demandé, M. le Ministre, de l’étendre aux 
entrepreneurs, tout en confirmant l’engagement vers les particuliers. 
Avec l’Éducation nationale, avec les cinq associations [membres du Comité 
opérationnel], avec de multiples acteurs publics et privés, nous nous 
engageons, chacun avec nos spécificités, à renforcer les actions en direction 
des enseignants et des jeunes. Nous nous engageons également à poursuivre 
nos actions d’appui auprès des intervenants sociaux. Nous nous engageons à 
continuer à offrir à l’ensemble de nos concitoyens une information neutre, 
pédagogique, et gratuite, notamment avec le portail « 
Mesquestionsdargent.fr», site partenarial public qui vient compléter, de 
manière très concrète, citeco.fr.  
Ensemble, nous voulons réussir ce défi collectif : que chacun dispose des 
compétences économiques, budgétaire et financière de base lui permettant  
de prendre sur ces sujets des décisions, en indépendance et connaissance de 
cause.   
Page 6 sur 6 
 
C’est une ambition de longue haleine, c’est une ambition collective, c’est une 
ambition au service de la liberté de nos concitoyens. Mais si nous réussissons, 
ce 15 mai 2019 sera aussi un grand jour pour notre pays. Je souhaite longue 
vie à la Cité de l’Économie, aussi longue que celle de l’Hôtel Gaillard. Je vous 
remercie de votre attention.

Présentation du rapport d’activité 
de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution pour 2018 
  Conférence de presse du mardi 28 mai 2019 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France, 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution

Mesdames, Messieurs, 
[Slide 1] Je suis heureux de vous accueillir pour la présentation du rapport d’activité 2018 de 
l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR), avec Bernard Delas, vice-président 
de l’ACPR, Rémi Bouchez, président de la commission des sanctions, et Edouard 
Fernandez-Bollo, secrétaire général de l’ACPR. En 2018, les femmes et les hommes de 
l’ACPR ont continué d’œuvrer sans relâche pour la stabilité financière, dans un contexte 
marqué par l’incertitude – et parfois l’urgence – du Brexit. Je tiens à les en remercier. Ce 
matin, je centrerai mon propos sur une problématique d’actualité, celle de la rentabilité des 
banques et des compagnies d’assurance en France et en Europe [slide 2]. 
** 
 
I. Une rentabilité des banques et assurances françaises résiliente 
Le rendement des fonds propres des grandes banques françaises [return on equity - RoE] 
a progressé légèrement en 2018 de 0,4 point pour s’établir à 6,7 %, et retrouver ainsi son 
niveau de 2015. Cette rentabilité maintenue doit s’apprécier au regard de la forte croissance 
de leur niveau de capital. Les banques françaises ont renforcé leur solvabilité et sont 
aujourd’hui plus résistantes. Leurs fonds propres ont ainsi presque triplé depuis la crise. 
Parallèlement, leurs ratios de fonds propres durs (CET1) ont augmenté de près de huit 
points depuis 2008 passant de 5,8 % à 13,6 % en 2018 [slide 3].La rentabilité des banques 
françaises s’inscrit dans la moyenne de la zone euro, et est très supérieure à celle des 
banques allemandes. À l’échelle mondiale, seules les banques américaines se distinguent 
avec un RoE moyen supérieur à 10 %.  
Au cours des dix dernières années, les banques françaises ont accompli un chemin 
considérable dans un environnement économique, financier et règlementaire exigeant. Il faut 
donc se prémunir contre deux références trompeuses qui consisteraient d’une part 
à comparer les RoE actuels à ceux d’avant-crise – ils étaient clairement excessifs –,  et 
d’autre part à se focaliser sur l’indicateur du coût du capital (Cost of Equity). Il reste, dans le 
cas des banques européennes et françaises, apparemment excessivement élevé, à plus de 
9 %, contre moins de 7 % pour les banques américaines ; ce chiffre ne traduit ni le 
renforcement de leur solvabilité et donc de leur sécurité, ni la forte baisse des taux sans 
risques [slide 4]. 
S’agissant des assurances, le secteur reste solide. Le taux de couverture du capital de 
solvabilité des organismes devrait atteindre près de 240 % fin 2018, soit un niveau proche de 
celui de 2017. Mais je laisserai Bernard Delas revenir plus en détail sur le sujet.

II. Pour autant, une dynamique moins favorable qui appelle une mobilisation. 
 
2.1 Trois facteurs d’attention en dynamique 
Au-delà de la qualité de la photo 2018, la vue prospective – en dynamique – appelle 
vigilance et mobilisation. Trois facteurs d’attention pèsent en effet sur la rentabilité des 
banques françaises comme des banques européennes. Les deux premiers affectent avant 
tout la banque de détail : le maintien de taux bas et la digitalisation. Le maintien d’un 
environnement de taux bas est totalement justifié et nécessaire compte tenu de la situation 
économique en zone euro ; mais il contribue à réduire la marge nette d’intérêt des banques 
de détail qui se financent par des dépôts – et non à taux variable sur les marchés –, et le 
rendement des placements des assureurs. S’agissant plus spécifiquement des banques, il 
ne s’agit ni d’ignorer ce sujet, ni de l’enfler en en faisant l’explication unique en matière de 
rentabilité des banques en zone euro. Le Conseil des gouverneurs l’a dit explicitement le 10 
avril dernier « Dans le cadre de notre évaluation régulière, nous examinerons également si le 
maintien des retombées favorables des taux d’intérêt négatifs pour l’économie exige 
l’atténuation de leurs éventuels effets secondaires, le cas échéant, sur l’intermédiation 
bancaire » : laissons donc le temps de ce travail, puis de la décision éventuelle. Mais il serait 
exagéré de trouver ici l’explication unique : la politique monétaire a d’autres effets favorables 
pour les banques, dont la diminution du coût du risque et l’augmentation des volumes de 
prêts ; et certains systèmes bancaires, dans les pays nordiques notamment, ont de 
meilleures rentabilités avec des taux d’intérêt au moins aussi bas. 
Plus structurellement, les institutions financières – banques comme assurances – sont 
confrontées à un défi existentiel, celui de leur mutation digitale, qui révolutionne les usages 
et apporte beaucoup aux clients. L’adaptation à ce nouvel écosystème nécessite toutefois de 
gros investissements ; et entraine une pression à la baisse sur les revenus. Face à cette 
situation, les établissements financiers devront dégager de nouveaux gains de productivité et 
de nouveaux services personnalisés, en explorant encore plus les voies de l’automatisation 
et de l’intelligence artificielle (IA). L’ACPR travaille activement sur ces sujets. Après la 
publication d’un document de réflexion sur les enjeux de l’IA pour le secteur financier, le 
superviseur a lancé, en février dernier, un appel à candidature pour des ateliers de travail 
avec les acteurs du secteur financier. Trois processus clefs sont concernés : la LCB/FT, les 
modèles internes et la protection de la clientèle.    
Le troisième facteur d’attention concerne les banques d’investissement. En dix ans, les 
banques d’investissement européennes ont perdu, selon certaines estimations, dix points de 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
parts de marché au profit des banques américaines. Cette évolution s’explique, notamment, 
par la difficulté des banques européennes à atteindre une taille critique indispensable pour 
intervenir sur un marché mondial. Le Brexit ne devrait pas suffisamment modifier cette 
tendance si persiste la fragmentation du marché européen. A l’inverse, les banques 
d’investissement américaines sont portées par un très vaste marché intérieur, où les marges 
sont plus fortes. Leur taille est un atout décisif pour faire des économies d’échelle, et se 
positionner sur les financements de grande envergure. Face à ces défis structurels, les BFI 
des banques françaises ont déjà engagé un recentrage sur les métiers les plus rentables et 
mené des plans importants de réduction des coûts. Mais d’importants chantiers demeurent 
notamment en matière d’industrialisation des processus et des flux ; la digitalisation change 
aussi les métiers de trading. 
2.2 Trois mobilisations en conséquence pour les banques et les régulateurs 
Le renforcement de la rentabilité bancaire passe avant tout par des stratégies de 
restructuration dans chaque banque. Pour ce faire, les institutions bancaires disposent de 
plusieurs leviers d’action : l’innovation technologique, la maitrise des coûts ou encore la 
diversification des sources de revenus [slide 5]. De ce point de vue, je souligne la résilience 
du modèle français dit de banque « universelle » ou diversifiée. Combiner les trois métiers 
de banque de détail, de services financiers spécialisés, de banque de grande entreprise et 
de marché, développe les revenus croisés – le cross-selling – et atténue la sensibilité au 
cycle des taux d’intérêt, à travers la diversité des financements. À l’intérieur même de la 
banque de détail, la rentabilité a été mieux préservée grâce à l’accroissement des 
commissions générées par des activités indépendantes des taux d’intérêt : les services de 
paiements, la gestion d’actifs et le placement d’assurances. La marge nette d’intérêt des six 
principaux groupes bancaires français représente ainsi 44 % de leur résultat net contre 57 % 
de celui des banques de la zone euro. 
Le défi de la rentabilité bancaire appelle un autre impératif : la consolidation transfrontière 
qui permettrait à de véritables groupes bancaires pan-européens d’exercer plus efficacement 
leurs activités et, ainsi, de mieux faire face à la concurrence internationale. Comparé au 
marché américain, le secteur bancaire européen reste fragmenté : la part de marché des 5 
principales banques européennes s’élève à 20 % contre plus de 40 % aux États-Unis. Cet 
objectif relève en partie des pouvoirs publics : l’Union des marchés de capitaux doit enfin 
progresser concrètement, et l’Union bancaire doit être achevée dans un vrai marché unique 
bancaire. Il importe notamment de lutter contre les pratiques de « ring-fencing » qui sont 
autant d’obstacles à la mise en place d’une approche sur base consolidée pour la gestion de 
la liquidité et du capital. En cas de crise, ces politiques pourraient se révéler dangereuses en 
limitant la capacité des entités d’un groupe transfrontière à se soutenir mutuellement. Pour 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
autant, les acteurs privés n’ont pas besoin de tout attendre des pouvoirs publics avant de 
commencer à penser consolidation dans leurs stratégies. 
Enfin, il convient  d’assurer l’égalité de traitement des établissements face à la 
réglementation internationale. Pour y parvenir, deux conditions sont impératives. La 
transposition de Bâle III doit être raisonnable et tenir compte de l’application de « l’output 
floor » au plus haut niveau de consolidation. Cette transposition doit être surtout équitable et 
mise en œuvre de manière fidèle dans l’ensemble des juridictions, y compris les États-Unis. 
Je veux cependant être clair : la solution aux défis bancaires n’est pas la dérèglementation, 
mais l’innovation ; pas le retour en arrière – vers la crise financière –, mais l’élan en avant. 
 
 
III. Il nous faut rester totalement mobilisé sur deux risques mortels : la LCB-FT et 
la cybersécurité 
La lutte contre le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme (LCB-FT) appelle une 
mobilisation sans faille. Les 23 missions de contrôle conduites par l’ACPR ont révélé des 
carences significatives dans la mise en œuvre par les organismes assujettis de leurs 
obligations de LCB-FT et de gel des avoirs. En 2018, la commission des sanctions a 
prononcé neuf sanctions, dont une s’élevant à 50 millions d’euros. Parallèlement à 
l’évaluation de la France par le Groupe d’action financière en 2020, l’ACPR s’impliquera 
fortement dans la mise en place d’un dispositif de LCB-FT rénové et robuste à l’échelle 
européenne. J’ai toute confiance en l’Autorité bancaire européenne – qui s’installe à Paris le 
13 juin prochain – pour promouvoir une coopération efficace et des échanges d’informations 
fructueux entre les superviseurs nationaux. Edouard Fernandez-Bollo préside d’ailleurs le 
comité interne dédié à la LCB-FT au sein de l’Autorité bancaire européenne. La conférence 
de l’ACPR dont la matinée sera consacrée à la LCB-FT, qui se tiendra le 21 juin prochain, 
sera l’occasion de rappeler les efforts que nous devons tous poursuivre dans ce domaine. 
Enfin, l’ACPR et la Banque de France sont en première ligne des actions menées pour 
renforcer la cybersécurité du secteur financier, qui est une priorité de la présidence 
française du G7. Je rappelle que le secteur financier ne connait pas de menace plus certaine 
que celle des cyber-risques. Dans ce contexte d’urgence, nous allons mettre en œuvre des 
mesures concrètes prochainement. Je pense notamment à une « catégorisation » commune 
des cyber-incidents ou aux leçons à tirer du cyber stress-test G7 organisé début juin par la 
Banque de France.

L’économie française a l’atout d’un système financier solide, le plus solide de la zone euro : 
la France est leader dans des activités essentielles telles que l’assurance vie et non-vie et le 
secteur de la gestion d’actifs, et accueille quatre des huit banques d’importance systémique 
mondiale de la zone euro.  Et le superviseur européen peut s’appuyer sur l’expertise et 
l’expérience de l’ACPR, reconnues à Francfort et en Europe. Sachons jouer ces forces, dans 
le contexte du Brexit : sans complaisance aucune – le superviseur restera toujours vigilant, 
et aucun établissement n’ignore l’ampleur des défis –, mais avec notre intelligence collective.

Fondation Hanns Martin Schleyer 
Laudatio Prof. Dr. Dr. Clemens Fuest 
Stuttgart, le 6 mai 2019 
 
 
Discours de Sylvie Goulard 
Seconde sous-gouverneure de la Banque de France 
 
 
Version originale allemande 
Traduction 
Seul le prononcé fait foi 
 
 
Monsieur le Président de la République fédérale, 
Monsieur le Professeur Fuest (et chère famille Fuest), 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
 
Je voudrais tout d’abord remercier la fondation Hanns Martin Schleyer pour l’honneur qui 
m’est fait d’être associée à la remise de ce prix prestigieux au Professeur Clemens Fuest. 
 
Le fait surprenant n’est pas que Clemens Fuest, économiste respecté pour lequel j’ai la plus 
haute estime, reçoive ce prix, mais plutôt que je prononce son éloge. Aussi, j’imagine que 
vous ne vous attendez pas à une laudatio orthodoxe. 
 
Je me bornerai donc à rappeler brièvement – si tant est que cela soit possible – le très riche 
parcours du Professeur Fuest qui l’a mené de l’université de Bochum et de celle de 
 
2 
 
Mannheim à un doctorat à Cologne et à une habilitation à Munich. La variété des sujets que 
Clemens Fuest aborde ressort de ses nombreux travaux : il s’est penché dans sa thèse sur les 
questions économiques européennes pour ensuite consacrer son travail d’habilitation à la 
fiscalité et l’emploi. Elle ressort aussi de la succession des postes de professeur qu’il a 
occupés : à l’université de Cologne, à la Saïd Business School de l’université d’Oxford. Il a 
ensuite dirigé le Centre européen de recherche économique (ZEW) à Mannheim, avant de 
devenir, en 2016, Président de l’institut Ifo, position qu’il occupe encore aujourd’hui. Il 
enseigne en parallèle à l’université Ludwig-Maximilian à Munich. Et je ne mentionne pas les 
nombreux conseils scientifiques et autres organismes auxquels il appartient.  
 
Je n’insisterai pas longtemps sur les mérites du Professeur Fuest qui imprime sa marque 
depuis des années sur les débats économiques en Allemagne par ses nombreuses 
publications de recherche académique, ses articles de presse et ses interventions télévisées : 
le Frankfurter allgemeine Zeitung le cite tous les ans comme l’un des experts les plus 
influents d’Allemagne. 
 
Vous ne serez pas surpris que je me concentre sur l’influence européenne de Clemens Fuest. 
 
J’ai interrogé un certain nombre de ses collègues économistes. Je voudrais témoigner du 
respect qu’il suscite au sein des cercles académiques de toute l’Europe. Non seulement ses 
travaux se distinguent par leur grande rigueur intellectuelle mais le Professor Fuest est aussi 
apprécié parce qu’il « sait écouter », parce qu’il « cherche à comprendre les autres », ou 
encore parce qu’il a « l’esprit d’équipe ». Il est aussi apprécié parce qu’il est « fair-play » et 
qu’il argumente avec une honnêteté intellectuelle qui suppose une grande indépendance 
d’esprit. Depuis le début de la crise, certains universitaires ont eu tendance à prendre la 
parole en fonction du lieu d’où ils s’exprimaient. La nationalité marque de son sceau la 
plupart des esprits. Clemens Fuest est sans aucun doute possible un économiste allemand. 
Mais il évite de se considérer uniquement comme tel. Dans les panels auxquels nous avons 
pu participer ensemble, dans les papiers que j’ai lus pour préparer ce discours, j’ai toujours 
senti ce souci de rigueur et d’indépendance d’esprit. 
 
 
3 
 
Je citerai, à titre d’illustration, un sujet délicat : les excédents allemands (balance 
commerciale et des paiements). Je ne partage pas l’esprit dans lequel certains partenaires de 
l’Allemagne évoquent la question, sur le ton du reproche voire de l’envie. En revanche, je 
crois important que l’on puisse, au sein d’une union économique et monétaire, évoquer 
entre partenaires tous les effets, toutes les externalités sur les autres des politiques 
nationales. Clemens Fuest aborde le sujet sous un angle trop rare : il défend certes ses idées 
et doute même que les excédents aient un impact nocif, mais il rappelle néanmoins que 
l’Allemagne doit respecter les obligations posées par l’UE en termes de contrôle des 
déséquilibres macroéconomiques
1
. Cela peut paraître banal mais cela ne l’est pas. Cette 
vision européenne d’un problème européen commun le caractérise.  
 
Clemens Fuest a aussi contribué concrètement à jeter des ponts entre les différents pays de 
la zone euro. En 2013, il a participé activement aux travaux d’un groupe d’économistes, 
d’hommes politiques et de juristes allemands (Glienicker Gruppe). En 2018, il était l’un des 
quatorze économistes (7 d’Allemagne + 7 de France), qui ont rédigé ensemble un document 
commun contenant des propositions pour l’avenir de la zone euro
2
, en recherchant de 
délicats points d’équilibre sur des sujets tels que la discipline budgétaire ou la restructuration

Est-ce vraiment si important ? Oui, je le crois vraiment ; car pour lever les ambiguïtés et 
incompréhensions mutuelles, y compris entre la France et l’Allemagne, il faut aller plus en 
profondeur et s’astreindre à ces efforts collectifs. Malgré nombre de réflexions académiques 
et de rapports de l’UE (Blue print, Rapport des 4 présidents, Rapport des 5 présidents), nous 
n’avons pas suffisamment avancé au sein de l’Union économique et monétaire pour être sûrs 
de bien résister à une nouvelle crise financière.  
 
D’où viennent les difficultés ? Les premières années de l’euro ont produit une convergence 
des taux d’intérêt dont on a déduit hâtivement que les économies se rapprochaient, tout 
comme les esprits. Des erreurs de conception sont passées inaperçues. En outre, aux erreurs 
collectives se sont ajoutées des fautes commises par certains pays dans leur gestion.  
 
La crise a montré que certaines divergences politiques, mais surtout culturelles sont 
profondément enracinées. Une résurgence brutale de préjugés et autres stéréotypes n’a pas 
toujours contribué à traiter ces erreurs avec calme et méthode. Avec la crise, une certaine 
défiance mutuelle s’est installée, ce qui est dangereux.  
 
Clemens Fuest n’a jamais caché ses doutes sur les failles initiales de la construction de l’euro 
mais, prenant ses responsabilités, il a osé affirmer qu’une fois un tel projet lancé, on ne 
revient pas en arrière. Il ne néglige pas non plus les bénéfices que l’Allemagne tire du Marché 
unique et de l’euro. Cette honnêteté, ce courage méritent d’être salués. 
 
Les pères fondateurs de l’euro ont assurément travaillé avec les ambitions et les analyses de 
leur temps. Le chancelier Kohl, François Mitterrand et d’autres que je ne peux pas tous citer, 
étaient animés par des ambitions précises, à caractère politique. Ils ont réussi à arrimer les 
pays européens les uns aux autres ; au lieu de toujours voir ce qui n’a pas fonctionné, nous 
devrions nous féliciter que notre monnaie soit aussi stable et que cette construction, aussi 
originale soit-elle, ait résisté à la pire crise financière et budgétaire depuis 1945.  
 
C’est à notre génération de compléter le travail qui, dans l’esprit des pionniers, était bien 
censé être poursuivi. À cet égard, ne noircissons pas le tableau non plus : un fonds de secours 
 
5 
 
(MES) existe à présent, un superviseur unique des plus grandes banques de la zone euro, 
installé à Francfort, a été créé, pour ne citer que ces deux nouveautés des dernières années.  
 
Et malgré toutes les différences culturelles et l’extrême rigueur des mesures imposées aux 
populations du Sud de l’Europe, aucun pays n’est sorti de la zone euro. Selon 
l’Eurobaromètre de la Commission européenne, 70 % des Européens sont favorables à la 
monnaie commune, ils sont même 81 % en Allemagne, et l’opinion est devenue plus 
favorable en Italie ces derniers mois, même si le taux d’adhésion est plus bas. 
 
Au terme de cette crise, la situation du Portugal ou de l’Irlande, mais aussi celle de la Grèce, 
démontrent que le modèle s’est finalement imposé. Dans la douleur certes, mais la maison 
commune a tenu. 
 
Pouvons-nous nous satisfaire de cela ? Non.  
 
D’une part, les changements profonds que connaît le monde – surtout les changements 
climatique et technologique – exigent davantage de clairvoyance et moins de complaisance. 
Les défis mondiaux devraient bien davantage façonner l’intégration européenne. Nous 
serions bien avisés de regarder plus souvent au-delà de nos frontières nationales.  
 
D’autre part, tous les politiques et experts s’occupant d’économie et de la monnaie ont une 
responsabilité envers les citoyens : pour éviter d’en arriver de nouveau à des situations aussi 
lourdes de conséquences sociales, il est crucial d’approfondir nos réflexions communes et de 
prendre des décisions rapidement.  
 
Si nous sommes vraiment convaincus que nous ne partageons pas seulement une monnaie 
commune, mais aussi « une communauté de destin », alors le débat transfrontière mérite 
d’être amélioré et approfondi. Ce n’est certes pas facile dans un contexte de montée des 
nationalismes et d’absence de hauteur de vues. Le Professor Fuest joue ici un rôle décisif. 
 
 
6 
 
Je vais prendre l’exemple de l’économie sociale de marché pour montrer pourquoi nous 
avons besoin d’une discussion transfrontière approfondie qui n’a malheureusement pas lieu 
(ou du moins insuffisamment). 
 
Clemens Fuest a reçu l’an dernier le prix « Impulsrede zur Sozialen Marktwirtschaft ». Dans 
son remarquable exposé Soziale Marktwirtschaft: Exportschlager oder Auslaufmodell
4
 
présenté à cette occasion, il souligne que la « forte acceptation » du concept en Allemagne 
est peut-être liée à son caractère relativement « vague ».  
 
Le concept s’exporte malheureusement mal. Il a été introduit dans les traités européens (art 
3.3) : « L’Union établit un marché intérieur. Elle œuvre pour le développement durable de 
l’Europe fondé sur une croissance économique équilibrée et sur la stabilité des prix, une 
économie sociale de marché hautement compétitive, qui tend au plein emploi et au progrès 
social, (…). » 
 
Cette notion est hélas peu connue au-delà des frontières allemandes. J’ai souvent fait le test 
dans les milieux cultivés hors d’Allemagne : le plus souvent, le nom de Ludwig Erhard est 
connu et vaguement associé au « miracle économique allemand ». En dehors de l’Allemagne 
(et de l’Autriche), presque personne n’a entendu parler de Alfred Müller-Armack, Walter 
Eucken et de l’école de Fribourg. L’ordolibéralisme allemand est malheureusement souvent 
caricaturé en « ultralibéralisme » et en discipline excessive. 
 
C’est pourquoi les citoyens européens ont du mal à comprendre et à intérioriser un tel 
concept. Il serait donc utile d’expliquer au plus grand nombre, comme le Professeur Fuest le 
fait avec clarté, que « la compétitivité de l’économie et le contrôle de la concurrence 
augmentent le niveau de vie de larges couches de la population ».  
 
La compétitivité, la concurrence dans un monde digitalisé, la justice sociale, l’indépendance 
des banques centrales sont des sujets souvent débattus. Comme l’a exprimé Clemens Fuest :

Wirtschaftspolitischer Club Deutschland e.V, 11 septembre 2018

« L’importance d’un juste équilibre entre l’équité sociale et la compétitivité de l’économie de 
marché est actuellement au centre des débats de politique économique comme jamais 
auparavant ». Cet équilibre est décisif. 
 
Les Français, qui ont peur du libre jeu des forces du marché, apprécieraient davantage 
l’économie sociale de marché, s’ils savaient qu’elle est « orientée intentionnellement… plus 
précisément, orientée à des fins sociales»
5
. Cela vaut aussi pour l’Italie ou l’Espagne, où le 
chômage des jeunes reste fort élevé et où une part de la population a du mal à faire encore 
confiance à l’UE. 
 
D’où l’importance de se poser une question qui est en général passée sous silence : 
avons-nous correctement transposé le concept d’économie sociale de marché au niveau 
européen ? Tous les éléments qu’il contient en Allemagne – et qui contribuent au succès 
allemand – sont-ils présents dans l’UE ? La réponse est nuancée. 
 
<U+F0B7> Le cadre juridique, qui garantit la liberté de l’activité économique, existe depuis le 
début de l’intégration européenne (CECA / Communauté européenne – cf. les traités 
et le rôle de la Commission en tant que gardienne des traités sous le contrôle de la 
CJUE). 
 
<U+F0B7> La politique de la concurrence, qui joue un rôle central dans la théorie de l’économie 
sociale de marché, afin de faire bénéficier le consommateur de la croissance de la 
productivité, est depuis des décennies une caractéristique de l’UE ; la Commission a 
de nombreux pouvoirs dans ce domaine. Sous la direction ferme de Margrethe 
Vestager, elle est active, et elle l’est actuellement même davantage - d’après toutes 
les études récentes - que les autorités américaines. 
 
                                                          
5
 
Müller-Armack, cité par Fuest 
 
8 
 
<U+F0B7> La libre fixation des prix et la protection de la propriété privée sont garanties partout 
dans l’UE ; l’existence d’une économie de marché viable est même un critère 
d’adhésion pour de nouveaux États membres.  
 
<U+F0B7> Une banque centrale indépendante du pouvoir politique – la BCE – existe depuis 
Maastricht, et a son siège à Francfort. 
 
Plusieurs éléments du cadre allemand font toutefois défaut au niveau européen. 
 
<U+F0B7> Tout d’abord, il manque au niveau de la zone euro / de l’UE une force directrice 
politique permanente, démocratiquement légitimée. Le pilotage macro-économique 
consiste par conséquent en une coordination souple des gouvernements nationaux, 
avec plus ou moins de succès, pour rester diplomate. Bien sûr, chaque gouvernement 
de l’Union économique et monétaire doit « tenir sa maison en ordre » ; bien sûr, 
chacun doit assumer sa responsabilité. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que les objectifs 
communs de l’économie sociale de marché puissent ainsi être atteints. 
L’indépendance de la banque centrale n’a par exemple pas la même portée dans un 
tel contexte que dans un cadre étatique classique.  
 
<U+F0B7> Deuxième élément : la négociation collective libre n’existe pas dans tous les pays 
d’Europe. Mais surtout : il n’y a pas de codécision (« Mitbestimmung ») dans les 
entreprises au niveau européen, alors qu’en Allemagne un rôle plus actif est garanti 
aux salariés. 
 
<U+F0B7> Troisième élément : absence de politiques sociales actives que l’État peut mener pour 
corriger par exemple les disparités de revenu qui se produisent sur le marché. La 
formation, qui joue un rôle si crucial pour les jeunes en Allemagne et en Autriche, ne 
fait pas non plus partie du « paquet » de l’économie sociale de marché au niveau 
européen.  
 
Selon l’Agence fédérale pour l’éducation civique, l’économie sociale de marché inclut : 
 
9 
 
« une politique économique, conjoncturelle et fiscale active de l’État ainsi qu’un ensemble de 
prestations sociales, qui protège par exemple les personnes âgées, malades, aux faibles 
revenus ou au chômage de la précarité économique, quand elles ne peuvent pas subvenir à 
leurs propres besoins
6
. »  
 
Il ne s’agit évidemment pas de reprendre tous les éléments de l’économie sociale de marché 
allemande, à l’identique, au niveau européen, mais au moins de comprendre que le concept 
« économie sociale de marché » a perdu quelques éléments clés en route entre Fribourg et 
Bruxelles.  
 
Le rapport Werner, rédigé en 1970 dans la perspective de la création d’une monnaie 
commune, allait beaucoup plus loin que tout ce que l’on peut lire aujourd’hui. Il proposait un 
transfert de compétences dans le domaine de la politique économique et budgétaire, 
davantage de convergence fiscale et la responsabilité des autorités communes devant un 
Parlement. Il considérait qu’il était nécessaire de consulter les salariés et les employeurs afin 
de prévenir des divergences excessives. En comparaison, les discussions actuelles manquent 
un peu d’envergure et d’imagination. 
 
Faut-il s’étonner que tant de citoyens européens soient aujourd’hui suspicieux ou se sentent 
oubliés ? 
 
Quand nous parlons d’une « économie sociale de marché », quand nous affirmons que nous 
voulons augmenter ensemble le niveau de vie, alors nous devons tenir nos promesses en 
agissant tant au plan national qu’européen ou de la zone euro. En outre, si, au sein de l’UE, 
toutes les décisions relatives au marché sont prises à la majorité, mais celles qui pourraient 
faire avancer le social et la politique fiscale restent prises à l’unanimité – et par conséquent 
restent souvent en plan – nous ne devrions pas être si étonnés que le scepticisme augmente 
au sein de la population.

Dans un rapport rédigé pour la Commission européenne
7
, Mario Monti avait déjà, il y a dix 
ans, conseillé d’améliorer cet équilibre déjà évoqué précédemment. Les peurs légitimes des 
citoyens doivent être prises au sérieux et prises en compte afin d’obtenir leur adhésion 
pérenne à l’économie de marché (principalement par une meilleure convergence sociale et 
fiscale, associée à davantage de libéralisation, selon le rapport). 
  
Sinon, nous mettons en danger non seulement la stabilité de notre monnaie, mais aussi 
notre cohésion sociale. 
 
* 
 
Le malaise tient peut-être aussi à une utilisation inadéquate du concept de subsidiarité. La 
subsidiarité est certes incontournable dans une UE de presque 30 pays. 500 millions 
d’Européens ne peuvent pas être gouvernés de manière centralisée.  
Mais la répartition actuelle des compétences est tout sauf optimale. Nous agissons encore au 
niveau national dans des domaines où une action commune est nécessaire : dans les 
domaines de la sécurité traditionnelle, de la diplomatie ou encore de la cybersécurité et du 
changement climatique, nous pourrions être mieux armés et plus efficaces si nous agissions 
ensemble. Nous affirmons être souverains mais nous ne sommes pas même en mesure de 
sauvegarder un traité important avec l’Iran (sur la prolifération d’armes nucléaires), parce 
que les USA ont décidé unilatéralement de s’en retirer et d’appliquer des sanctions. Le 
renforcement du rôle international de l’euro pourrait améliorer notre indépendance 
stratégique.  
 
Il est fait usage de la subsidiarité, mais elle est peu prise en considération et elle est parfois 
instrumentalisée. Être proche des citoyens, c’est bien. Je crains cependant que ce concept de 
subsidiarité ne devienne dans certains cas un avatar politiquement correct du nationalisme. 
En s’abritant derrière la subsidiarité, on se donne bonne conscience pour ne rien faire 
d’européen et pour consolider dans le même temps les situations de rentes au niveau

national. Peu importe si le prix à payer est concrètement moins de sécurité, davantage de 
blanchiment d’argent ou moins de poids au niveau mondial. 
 
À cet égard, nous n’avons pas même réussi à construire un pont solide entre Allemands et 
Français. Pour un pays habitué à une répartition des compétences entre plusieurs niveaux de 
responsabilité comme l’Allemagne, le recours à la subsidiarité (et à une « multi level 
governance ») est plus naturel que dans un État fortement centralisé. En France, l’égalité des 
citoyens – où qu’ils vivent sur le territoire – est la valeur politique clé depuis 1789 : on 
enseigne les mêmes matières à l’école à Marseille et à Lille, et le salaire minimum est le 
même pour tous dans tout le pays. Tocqueville a écrit dans L’Ancien Régime et la révolution 
que la France est « une nation affolée d’égalité ». Je crains que cela ne soit toujours vrai. 
Cette approche est difficilement compatible avec celle de la subsidiarité qui implique que des 
différences importantes peuvent résulter de choix locaux.  
 
Réalité de l’économie sociale de marché, ambiguïtés de la subsidiarité, voilà deux exemples 
de difficultés fondamentales. Certains en Allemagne redoutent que tous les Européens 
escomptent des « transferts » d’argent allemand. Ce n’est pas à mon sens le ressort principal 
des attentes et interrogations qui existent dans les autres pays.  
 
Il est crucial de travailler sur ces désaccords, comme Clemens Fuest le fait souvent dans ses 
articles.  
 
Son article What a feeling ? How to promote European Identity ?
8
 est à cet égard 
particulièrement précieux. Il contient des propositions concrètes pour une participation 
personnelle des citoyens européens à la construction européenne, pour une meilleure 
information transfrontalière pour le rapprochement sans lequel les divergences fleurissent. 
 
La rigueur intellectuelle et le talent de passeur d’idées du Professeur Clemens Fuest sont très 
précieux dans un tel contexte. Nous n’arriverons à bâtir un sentiment d’appartenance, un

« Wir-Gefühl » - pour utiliser un de mes termes allemands préférés – que si des êtres 
humains en chair et en os font l’effort de réfléchir avec des partenaires pour proposer des 
solutions qui ne soient pas l’affirmation de leurs propres certitudes mais un authentique 
compromis entre des visions différentes. 
 
Ensuite, nous devrions nous rappeler que les fondateurs n’ont pas visé seulement la paix en 
Europe. Je sais bien qu’en Allemagne, comme aurait dit Helmut Schmidt, on envoie 
volontiers chez le médecin toute personne qui parle de « vision ». Mais nous avons besoin de 
redonner du sens à la démarche commune. Un exemple : le nouveau défi du traitement des 
données. Nous ne pouvons accepter le pillage des données personnelles à des fins de 
contrôle par un pouvoir autoritaire ou d’enrichissement d’un petit groupe d’individus. 
L’Europe, c’est autre chose qu’un business model à l’américaine ou une société autoritaire à 
la chinoise. 
 
L’incendie de Notre-Dame le 15 avril dernier nous a remis en mémoire que l’Europe, c’est 
plus que des traités et des institutions, aussi importants soient-ils. Ce qui importe, c’est 
l’esprit. Et nous négligeons trop souvent le rôle de l’art dans les émotions. Notre histoire, 
imprégnée de chrétienté et des Lumières, est importante. Ce soir là, j’ai reçu des dizaines de 
messages du monde entier, mais surtout d’Europe, de la part d’amis européens qui se 
sentaient personnellement concernés.  
 
Alors j’ai repensé à un discours de Paul-Henri Spaak à Strasbourg le 18 septembre 1954, au 
Conseil de l’Europe. Il m’est revenu en mémoire à cause de la référence aux cathédrales. Je 
vais en lire un extrait. Son texte est magnifique pour réfléchir à la guerre et à la paix. 
 
« (…) Et si vous en avez assez de ces souvenirs de batailles, je vous demande (…) de vous 
rendre compte qu’il y a quelque chose d’autre en Europe que les drapeaux déployés sur les 
champs couverts de morts, qu’il y a nos cathédrales qui dressent vers un même ciel leur 
appel vers un même Dieu, il y a nos peuples qui travaillent et qui souffrent et qui ont les 
mêmes intérêts et qui cherchent passionnément à la fois la paix et la prospérité qu’ils 
méritent. Il y a Descartes et il y a Goethe, il y a Kant et il y a Pasteur, il y a Beethoven (…).  
 
 
13 
 
Est-ce que vous ne vous rendez pas compte que nous sommes les hommes d’une même 
civilisation et, quelles que soient nos convictions personnelles et philosophiques, d’une 
même civilisation qui s’appelle la civilisation chrétienne et quand nous aurons tous disparu 
et qu’on ne pensera plus à aucun d’entre nous dans le recul du temps, on saura tout de 
même qu’ensemble, c’est cette aventure-là que nous avons vécue. 
 
Aujourd’hui, votre fameuse querelle séculaire franco-allemande, elle n’a plus beaucoup 
d’importance, excusez-moi de vous le dire, dans le grand conflit où, Français et Allemands, 
vous êtes du même côté de la barricade, dans le grand conflit qui aujourd’hui oppose l’Est 
à l’Ouest, dans le grand conflit où il s’agit de défendre non plus même un territoire sacré, 
mais de grandes idées, une civilisation commune, des règles morales et politiques 
communes et la même conception honorable de l’Homme. » 
 
Son discours faisait allusion à la guerre froide. Son message sur nos valeurs communes n’a 
rien perdu de son actualité !  
 
Aujourd’hui, la fondation Hanns Martin Schleyer m’a fait un beau cadeau. Car 
personnellement, je me suis toujours sentie du même côté que les Allemands de bonne 
volonté, du côté de la démocratie et de l’État de droit comme la Bundesrepublik a su les 
consolider de manière exemplaire depuis 1949, du côté du savoir scientifique et académique, 
du côté des Européens engagés et cultivés comme Clemens Fuest.  
 
Pour la promotion et la consolidation des fondements d’une communauté libérale, comme 
l’exprime le prix, nous avons encore beaucoup à faire.  
 
Merci Clemens pour tout ce que vous avez déjà réalisé. Nous continuons.

Actualité de la lutte contre le blanchiment des capitaux et le financement du 
terrorisme 
PALAIS BRONGNIART – Vendredi 21 juin 2019 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr).
Page 1 sur 5 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je vous souhaite avec Bernard Delas la bienvenue à cette journée organisée 
par l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) autour de deux 
temps forts : la matinée sera consacrée à la lutte contre le blanchiment et le 
financement du terrorisme (LCB-FT), et l’après-midi aux nouveaux risques et 
aux évolutions réglementaires en matière d’assurance. 
Oui, la prévention des risques de blanchiment et de terrorisme mobilise une 
part croissante de nos ressources à tous. Mais oui, l’actualité récente – qu’il 
s’agisse de l’aggravation de la menace terroriste depuis 2015 ou du 
blanchiment de capitaux dans des banques d’autres pays européens – nous 
montre dramatiquement qu’aucun d’entre nous ne peut ignorer ces risques. Ils 
peuvent miner nos démocraties, et plus directement saper la confiance dans le 
système financier et sa stabilité. Ces combats contre le blanchiment et le 
financement du terrorisme nous les menons au sein d’une communauté plus 
large dont les principaux acteurs publics sont présents aujourd’hui ; j’accueille 
à ce titre Didier BANQUY, président du Conseil d’orientation de la lutte contre 
le blanchiment et le financement du terrorisme (COLB), et Bruno DALLES, 
directeur de TRACFIN.  
Mais l’efficacité du dispositif de LCB-FT implique aussi la mobilisation sans 
faille des organismes financiers : l’ACPR fait preuve au plan national d’une 
exigence constante à leur égard (I). Puis, j’en viendrai à notre ambition pour 
renforcer le cadre européen en matière de LCB-FT (II).  
*** 
I. Des avancées significatives accomplies sous l’égide de l’ACPR 
Les institutions financières françaises se sont fortement mobilisées en matière 
de LCB-FT, et je tiens à le saluer. L’analyse des « questionnaires anti-
blanchiment », transmis à l’ACPR, révèle une amélioration significative du 
niveau de conformité de leur dispositif de LCB-FT. Par ailleurs, les 
établissements sont plus réactifs en matière de déclaration de soupçon 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
puisque le délai moyen de transmission des établissements bancaires s’est 
réduit de 97 à 62 jours entre 2016 et 2018.  
L’ACPR est reconnue pour être un superviseur exigeant. Les organismes 
financiers font l’objet de contrôles rigoureux selon le profil de risque de chaque 
entité.  Ainsi, pour la seule année 2018, l’ACPR a réalisé près de 
1 300 contrôles sur « pièces » et conduit 29 contrôles sur place (slide 1). Les 
contrôles réalisés ont débouché, en 2018, sur huit mises en demeure et sur 
neuf sanctions disciplinaires, marquées, cette année encore, par le 
renforcement du caractère dissuasif des sanctions pécuniaires. 
Pour autant, les contrôles et les sanctions ne sont pas suffisants à eux seuls. 
C’est pourquoi l’ACPR s’efforce d’enrichir son action par des mesures 
préventives d’accompagnement et de sensibilisation. Cette journée en est une 
illustration concrète. En étroite concertation avec les professionnels, l’ACPR a, 
ces derniers mois, publié ou mis à jour, avec la direction générale du Trésor et 
Tracfin, sept lignes directrices ou principes d’application sectoriels destinés à 
faciliter la mise en œuvre de la réglementation par les organismes financiers. 
Mais nous devons aller encore plus loin. Le recours aux techniques de 
l’intelligence artificielle, qui permet d’optimiser les outils de surveillance en 
matière de LCB-FT et de gel des avoirs, a donné lieu à des ateliers de travail 
conjoints avec les établissements volontaires, dont les résultats seront publiés 
d’ici la fin de l’année. 
Ce travail avec les établissements supervisés est d’autant plus nécessaire que  
les efforts pour renforcer les dispositifs LCB-FT doivent être poursuivis. Le 
caractère mouvant et protéiforme du risque de BC-FT appelle le maintien 
d’une mobilisation totale des institutions financières. Plusieurs axes sont au 
cœur de notre action et notamment :  
1/ Le pilotage du dispositif de LCB-FT de l’ensemble des groupes  avec 
une attention particulière pour les entités implantées dans des pays tiers.  
2/ Le respect des obligations en matière de gel des avoirs, qui reste une 
priorité de contrôle en 2019. 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
3/ Enfin, les prestataires de crypto actifs, dont la supervision du dispositif de 
LCB-FT vient d’être confiée à l’ACPR et à l’Autorité des Marchés Financiers 
par la loi PACTE. Je souligne à ce propos que nous venons, avec 
Bruno Le Maire et au nom de la présidence française du G7, de décider la 
mise en place d'une task-force sur les projets de ""stable coins"": le "" libra"", dont 
on a beaucoup parlé ces derniers jours, mais pas seulement lui. Au 
demeurant, ce terme de "" stable"" devra être précisé: stable contre quoi (si 
c'est un panier de devises, quel panier ?); et stable jusqu'à quel point (fixe, ou 
partiellement flexible ?). Dirigée par Benoit Coeuré avec des représentants 
des banques centrales, elle devra dans les prochains mois examiner les 
exigences anti-blanchiment, mais aussi celles de protection des 
consommateurs, de résilience opérationnelle, ainsi que les éventuelles 
questions de transmission de la politique monétaire. Nous voulons allier 
ouverture sur l'innovation et fermeté sur la régulation: c'est l'intérêt de tous. Et 
nous devons parallèlement améliorer encore l’efficacité des systèmes de 
paiement existants, en transfrontières : la Banque de France promeut 
activement une stratégie européenne en la matière. 
 
II. La nécessité de renforcer le dispositif de supervision européen 
Des (contre-)exemples récents et retentissants intervenus dans d’autres pays 
européens ont montré la nécessité de renforcer le dispositif de supervision 
européen. Nous devons donc viser une supervision efficace dans tous les 
États membres de l’UE, sans exception, car la LCB-FT est une chaîne dont la 
force dépend de chaque maillon. 
À court terme, et de manière tout à fait impérieuse, il nous faut favoriser les 
synergies entre supervision prudentielle et supervision du risque de BC-FT. 
L’ACPR, dont l’organisation est fondée sur la large polyvalence de ses 
contrôleurs tant en matière de risque prudentiel que de BC-FT, œuvre 
quotidiennement à ce rapprochement dans le cadre du Mécanisme de 
supervision unique de la BCE et de l’accord d’échange d’informations signé en 
janvier dernier. Par ailleurs, l’ACPR participe activement à la finalisation des 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
orientations européennes sur les collèges de supervision LCB-FT qui 
favoriseront la coopération avec les superviseurs prudentiels. Il nous faut 
toutefois aller plus loin dans l’harmonisation de nos pratiques de supervision 
prudentielle qui doivent davantage intégrer le risque de BC-FT. C’est 
l’ambition de la CRD V qui renforce les exigences en la matière. Je salue à ce 
titre l’engagement international et européen déterminant 
d’Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, qui préside les groupes de travail dédiés à la 
LCB-FT du Comité de Bâle comme de l’ABE, l’Autorité bancaire européenne 
installée à Paris depuis le début de ce mois.   
Car, et de manière plus structurelle, une gouvernance rénovée en matière de 
LCB-FT passe par le renforcement du rôle de l’Autorité Bancaire Européenne. 
Je salue la présence ici de Piers Haben, directeur à l’ABE. Chacun sait que la 
France aurait souhaité que la réforme des autorités européennes de 
surveillance aille plus loin, mais sachons saluer le verre à moitié plein, avec 
des pouvoirs accrus pour l’ABE en ce domaine. Les échanges d’informations 
sont renforcés grâce, notamment, à la mise en place d’une base de données 
européenne recensant les principales faiblesses constatées chez les 
organismes financiers en matière de BC-FT. Sur la base de ces éléments, 
l’ABE pourra par exemple enjoindre aux autorités de LCB-FT concernées de 
mener des investigations supplémentaires ou d’envisager des mesures 
correctrices. L’ABE pourra ici compter sur l’ACPR pour jouer le jeu du collectif 
européen et participer à la mise en œuvre du plan d’action confié à l’ABE par 
le Conseil. 
Mais il nous faut, je crois, être plus ambitieux et constituer un réseau fort de 
superviseurs européens en matière de LCB-FT réunissant l’ABE et les 
superviseurs nationaux. Dans ce cadre, le réseau conduit par l’ABE devrait 
avoir la capacité et les moyens humains, dans les cas les plus graves, de 
mener des actions conjointes d’urgence ou se substituer temporairement à un 
superviseur national dans les pays ou les secteurs les plus exposés aux 
risques de BC-FT, qui feraient ainsi l’objet d’une plus grande vigilance.

Cette solution nous parait plus efficace et plus rapide que la création d’une  
nouvelle agence unique européenne en charge de la LCB-FT. Le pragmatisme 
est de construire à partir des acquis existants : la LCB-FT s’inscrit dans un 
dispositif institutionnel et juridique marqué par des spécificités nationales, en 
interaction avec le renseignement financier ou le droit pénal, et qui fonctionne 
bien dans nombre de pays dont la France. 
*** 
Le 16 juillet 1989, la France, au côté des six pays du G7, créait le Groupe 
d’Action Financière (GAFI) lors du Sommet de l’Arche. Depuis 30 ans, la 
continuité nationale et internationale de notre engagement en matière de LCB-
FT est incontestable. Pour autant, les défis posés par le blanchiment des 
capitaux et le financement du terrorisme excèdent largement nos frontières. 
L’ABE sait qu’elle pourra compter sur notre détermination sans faille en la 
matière. Notre compétence est reconnue et entendue : tant mieux, mais cela 
ne justifie aucune complaisance ; jamais. Cela passe notamment par la 
réussite de notre évaluation par le GAFI en 2020. Nous allons donc travailler 
collectivement au sein de «l’équipe France » – constituée de l’ACPR en liaison 
étroite avec les autres acteurs publics et les organismes financiers – afin de 
préparer au mieux cette échéance. Aucun d’entre nous ne doit relâcher deux 
vertus ici cardinales : la compétence et la vigilance. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un grand plaisir de vous accueillir à cette conférence de haut niveau du 
G7 consacrée aux soixante-quinze prochaines années du système de Bretton 
Woods... ce qui est un signe de confiance. Il y a soixante-quinze ans, John 
Maynard Keynes pour la Grande-Bretagne, Harry Dexter White pour les États-
Unis et Pierre Mendès-France pour la France ont inauguré ce que nous 
considérons aujourd’hui comme « l’âge d’or » du multilatéralisme et de la 
coopération. Fait remarquable, la conférence de Bretton Woods a précédé la 
paix : la coopération économique était vue comme une condition préalable à la 
paix. Aujourd’hui, nous sommes malheureusement bien loin de cet esprit : le 
multilatéralisme est confronté à une crise majeure. Pourtant, les institutions de 
Bretton Woods sont remarquablement résilientes, grâce à l’engagement de 
leurs dirigeants successifs – nombre d’entre eux sont présents – et à la force 
de leur histoire. Ce sont là des atouts irremplaçables – nous en sommes 
probablement tous convaincus. Mais nous savons également que la situation 
actuelle n’est pas stable. Dès lors, vers quoi nous dirigeons-nous ? Le 
scénario le plus pessimiste serait une implosion du système, impliquant un 
réel retour en arrière, avec une montée du protectionnisme et du bilatéralisme. 
Un scénario plus prometteur – celui pour lequel nous devons nous battre – 
consisterait à sortir renforcés de cette crise en reconstruisant des solutions 
communes. Nous avons, dans le cadre des institutions de Bretton Woods, 
remporté deux succès. Mais chacun d’eux apporte aujourd’hui deux défis : 
- Nous avons, grâce à la coopération internationale et au FMI, bien répondu 
à la Grande crise financière. Mais aujourd’hui, nous sommes challengés 
sur les politiques monétaires  et sur la préservation de la stabilité 
financière. 
- Nous avons, avec la Banque mondiale et le FMI, bien accompagné le 
prodigieux développement de la mondialisation. Mais aujourd’hui, nous 
sommes confrontés au défi de la remise en cause du libre-échange, et de 
l’aspiration à d’autres « biens publics mondiaux » – à commencer par le 
changement climatique et l’inclusion sociale.

A. Deux défis après avoir géré la Grande crise financière 
I. Les politiques monétaires, dix ans après 
Personne n’en doute : les politiques monétaires ont joué un rôle décisif pour 
dépasser la Grande crise financière, grâce à deux grandes différences par 
rapport aux années 1930, les innovations et la coopération. Pour autant, elles 
sont aujourd’hui remises en question, « par le haut » – on leur demande 
toujours plus – ou « par le bas » – on critique le maintien des taux bas et de 
politiques non conventionnelles. 
Il me semble d’autant plus important de redire aujourd’hui trois principes : 
- Les politiques monétaires ne peuvent pas tout faire, et en particulier pas de 
miracles. Elles ne peuvent pas réparer les dégâts des incertitudes 
protectionnistes ; elles ne peuvent pas remplacer les réformes pour la 
croissance de long terme, ni des politiques budgétaires plus favorables à la 
croissance. 
- Les politiques monétaires des grandes économies avancées sont guidées 
par leur seul mandat domestique : la stabilité des prix et une gestion 
contracyclique de la demande. Elles ne visent pas les taux de change. 
C’est le paradoxe fécond des dernières années : c’est la coexistence des 
politiques axées sur le niveau national qui donne un équilibre monétaire 
concerté à l’échelle mondiale. 
-  Et à cette fin, la politique monétaire doit être conduite en toute 
indépendance. Celle des pouvoirs politiques, bien sûr, et on regrette de 
devoir le redire. Mais aussi l’indépendance vis-à-vis des pressions court-
termistes ou des intérêts économiques particuliers quels qu’ils soient. Ainsi, 
nous tenons compte des indications des marchés, mais nous ne devons 
pas être dépendants des marchés ;  cela suppose de ne pas s’appuyer trop 
exclusivement sur les données de marché pour évaluer les anticipations 
d’inflation. Nous sommes dépendants des données et je le dis en particulier 
pour la BCE : nous évaluerons dans nos prochains Conseils des 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
gouverneurs les données économiques réelles, et nous agirons en 
conséquence, le cas échéant, quand cela sera nécessaire.  
 
 
II. Les questions de stabilité financière et les crises 
En matière de stabilité financière, le système de Bretton Woods a traversé de 
nombreuses perturbations et crises depuis ses débuts, y compris un quasi-
éclatement en 1971. Et dix ans après la Grande crise financière, il nous 
appartient encore de définir l’avenir de notre système monétaire international 
actuel, ou « non-système », comme beaucoup le décrivent. 
Aujourd’hui, nous débattrons des risques pour la stabilité financière découlant 
de la croissance des flux transfrontières et des actifs financiers. Au cours de 
ces dernières années, les mouvements de capitaux internationaux ont été trop 
abondants dans les périodes favorables, capables d’alimenter des bulles 
domestiques et de déstabiliser les systèmes financiers nationaux, mais 
également susceptibles d’interruptions brutales (sudden stops) en période 
défavorable. L’accroissement exponentiel des effets de contagion par le biais 
des flux et des encours transfrontaliers, mais aussi la volatilité des prix des 
actifs, a conduit à une évolution de la position du FMI concernant les flux de 
capitaux, depuis sa doctrine initiale de libéralisation vers  une vision 
institutionnelle plus pragmatique.  
Surtout, nous devons améliorer les instruments de prévention des crises et 
éviter les prises de risques excessives. Notre première ligne de défense pour 
traiter les questions de stabilité financière doit être constituée de politiques 
macroéconomiques, prudentielles et structurelles saines. C’est la raison 
pour laquelle il est si important de renforcer la surveillance bilatérale et 
multilatérale du FMI. 
Mais la prévention ne peut jamais couvrir l’ensemble des risques. Le filet 
de sécurité financière mondial (Global Financial Safety Net – GFSN) a été 
renforcé ces dernières années, grâce à l’accroissement de la capacité du FMI 
– dont les ressources totales s’élèvent à quelque 1 300 milliards de dollars, et 
doivent au moins être maintenues à l’avenir –, au développement des accords 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
de financement régionaux en Europe et en Asie, et aux réseaux d’accords de 
swap entre banques centrales. Mais le GFSN est encore imparfait quant à sa 
couverture, et sa taille est insuffisante : les ressources totales du FMI ont 
chuté de 4 % des passifs extérieurs mondiaux en 1980 à moins de 1 % ces 
dernières années 
i
. Par ailleurs, la coordination entre les différentes strates du 
GFSN devrait être plus efficace en cas de crise systémique. Il est possible 
d’améliorer l’utilisation des instruments de précaution et de protéger les tiers 
dont la situation est saine sans accroitre l’aléa moral, comme le suggère en 
particulier le rapport du groupe de personnalités éminentes du G20 sur la 
gouvernance financière mondiale. 
 
B. Deux nouveaux défis après l’extension de la mondialisation 
I. Le commerce international et les IDE 
Je vais maintenant vous parler du commerce international et des 
investissements directs étrangers (IDE). Au fil du temps, l’intégration des 
échanges commerciaux et des IDE a contribué à la croissance de la 
productivité et à la prospérité. Mais de fortes distorsions du système 
commercial international demeurent, comme le montrent les importants 
déséquilibres mondiaux. Ils sont liés, par exemple, au modèle de croissance 
axé sur les exportations en Asie et aux régimes de taux de change 
administrés dans la plupart des pays émergents, les questions commerciales 
s’étant imbriquées avec d’autres sujets de préoccupation : les inégalités 
croissantes, les dommages environnementaux, la sécurité, etc. Ces 
problèmes sont réels et expliquent en partie la résurgence du 
protectionnisme ; mais le protectionnisme ne résout aucun de ces problèmes. 
Le bilatéralisme ne peut résoudre les déséquilibres bilatéraux et encore moins 
les déséquilibres mondiaux.  
Un multilatéralisme renouvelé doit être plus efficace, de trois manières au 
moins. Premièrement, à propos des échanges commerciaux, le G20 a 
reconnu – en principe – qu’il était nécessaire d’agir pour améliorer le 
fonctionnement de l’OMC. Il faut maintenant réaliser des progrès concrets sur 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
un programme de réformes, en particulier s’agissant du mécanisme de 
règlement des différends. L’OMC doit renforcer et élargir la clause de la nation 
la plus favorisée et continuer de soutenir fermement la libéralisation des 
échanges, y compris dans le secteur des services, dans lequel il y a du 
retard. Deuxièmement, nous devons mieux comprendre et affronter les 
déséquilibres mondiaux. Avec un niveau de 40 % du PIB mondial, les 
déséquilibres mondiaux – mesurés par la somme des valeurs absolues des 
positions extérieures nettes créditrices et débitrices – atteignent aujourd’hui un 
pic historique et sont quatre fois supérieurs à leur niveau des années 1990. Et 
troisièmement, nous devons prendre en compte des nouveaux biens publics 
dans les accords internationaux.  
 
II. Biens publics mondiaux et développement 
Les biens publics mondiaux – notamment le climat et l’inclusion sociale – sont 
une source de préoccupation pour tous : politiquement, ils créent des attentes 
croissantes et économiquement, ils génèrent des externalités. La fourniture 
insuffisante de ces biens peut exercer des effets perturbateurs considérables 
sur les systèmes économiques, financiers et sociaux, entraînant d’importants 
coûts sociaux et ce, de façon encore plus prononcée dans les pays en 
développement. Soyons francs : nous avons sous-estimé ces attentes, trop 
longtemps. Le « consensus de Washington » était économiquement solide, et 
socialement trop faible. Rien de durable ne se fait sans une économie solide, 
donc tenons ferme sur ce mandat. Mais la mondialisation a été souvent 
ressentie comme ayant essentiellement profité aux grandes sociétés – et à 
leur évasion fiscale – et aux classes aisées, mobiles à l’international – et à la 
croissance rapide de leurs revenus. Les inégalités entre pays – dont le Nord et 
le Sud – ont heureusement diminué, celles à l’intérieur des pays ont 
augmenté. Et les jeunes générations exigent que nous garantissions la 
protection de la planète.  
Beaucoup a été fait au cours des dernières années. Par exemple, les 
institutions de Bretton Woods ont contribué à réduire significativement la 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
pauvreté au plan mondial : depuis 1990, le nombre de personnes en situation 
de pauvreté extrême dans le monde a diminué de 1,1 milliard. Mais beaucoup 
reste à faire. À cet égard, les institutions de Bretton Woods peuvent jouer un 
rôle clé en se concentrant sur leurs compétences essentielles, – à savoir la 
surveillance, l’assistance technique et le prêt –, et en développant de 
nouveaux outils pour l’analyse de problèmes macrocritiques tels que le 
changement climatique, la transition  numérique et les inégalités. Nous devons 
avoir pour objectif une meilleure coordination entre les institutions de Bretton 
Woods et les autres organisations internationales, y compris les instances des 
Nations unies (Programme des Nations unies pour le développement, 
Conférence des Nations unies sur le changement climatique, Conférence des 
Nations unies sur le commerce et le développement...). Compte tenu du 
développement économique encore insuffisant en Afrique et dans une partie 
de l’Asie du Sud, il convient de revoir le fonctionnement de l’aide au 
développement. Nous pourrions dire la même chose concernant le 
changement climatique, une coordination plus forte entre les institutions des 
Nations unies et celles de Bretton Woods pourrait être réalisée, ces dernières 
fournissant le cadre macrofinancier nécessaire à l’évaluation des risques et 
des politiques économiques, à l’exemple du NGFS. 
** 
Permettez-moi de conclure par les paroles prophétiques prononcées par le 
Président Roosevelt lors de son discours inaugural à la conférence de Bretton 
Woods, en 1944 : « Les maladies économiques sont très contagieuses [et] la 
santé économique de chaque pays est un sujet de préoccupation réel pour 
tous ses voisins, proches comme éloignés ; [c’est pour cette raison que] ce 
que nous devons faire doit être fait – ne peut être fait – que de concert. » La 
plupart d’entre nous en conviennent tout à fait : le monde d’aujourd’hui a 
besoin d’une nouvelle harmonie et non de la dissonance de cette cacophonie 
incontrôlée. Cela devrait constituer un principe directeur pour les 75 années à 
venir. Dans cet esprit, je suis très impatient de voir les résultats de nos 
discussions aujourd’hui. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un grand plaisir d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui. Le sujet que vous m’avez 
demandé d’aborder – « Le rôle du secteur bancaire dans une économie 
mondiale soutenable » – nous invite à réfléchir à l’avenir. Permettez-moi, 
toutefois, de dire quelques mots du présent. Le contexte actuel est caractérisé 
par une incertitude accrue, qui pèse déjà sur la croissance au niveau 
international. Deux menaces y contribuent : en premier lieu, les tensions 
commerciales en provenance des États-Unis et ensuite, bien entendu, le 
Brexit. Il va sans dire que cette situation n’est pas durable. C’est aux 
politiciens, davantage qu’aux banquiers centraux, qu’il incombe de rétablir la 
confiance. Le dernier exemple de cette incertitude est la montée des prix du 
pétrole après l’attaque de samedi dernier sur les infrastructures pétrolières 
saoudiennes. Il est trop tôt pour en tirer des conclusions hâtives ; nous devons 
surveiller étroitement les conséquences sur le marché du pétrole qui est 
caractérisé par une offre relativement flexible et une demande modérée. Le 
prix du pétrole a nettement baissé depuis juin, d’environ 20 %. S’il se 
prolonge, le dernier choc pétrolier pourrait augmenter l’inflation et entraver la 
croissance. Aujourd’hui, dans ma présentation je commencerai brièvement par 
évoquer le Brexit avant d’aborder deux défis pour demain qui nous sont 
communs : la transformation digitale et la finance verte.   
** 
I. La perspective du Brexit et l’avenir de notre relation 
Permettez-moi de dire d’emblée que le Brexit est, et demeure, une mauvaise 
nouvelle, non seulement pour le Royaume-Uni, mais également pour l’Europe. 
Cependant nous respectons le choix des Britanniques quel qu’il soit. À ce 
stade, vous Britanniques et nous Européens faisons face à une grande 
incertitude quant au résultat. Nous espérons toujours un accord, mais nous 
devons être prêts pour une sortie sans accord avec tous les risques que cela 
comporte. Les superviseurs, au niveau national comme au niveau européen, 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
ont encouragé et suivi la mise en œuvre des plans de contingence par le 
secteur financier : de notre côté, nous sommes prêts.  
Permettez-moi d’ajouter un mot sur les futures relations entre le Royaume-Uni 
et l’Union européenne. Après le Brexit, nous ne ferons bien évidemment plus 
partie du même club européen, mais nous resterons, je l’espère, des 
partenaires et des amis proches. Le Royaume-Uni continuera de participer à 
des forums internationaux – tels que le G7, le G20, le CSF, la BRI, etc. – dans 
lesquels la coopération sera indispensable pour relever nos défis communs 
tels que la stabilité financière, le numérique et la réglementation des Bigtechs, 
ainsi que le défi de la finance verte. Dans un contexte où l’ordre multilatéral 
est menacé, permettez-moi d’exprimer le souhait que le Royaume-Uni et 
l’Union européenne s’efforceront véritablement de renouveler le 
multilatéralisme. De ce côté-ci de la Manche notre réponse collective au Brexit 
sera vraisemblablement une intégration plus poussée de l’Europe, avec une 
nouvelle Commission prometteuse sous l’égide d’Ursula von der Leyen, plutôt 
que l’isolationnisme ou la paralysie. L’Europe doit s’appuyer sur ses principaux 
acquis : l’euro qui célèbre son 20e anniversaire cette année, le marché unique 
et son modèle social et environnemental partagé. 
 
II. Prendre avec lucidité le virage numérique 
J’en viens à présent aux défis communs que nous partageons. Le numérique 
bouscule notre façon de vivre et de consommer, et ouvre aux entreprises et 
aux consommateurs tout un monde de possibilités. À l’échelle mondiale, il 
représente clairement à la fois une opportunité et un défi pour les banques, 
comme pour les superviseurs.  
De nouveaux entrants prennent de plus en plus d’importance. Les Fintechs 
ne disposent pas de ressources en capital suffisantes pour déstabiliser les 
banques traditionnelles, qui peuvent même les acquérir. Les Bigtechs, en 
revanche, disposent du potentiel nécessaire pour redéfinir fondamentalement 
l’intermédiation financière : elles bénéficient d’une forte image de marque, 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
d’une clientèle mondiale et d’un accès privilégié aux nouvelles technologies. 
Ce nouveau contexte représente un défi majeur pour les régulateurs et les 
superviseurs. Bien entendu, la réglementation financière doit demeurer 
technologiquement neutre : le principe fondamental « même activité, mêmes 
règles » doit continuer de s’appliquer, et on peut s’en féliciter au nom de 
l’égalité de traitement entre acteurs. Toutefois, au-delà de la réglementation 
financière traditionnelle, la coopération internationale doit être développée 
dans quatre domaines, les quatre pierres angulaires de la réglementation de la 
finance digitale. Premièrement, la cybersécurité est la condition sine qua non 
d’un avenir digital sûr et pérenne. Elle a clairement constitué une priorité de la 
présidence française du G7 cette année. Deuxièmement, s’agissant de la 
protection des données, les superviseurs financiers et les autorités chargées 
du respect de la vie privée doivent inventer de nouveaux modes de 
coopération pour traiter les questions relatives aux données qui sont devenues 
centrales pour les services financiers. Troisièmement, en ce qui concerne la 
concurrence et les politiques anti-trust, les situations dans lesquelles un 
acteur est le grand gagnant (the winner takes most) tout en restant en dehors 
du champ de la régulation financière doivent être anticipées et traitées de 
façon adéquate. Et quatrièmement, une juste taxation, grâce, espèrons-le, 
aux travaux de l’OCDE.  
Les projets de crypto-monnaies stables (stable coins), notamment le Libra 
de Facebook, en sont un bon exemple. Les crypto-monnaies stables sont 
relativement différentes des actifs spéculatifs tels que les Bitcoins. Au niveau 
mondial, les régulateurs devront toutefois rester très vigilants et croyez-moi, 
nous le serons. Lors de leur réunion à Chantilly en juillet, les membres du G7 
ont affirmé une position claire : les projets de crypto-monnaies stables 
soulèvent un défi en termes de souveraineté et « de graves préoccupations 
tant réglementaires que systémiques, ainsi que des enjeux de politiques 
publiques, qui doivent tous être traités avant que ces projets ne puissent être 
mis en œuvre» i. Dans le cadre de sa présidence du G7 cette année, dès que 
le projet a été annoncé par Facebook, la France a créé un groupe de travail 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
dédié. Le groupe de travail, présidé par Benoît Cœuré, publiera ses 
conclusions et fera des recommandations en octobre. Nous visons une 
réponse commune à l’ensemble des juridictions et qui englobe toutes les 
questions. Parmi les nombreuses exigences, j’en citerai seulement deux : les 
risques étant renforcés par l’anonymat des utilisateurs, il est impératif que ces 
projets respectent les réglementations anti-blanchiment. En outre, si les 
émetteurs de crypto-monnaies stables souhaitent également offrir des 
services bancaires, tels que dépôts, placements financiers et crédits, alors ils 
devront obtenir une licence bancaire dans chacun des pays où ils opèreront. 
Sinon, ces activités seraient illégales.  
Les projets de crypto-monnaies stables mettent en évidence les failles des 
systèmes de paiement transfrontières existants. Ainsi, au niveau européen, 
nous devons avoir pour objectif de promouvoir une véritable stratégie 
européenne pour les paiements de détail. Les paiements ne constituent 
plus une pure opération technique fastidieuse de back-office. Ils sont 
innovants et fournissent deux actifs stratégiques : des données et une relation 
client quotidienne. Mais, la triste réalité c’est que le marché européen des 
paiements est déjà dominé par des acteurs non européens. De plus, le rôle 
croissant des entreprises digitales non européennes – qu’elles soient 
américaines ou chinoises – dans l’offre de solutions de paiement doit être pris 
au sérieux. Malgré la créativité de l’écosystème européen des paiements, 
notre marché reste trop fragmenté. Il ne nous reste plus beaucoup de temps. 
Nous, Eurosystème et Banque de France, appelons à la création de solutions 
de paiement paneuropéennes, capitalisant sur une marque commune et sur 
un paiement instantané de pointe tel que l’infrastructure du service de 
règlement des paiements instantanés TARGET (Target Instant Payment 
Settlement - TIPS) géré par l’Eurosystème, et contribuant à des paiements 
internationaux nettement plus efficients, y compris pour les virements.  
Certains suggèrent aussi que la bonne réponse au Libra est d’accélérer la 
création d’une monnaie digitale de banque centrale (MDBC). C’est une idée 
brillante, mais un sujet séparé. Nous banques centrales devons étudier les 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
différentes questions que cela soulève – et nous avons commencé le travail à 
la Banque de France –, et ensuite décider en fonction des mérites propres à 
ces monnaies.  
 
III. La finance verte, « une nouvelle frontière pour le XXIe siècle » 
J’en viens maintenant à la question de la finance verte. Pour moi, il s’agit 
d’« une nouvelle frontière pour le XXIe siècle ». Tout d’abord, je voudrais 
rendre hommage à mon collègue et ami Mark Carney, gouverneur de la 
Banque d’Angleterre, qui a été pionnier en évoquant la « tragédie de 
l’horizon »ii en 2015. De nombreux progrès ont été accomplis depuis.  
Nous assistons actuellement à une prise de conscience croissante des 
risques liés au climat de la part des banques centrales, des superviseurs et 
des institutions financières. Clairement, la finance verte et la gestion des 
risques climatiques sont passées du « nice to have » au « must have », de 
l’émotion à la raison. Dans les institutions financières, le changement 
climatique n’est plus cantonné à la responsabilité sociale d’entreprise (RSE). 
En ce qui concerne les banques centrales et les superviseurs, la création du 
Réseau des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du 
système financier (NGFS) à Paris en décembre 2017 a représenté une 
avancée décisive. En 18 mois, cette coalition des volontés est passée de 
huit membres fondateurs à près de de 50 membres et observateurs issus des 
cinq continents, la Banque de France en assurant le secrétariat permanent et 
la Banque d’Angleterre y participant de façon active. Cette dynamique a une 
signification importante : les superviseurs et les banquiers centraux ont 
reconnu collectivement que les risques liés au changement climatique sont 
une source de risque financier à long terme. En avril 2019, dans son premier 
rapport détaillé, le NGFS a émis quatre recommandations pour les banques 
centrales et les superviseurs et deux recommandations supplémentaires à 
l’attention des décideurs politiques.  
Page 6 sur 7 
 
Pour la voie à suivre, je vois trois priorités à court terme. Premièrement, nous 
devons nous aurons besoin d’une publication d’informations (disclosure) 
enrichie reposant sur des taxonomies solides. La taxonomie publiée par le 
groupe d’experts de haut niveau sur la finance durable de la Commission 
européenne le 18 juin représente une avancée encourageante. 
Deuxièmement, nous devons mieux anticiper les risques à long terme liés au 
climat, grâce à ce que j’appelle la « vidéo des risques ». Nous devons 
promouvoir l’élaboration de tests de résistance climatiques (climate stress 
tests) complets afin de construire une approche prospective des effets des 
risques climatiques. Troisièmement, la finance verte doit gagner en maturité et 
rehausser ses normes professionnelles. Les besoins de financement au titre 
de la transition énergétique sont énormes ; rien qu’en Europe, on estime qu’il 
faudrait 177 milliards d’euros supplémentaires par an sur la période 
2021-2030 pour atteindre les objectifs de l’UE en matière d’énergie et de 
climat pour 2030 iii. La norme européenne sur les obligations vertes proposée 
par le groupe d’experts de la Commission européenne devrait, en définitive, 
contribuer à la poursuite du développement du marché des obligations vertes 
et permettre de canaliser un plus grand nombre d’investissements vers les 
projets verts.  
En outre, de nombreuses propositions ont été faites afin de permettre à la 
politique monétaire de jouer un rôle direct et ciblé sur certains secteurs dans 
le financement de la transition vers une économie à faible émission de 
carbone. Par exemple, certains appellent à un « assouplissement quantitatif 
vert » (« green quantitative easing »), avec l’introduction d’un biais en faveur 
d’actifs verts dans le cadre du programme d’achats d’actifs. En dépit de son 
apparente simplicité, cette proposition est quelque peu partielle et présente 
certaines limites : la politique monétaire vise un objectif macroéconomique 
(l’inflation) et ne distingue pas d’objectifs sociaux ou sectoriels spécifiques ; en 
outre, effectuer des achats massifs dans un gisement peu profond 
d’obligations vertes pourrait entraîner de graves distorsions sur le marché. Je 
préfère une approche plus « intégrée » et holistique – et, donc, plus 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
ambitieuse, en cohérence avec nos mandats de stabilité financière et de 
politique monétaire. C’est ce que j’ai souligné dans la dernière édition de la 
Revue de la stabilité financière de la Banque de France en juin iv. Le 
changement climatique est source de risque financier, mais il peut également 
entraîner des tensions à la hausse sur les prix en même temps qu’un 
ralentissement de l’activité – et, par conséquent, générer un choc 
stagflationniste sur le long terme. Les banques centrales doivent donc activer 
deux outils principaux dont elles disposent. Premièrement, il est primordial 
qu’elles contribuent à l’effort collectif de recherche afin de mieux comprendre 
et anticiper les effets économiques du changement climatique, et même 
qu’elles les intègrent dans leurs modèles macroéconomiques. Deuxièmement, 
en termes opérationnels, cela implique d’intégrer les résultats des risques liés 
au changement climatique à l’évaluation du collatéral. Il faut pour cela 
développer une méthodologie robuste afin d’évaluer avec précision l’impact du 
changement climatique sur le risque de crédit des actifs éligibles.

Permettez-moi de conclure par une conviction forte : ces défis de demain que 
nous partageons nécessitent une action immédiate de notre part aujourd’hui. 
Le philosophe politique Thomas Paine avait déclaré: « S’il doit y avoir la 
guerre, qu’elle ait lieu de mon temps afin que mon enfant puisse vivre en 
paix ». Espérons qu’au-delà du Brexit, nous trouverons des raisons 
communes de construire un avenir désirable pour les prochaines générations. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Monsieur le Directeur, Monsieur le Doyen [cher Enrico],  
Mesdames et Messieurs les Professeurs, chers étudiants,  
Je suis heureux de m’exprimer devant vous aujourd’hui. Je succède à 
plusieurs ministres des Affaires étrangères, y compris Jean-Yves Le Drian et 
Nathalie Loiseau. Caro Enrico, merci de ton invitation, je suis d’autant plus 
reconnaissant et honoré ! Cette alternance des diplomates vers le banquier 
central que je suis envoie peut-être trois signaux. Premièrement, rarement 
géopolitique et économie ont été aussi liées. Face à la montée des tensions 
protectionnistes et aux escalades verbales, accentuées hélas encore cet été, 
certains estiment même que seule l’interdépendance économique – « les doux 
liens du commerce » chers à Montesquieu – nous protège encore d’un conflit 
militaire. À l’inverse en tout cas, rarement un ralentissement économique 
global aura eu aussi clairement qu’aujourd’hui des causes politiques : presque 
partout, l’instabilité et l’incertitude publiques augmentent, et diminuent la 
confiance privée ; j’y reviendrai. 
Deuxième signal : rarement les banques centrales ont été autant sollicitées. Je 
ne vais pas vous infliger une leçon sur les délices et subtilités techniques de la 
politique monétaire. Disons juste que nous avons un objectif central – la 
stabilité des prix – et un instrument principal pour y parvenir – le taux d’intérêt 
de court terme. Mais depuis dix ans, et la grande crise financière, nous 
recourons à de nouveaux instruments : l'assouplissement quantitatif (le 
« QE »), la forward guidancei et même les taux négatifs. Ces politiques non 
conventionnelles ont été efficaces ; elles peuvent cependant créer – à tort – 
l’illusion de la toute-puissance monétaire.  
Troisième signal : rarement l’Europe est apparue à la fois aussi nécessaire et 
aussi divisée. Je suis un responsable français et européen, j’étais à Maastricht 
il y a 28 ans pour lancer l’euro ; je participe tous les 15 jours au Conseil des 
gouverneurs de la BCE qui le gère. J’assume cette conviction européenne, et 
celle que le travail commun entre la France et l’Allemagne est un moteur 
indispensable, même s’il n’est pas suffisant. Il y a presque 30 ans, la chute du 
Page 2 sur 10 
 
mur de Berlin insufflait un nouvel élan à la construction européenne. 
Aujourd’hui, l’Europe est en repli, sur la défensive. Pourtant, elle doit 
impérativement se faire entendre, face aux menaces qu’elle affronte, et le faire 
d’une seule voix sauf à être inaudible. Mais après les menaces, je voudrais au 
risque du paradoxe, voire d’une dose de provocation, développer devant vous 
une opportunité : dans la crise actuelle de la mondialisation, l’Europe n’a pas à 
raser les murs ; elle a à affirmer et proposer un modèle, son modèle social, 
environnemental et multilatéral. Je vous proposerai de le faire dans l’esprit de 
Stefan Zweig, qui dès 1934 décrivait admirablement l’état d’esprit du grand 
Européen que fut Érasme de Rotterdam : «  Au lieu d’écouter les vaines 
prétentions des roitelets, des sectateurs et des égoïsmes nationaux, la 
mission de l’Européen est au contraire de toujours insister sur ce qui lie et ce 
qui unit les peuples»ii 
** 
I. Être lucide face à deux menaces économiques 
Deux grands types de défis menacent aujourd’hui la souveraineté économique 
européenne : les premiers sont liés aux décisions politiques (« man-made ») ; 
les seconds aux puissances technologiques qui émergent en dehors des États 
(« tech-made »). En tête des menaces d’ordre politique figurent les tensions 
protectionnistes nées aux États-Unis, mais aussi autour du Brexit. Elles pèsent 
sur l’ordre multilatéral et contribuent déjà au ralentissement économique 
mondialiii : en un an, la prévision de croissance mondiale pour 2019 est 
passée de 3,9 % à 3,2 %, et celle pour la zone euro de 1,8 % à 1,1 %iv. Ces 
pertes de croissance sont intervenues avant même la hausse des tarifs, et ce 
pour une raison souvent sous-estimée : l’incertitude protectionniste réduit la 
confiance des entrepreneurs dans l’avenir, et les conduit donc à différer leurs 
investissements. La Grande-Bretagne du Brexit illustre ce déficit de confiance 
privée depuis trois ans [la Banque d’Angleterre estime que l’investissement 
des entreprises y est 20 à 25 % inférieur à sa tendance antérieure], et même 
les États-Unis commencent à en souffrir. Face à cette situation, les dirigeants 
Page 3 sur 10 
 
politiques – et l’un d’entre eux en particulier – ont le premier rôle: c’est à eux 
qu’il revient de rétablir la confiance qu’ils ont abîmée. Les politiques 
monétaires font leur devoir en maintenant des taux bas face à ce 
ralentissement, mais elles ne peuvent pas en soigner la cause.  
Pour la zone euro, ces incertitudes sont assorties d’un paradoxe pénible : les 
causes du ralentissement lui sont largement extérieures, mais elle est très 
sensiblement impactée. Ce décalage tient au poids spécifique de l’Allemagne, 
très spécialisée dans l’industrie des biens d’investissement et « surexposée » 
au commerce mondial. Il illustre néanmoins aussi le fait que l’Europe devrait 
mieux mobiliser ses marges de réaction : alors qu’elle a moins de dette 
publique (81 % du PIB) que les États-Unis (106 %) ou le Royaume-Uni [87 %], 
elle utilise moins l’arme de la relance budgétaire, notamment en Allemagne.  
En outre, le développement du rôle international de l’euro pourrait utilement 
consolider notre souveraineté économique. L’euro a vingt ans et c’est notre 
réussite : il s’est installé à la deuxième place du système monétaire 
international, mais il doit encore gagner en importance internationale. Le dollar 
reste un véritable atout de la puissance américaine et la Chine se soucie 
davantage de l’internationalisation du Renminbi.  
 
L’autre grand défi pour la souveraineté européenne est technologique. Des 
grandes entreprises numériques dont la puissance égale celle des États – les 
GAFA et autres « Bigtechs » –, aucune n’est européenne. Et l’Europe accuse 
un retard important d’investissement : en 2015, le stock de capital en 
technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) de la zone euro 
représente 7,6 % du PIB contre 10,9 % aux États-Unisv. L’Europe a pourtant 
l’atout du marché unique : on le voit en creux avec le Brexit, et le coût d’un « 
no deal » pour l’économie britannique. Mais il faut le jouer avec moins de 
timidité. Aller au bout de l’effet taille : il y a encore trop de frontières implicites 
et de fragmentation. Utiliser le pouvoir normatif, notamment pour orienter les 
innovations : c’est l’exemple du RGPD et des données où l’Europe prend le 
Page 4 sur 10 
 
lead. Oser une politique industrielle avec des partenariats publics-privés, 
comme sur l’Intelligence artificielle et les batteries. Et enfin mobiliser nos 
ressources financières : l’Europe est le premier réservoir d’épargne privée du 
monde, avec plus de 300 Mds d’excédent d’épargne investi chaque année à 
l’extérieur, mais notre capital-risque et plus largement les fonds propres de 
nos entreprises sont sous-développés par rapport aux États-Unis. 
En ce qui concerne le secteur financier, les « Bigtechs » sont susceptibles de 
provoquer un véritable « Big Bang » : elles bénéficient d’une forte image de 
marque, d’une clientèle mondiale et d’un accès privilégié aux nouvelles 
technologies. La réglementation financière doit bien sûr rester neutre vis-à-vis 
de la technologie : le principe « même activité, mêmes règles » doit 
s’appliquer pour préserver l’égalité de traitement entre acteurs. Mais, la 
coopération internationale doit être développée dans quatre domaines clés de 
la réglementation de la finance digitale : (i) la cybersécurité ; (ii) la protection 
des données ; (iii) une concurrence préservée face au risque de réseaux ultra-
dominants, et de monopoles privés ; (iv) et une juste taxation transfrontière. Le 
Libra de Facebook est un bon exemple où la coopération est impérative. Le 
G7 sous présidence française en a souligné l’enjeu de souveraineté, et 
souhaite régler des « questions sérieuses d’ordre règlementaire et 
systémique »vi avant toute mise en œuvre de ces projets.  
 
II. Être audacieux sur l’opportunité d’un modèle social, environnemental 
et multilatéral.  
J’en viens à ma provocation, ou plutôt à ce qui devrait être notre audace. A ce 
monde incertain, bouleversé, disruptif, et peu coopératif, l’Europe n’a-t-elle 
rien à proposer ? Partons des critiques mêmes adressées aujourd’hui à l’ordre 
multilatéral économique, et à ce qu’on a appelé le « consensus de Washington 
». Il était économiquement sain, mais socialement trop faible. La 
mondialisation a été souvent ressentie comme ayant essentiellement profité 
aux grandes entreprises – et à leur évasion fiscale. Les inégalités entre pays – 
Page 5 sur 10 
 
notamment entre le Nord et le Sud – ont heureusement diminué, celles à 
l’intérieur des pays ont augmenté. Et votre génération exige que nous 
garantissions la protection de la planète. Derrière ces critiques, il y a souvent 
nos valeurs mêmes européennes.  
Ceci fait écho aux travaux de nombreux chercheurs qui mettent en évidence la 
diversité des modèles de capitalisme et cherchent à en corriger les excèsvii. Je 
pense notamment à Marie-Laure Djelic, co-doyenne de l’École de 
management de Sciences Poviii, à Michel Aglietta qui dénonce les « dérives du 
capitalisme financier »ix ou encore à Dani Rodrik qui met en avant les 
dysfonctionnements du capitalisme libéralx. Au début des années 90, Michel 
Albert avait théorisé le « capitalisme rhénan »xi. Jean-Dominique Sénard 
appelle aujourd’hui l’Europe à un « capitalisme responsable ».  
L’Europe, si elle l’ose, est bien placée pour apporter des réponses concrètes 
aux attentes des citoyens du monde. La nouvelle Commission, autour d’Ursula 
von der Leyen, a les moyens de cette ambition. Le « modèle européen » 
s’articule à mes yeux autour de quatre exigences : la lutte contre les 
inégalités, la promotion de l’autonomie personnelle grâce à l’éducation et la 
connaissance, la préservation du climat, et la refondation du multilatéralisme. 
Au passage, je parle bien ici d’un « modèle européen » et non d’un « mode de 
vie européen » dont on discute beaucoup des derniers jours. Bref, l’Europe 
peut avec plus de fierté se définir par un modèle social, environnemental et 
multilatéral.  
2.1 Le modèle social : la lutte contre les inégalités  
La montée des inégalités est redevenue – heureusement, à mes yeux – un 
enjeu économique et social majeur, comme en témoignent le succès des 
travaux de Joseph Stiglitzxii et Thomas Pikettyxiii. Ce problème trop longtemps 
refoulé est au cœur des résultats électoraux – de Donald Trump au Brexit – ; il 
est une des clés de la crise démocratique et de la montée des « populismes ». 
Sur le plan économique, les institutions internationales, l’OCDExiv et le FMIxv, 
ont étudié l’impact des inégalités sur la croissance. Leur constat est clair : des 
inégalités persistantes réduisent le potentiel de croissance de long terme des 
Page 6 sur 10 
 
économies. Selon certaines estimations de l’OCDE, aux États-Unis et au 
Royaume-Uni, la hausse du PIB par tête entre 1990 et 2010 aurait été 
supérieure de 20 % si les inégalités de revenu n’avaient pas progressé.  
Ici, le modèle européen est riche d’enseignements. Tout d’abord parce qu’il 
est moins inégalitaire, via la redistribution notamment. Selon le Laboratoire 
sur les inégalités mondiales, après redistribution, en moyenne, les ménages 
faisant partie des 10 % les plus riches aux États-Unis ont un revenu douze fois 
supérieur à celui des 50 % les plus pauvres alors que ce ratio est à huit en 
Europe. Ce ratio a doublé aux États-Unis depuis 1980 alors qu’il est resté 
relativement stable en Europexvi. La protection sociale y joue un rôle 
essentiel : elle définit même l’Europe, qu’elle soit d’origine bismarkienne ou 
beveridgienne. Ensuite, le modèle européen organise les relations du travail 
et les rapports de force économique de manière plus équilibrée entre 
employeurs et salariés. La Charte des droits fondamentaux de l’Union 
européenne le consacre, qu’on soit ensuite dans des traditions nordiques via 
la négociation ou latines via la règlementation. Enfin, un haut niveau de 
services publics reste un facteur central d’intégration, des transports à la 
santé.  Sur le niveau des dépenses publiques, il y a des différences 
importantes entre pays européens : la France en a malheureusement le 
niveau le plus lourd avec 56 % du PIB, et doit rendre sa sphère publique plus 
efficace. Mais la moyenne de la zone euro, avec 47 % illustre un choix de 
société différent des États-Unis (35 %) ou du Royaume-Uni (38 %), et a fortiori 
des grands pays émergents.  
Redistribution et protection sociale + relations du travail + services publics : 
appelons cela modèle social européen, ou « Soziale Marktwirtschaft » si on 
est allemand et plus libéral. La grande majorité de nos concitoyens, au-delà de 
leurs différences nationales ou politiques, tient à cette matrice commune. 
Affirmons-le, sans honte : ce n’est pas seulement un héritage du passé, c’est 
un atout, aujourd’hui. Mais reconnaissons que cette ambition de justice sociale 
n’est plus suffisante. On ne peut se contenter d’une « réparation » ex-post des 
inégalitésxvii. C’est ex ante qu’il faut augmenter l’égalité des chances pour 
Page 7 sur 10 
 
tous, et c’est la deuxième exigence, celle de l’autonomie personnelle par 
l’éducation.  
2.2 L’exigence majeure : l’aspiration à l’autonomie par l’éducation  
La priorité absolue à l’éducation est claire : offrir à chaque citoyen les mêmes 
opportunités de réussite, et ce indépendamment de son origine sociale. Elle 
est la meilleure préparation de chacun à l’économie de la connaissance et aux 
ruptures technologiques qu’il devra affronter. Elle est la première condition de 
la mobilité sociale, pour réduire les inégalités « longitudinales » entre 
générations. Et ainsi, elle augmente la croissance en accroissant le « capital 
humain » d’un pays.  
Nous, Européens, avons parmi les meilleurs systèmes d’école et de formation 
professionnelle. Que l’on pense aux performances de la méthode éducative 
finlandaise ou à la qualité de l’apprentissage allemand ou suisse. Les 
compétences des élèves européens sont en moyenne supérieures à ceux des 
pays de l’OCDExviii qu’il s’agisse des scores en mathématiques, sciences ou 
compréhension de l’écrit. En plus d’être plus performants, nos systèmes 
éducatifs sont plus démocratiques grâce à des taux de scolarisation plus 
élevésxix – 90 % en Europe contre 84 % aux États-Unisxx – et des frais de 
scolarité en moyenne plus faiblesxxi.  
Mais à l’évidence, en matière d’éducation, il existe un gros écart Nord-Sud en 
Europe ; et la France – il faut bien le dire – est « sudiste » et inégalitaire. Les  
études PISA montrent que la France est le pays le pays du G7 où les 
performances éducatives des élèves sont le plus déterminées par leur 
environnement social
xxiii
xxii. Ce constat illustre le « délit d’initié » exposé par le 
prix Nobel d’économie Jean Tirole . Cet échec collectif contribue aussi à un 
taux de chômage structurel encore trop élevé en France, de l’ordre de 7 à 
8 %. Ce défi est commun au Sud de l’Europe, et se double d’un autre : 
développer enfin l’apprentissage et la formation professionnelle. Il y a 
aujourd’hui moins de jeunes en apprentissage en France, Italie et Espagne 
réunies que dans la seule Allemagne... alors qu’il y a beaucoup plus de 
Page 8 sur 10 
 
jeunes, et de jeunes au chômage. Ce n’est pas un paradoxe, c’est une 
explication… et un appel à l’action. La loi « Avenir Pro » votée en France en 
2018 doit être maintenant mise en œuvre, et la sortie de la stagnation 
économique en Italie passe aussi par ce chemin. 
2.3 L’engagement pour l’environnement et le climat 
La troisième exigence du modèle européen, c’est un engagement résolu en 
faveur de l’environnement et du climat. Cette question est aujourd’hui le plus 
grand ciment de la jeunesse – et au-delà – partout. Les dernières élections 
européennes l’ont bien montré. Le philosophe allemand Hans Jonas nous 
enjoint ici au principe responsabilité : prendre en compte la menace du pire 
pour agirxxiv. Et là, c’est l’Europe qui est en avance et c’est l’Amérique de D. 
Trump qui est en retard.  
Mais le climat est l’exemple même d’un bien public mondial : aucun pays n’a ni 
moyen, ni même intérêt à agir seul. Tous les pays européens ont signé 
l’Accord de Paris pour le Climat en 2015. Les superviseurs et les banques 
centrales ne sont pas en reste. En décembre 2017, certains d’entre eux – dont 
plusieurs pays européens – ont créé à l’initiative de la Banque de France le 
Réseau des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du 
système financier (NGFS). Aujourd’hui, ce réseau compte près de 50 
membres : il travaille concrètement – et avec beaucoup d’enthousiasme – à 
une meilleure intégration par les banques et assurances des risques liés au 
changement climatique, et en faveur des financements verts. Et nous devons, 
comme Christine Lagarde l’a dit au Parlement européen, intégrer le 
changement climatique dans la politique monétaire : j’ai fait des propositions 
en ce sens. 
2.4 Un nouveau modèle pour rénover le multilatéralisme 
La construction européenne repose avant tout sur une méthode : le 
multilatéralisme et la coopération.  Ce ne sont plus des mots très à la mode 
actuellement, mais portons-les sans faiblir. Face aux grandes questions des 
citoyens, les surenchères nationalistes n’apportent pas de solution. Encore 
Page 9 sur 10 
 
faut-il refonder le multilatéralisme sur trois convictions nourries de notre 
expérience européenne, avec ses limites : 
- un agenda correspondant aux attentes des peuples : une croissance 
plus inclusive, et la protection des biens publics communs à commencer 
par le climat, 
- une capacité à décider et agir jusqu’au bout sur quelques projets bien 
identifiés, plutôt qu’à discuter de tout, et trop longuement.  
- une distinction entre l’indépendance des États – qui peut être formelle – 
et la souveraineté réelle sur des sujets-clés. Emmanuel Macron a osé 
parmi les premiers revendiquer une « souveraineté européenne » : 
oxymore encore, pour beaucoup qui ne rêvent de souveraineté que 
nationale. Mais c’est cette souveraineté commune que Mario Draghi a 
mise en avant dans un discours à Bologne en février dernier, en 
soulignant que : « l’indépendance ne garantit pas la souveraineté » et 
que « les pays doivent travailler ensemble pour exercer leur 
souveraineté.»xxv Permettez-moi un témoignage : c’est ce que nous 
avons réussi avec l’euro. Ce n’est jamais facile – nous avons des 
différences de culture y compris économique. Mais nous avons la fierté 
d’avoir construit ensemble une monnaie souveraine, respectée sur la 
scène mondiale, avec le soutien populaire – 76 % des citoyens tiennent 
à l’euro –, et une institution fédérale – l’Eurosystème, constitué de la 
BCE et des 19 Banques centrales nationales – qui est sans doute celle 
qui marche le mieux en Europe.  
** 
Un modèle social, environnemental et multilatéral : tel est le message que 
l’Europe doit porter aujourd’hui dans le monde. Je n’en mésestime aucune des 
difficultés : il faut d’abord gérer les menaces de l’heure. Il faut associer et 
convaincre les peuples, qui craignent trop souvent que plus d’intégration 
économique ne menace leur modèle social européen, alors qu’au contraire 
elle le renforcerait : disons beaucoup plus clairement notre engagement sur 
Page 10 sur 10 
 
ces « fondamentaux » communs. Il faut enfin que nous osions affirmer nos 
valeurs à l’extérieur. Mais je conclurai avec une ancienne élève de Sciences-
Po, et une des plus grandes, Simone Veil : « Se fixant de grandes ambitions, 
l'Europe pourra faire entendre sa voix et défendre des valeurs fortes : la paix, 
la défense des droits de l'homme, davantage de solidarité entre les riches et 
les pauvres. »xxvi Ce combat-là vaut d’être mené ; c’est le mien, et je crois 
surtout que c’est celui de votre génération. À chacune et chacun de vous, 
bonne chance.

Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un réel plaisir de vous accueillir à l’occasion du 10e anniversaire de la 
Chaire Banque de France/PSE. Tous les anniversaires méritent d’être 
célébrés, mais le partenariat durable entre la Banque de France et la Paris 
School of Economics constitue une raison particulière de se réjouir. Au cours 
de la dernière décennie, il a montré comment la recherche académique et 
l’élaboration de la politique économique pouvaient se renforcer mutuellement. 
Au cours des dix dernières années, grâce à leur interaction, beaucoup a été 
accompli afin que notre environnement financier soit mieux à même de 
maîtriser les excès financiers. Cela nous a permis d’introduire plusieurs 
nouveaux instruments non conventionnels pour mettre en œuvre la politique 
monétaire. Mais ces changements ont également fait naître de nouvelles 
questions et de nouvelles incertitudes, qui nécessitent une poursuite des 
recherches académiques. Aussi, je souhaiterais évoquer plus en détail deux 
défis qui se présentent actuellement : la conduite de la politique monétaire 
dans notre environnement économique actuel et l’interaction entre politique 
monétaire et stabilité financière. 
** 
1. La politique monétaire face à de nouveaux défis 
 
1.1. Un environnement nouveau appelant des réponses nouvelles 
Ces nouvelles incertitudes apparaissent à un moment où l’environnement 
économique mondial est lui-même devenu de plus en plus incertain. À court 
terme, nombre des incertitudes qui assombrissent les perspectives 
économiques – en particulier dans le secteur manufacturier – sont d’origine 
humaine (« man-made ») – et elles sont même le fait d’un seul homme. Les 
événements qui, il n’y a pas si longtemps, apparaissaient comme des risques 
extrêmes, tels que la possibilité d’une intensification des tensions 
commerciales ou un Brexit sans accord, sont devenus des menaces 
imminentes. 
Page 2 sur 13 
 
Mais l’incertitude s’inscrit également dans des tendances structurelles de long 
terme. Les dix années écoulées depuis la crise financière ont vu l’économie 
mondiale se redresser progressivement. Mais elle n’est pas revenue à son 
niveau d’avant-crise. Les taux d’intérêt demeurent historiquement bas, en 
raison du niveau historiquement bas du taux d’intérêt naturel R* ii.  
À court terme, cette analyse – l’incertitude comme premier déclencheur du 
ralentissement actuel – devrait nous permettre de hiérarchiser nos réponses 
de politique économique. La politique monétaire a son rôle à jouer mais elle ne 
peut pas – moins que jamais – tout faire. Elle ne devrait même pas être la 
première à être sollicitée. Les gouvernements devraient être les premiers à 
réagir aux incertitudes qu’ils ont eux-mêmes fait naître, en éliminant les 
menaces qu’ils ont eux-mêmes fait peser sur la croissance mondiale. 
À défaut, une deuxième réponse consiste à faire intervenir la politique 
budgétaire. Une relance budgétaire par les pays disposant de marges de 
manœuvre pour le faire stimulerait la demande agrégée et, associée à  des 
investissements ciblés et de qualité, accentuerait dans le même temps la 
croissance à long terme iii . Les hausses de salaires dans les pays qui 
pratiquent depuis longtemps la modération salariale pourraient également 
contribuer à stimuler la demande agrégée et l’inflation. Et les réformes 
favorisant la croissance feraient augmenter R*.  
La politique monétaire apporte une troisième réponse. Au cours des dix 
dernières années, la politique monétaire de la BCE, sous la présidence de 
Mario Draghi, a, sans aucun doute, apporté une contribution décisive non 
seulement à la sauvegarde de l’euro en 2012, mais également à la reprise 
économique significative observée dans la zone euro depuis 2013. Au cours 
de cette période, plus de 10 millions d’emplois ont été créés. On estime que 
nos mesures non conventionnelles ont augmenté la croissance et l’inflation de 
près de 2 points de pourcentage entre 2016 et 2020. Comme je m’adresse à 
un public de chercheurs, je dois bien sûr souligner le fait que ces chiffres sont 
entourés d’incertitude.  
Page 3 sur 13 
 
Les décisions de politique monétaire les plus récentes du Conseil des 
gouverneurs ont toutefois suscité de nombreux commentaires. Je me suis 
donné comme règle de conduite de ne pas réagir à chaud. Deux semaines 
plus tard, je dirais simplement que j’ai soutenu de nombreux éléments du 
paquet de mesures, notamment le renforcement de la forward guidance 
dépendant de la situation économique (« state-dependent ») et l’introduction 
bienvenue d’un mécanisme d’atténuation (« tiering system ») semblable à 
celui existant dans toutes les autres juridictions où les taux d’intérêt sont 
négatifs. Mais, à ce stade, je n’étais pas favorable à la reprise des achats nets 
d’actifs, car je pensais que la poursuite des achats ne s’imposait pas 
immédiatement, étant donné les très bas niveaux des taux d’intérêt de long 
terme ainsi que des primes de terme, qui ont encore nettement diminué depuis 
que nous avons interrompu les achats nets en décembre dernier. Le QE a 
pour objectif principal d’extraire davantage le risque de duration sur le marché 
obligataire ; or les primes de terme ont déjà été comprimées avec succès – on 
estime que la prime de terme sur l’OIS à dix ans est nettement négative, 
comprise entre – 60 bp et – 100 bp environ.  
Je pense également que le renforcement significatif de notre forward 
guidance, la prolongation en conséquence de la période des 
réinvestissements du stock très important d’actifs du QE – 2 600 milliards 
d’euros –, et la réduction du taux de la facilité de dépôt constituent déjà une 
combinaison puissante et cohérente. La forward guidance indique désormais 
que nous prévoyons que les taux demeureront à leurs niveaux actuels, ou à 
des niveaux plus bas, jusqu’à ce que les perspectives d’inflation convergent 
durablement vers un niveau suffisamment proche de, mais inférieur à 2 %, et 
que cette convergence se reflète de manière cohérente dans la dynamique de 
l’inflation sous-jacente : notre forward guidance est désormais fortement 
dépendante de la situation économique (« state-based »), ce qui reflète notre 
engagement renforcé vers la réalisation de notre objectif. Cela constitue un 
progrès significatif qui a été éclipsé par les débats au sujet du QE. 
Page 4 sur 13 
 
À mes yeux, la question n’est pas celle d’une modification de l’équilibre entre 
faucons et colombes – je n’ai jamais considéré que cette classification 
ornithologique était d’une grande aide pour élaborer la politique monétaire. 
C’est une question d’analyse économique pragmatique et objective, qui 
considère les anticipations de marché comme des indicateurs utiles mais ne 
dépend pas d’elles. 
Mais quel qu’ait été le débat au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs, tournons-
nous à présent vers l’avenir, et soulignons un message simple qui fait 
l’unanimité : la politique monétaire a, une fois de plus, fait son devoir. Il 
appartient désormais à d’autres décideurs de faire le leur, à commencer par 
les autorités budgétaires. Comme l’a souligné hier Mario Draghi devant le 
Parlement européen, « nous avons besoin d’une stratégie économique 
cohérente dans la zone euro, qui complète et renforce l’efficacité de la 
politique monétaire ».  
1.2 Les défis spécifiques à la politique monétaire 
Ce n’est toutefois pas un appel à l’autosatisfaction : nous devons travailler sur 
des questions nouvelles de recherche, où nos vieilles mesures et notre 
manque de connaissance actuel n’ont pas leur place. Pour cela, nous avons 
besoin plus que jamais de vos recherches et de notre dialogue. 
Premièrement, la mesure des principaux déterminants structurels reste 
entourée d’incertitude. J’ai évoqué l’incertitude qui entourait la tendance de R*. 
Mais une incertitude semblable entoure la mesure de la production potentielle 
et du niveau de chômage naturel U* iv . Nous devons également travailler 
activement sur les effets économiques du changement climatique en le 
considérant comme un choc à long terme, mais significatif, et sur son 
interaction avec la politique monétaire. 
La meilleure mesure possible des anticipations d’inflation constitue le 
deuxième point fondamental. Nous savons que les anticipations sont les 
déterminants clés de l’inflation, mais nous ne savons pas clairement quelles 
Page 5 sur 13 
 
sont les mesures les plus pertinentes des anticipations d’inflation. Les 
anticipations des prévisionnistes professionnels (survey of professional 
forecasters) (à 1,7 %) et les mesures de marché (market-based measures) (à 
1,3 %) ont fait l’objet de la plus grande attention jusqu’à présent, mais les 
anticipations des entreprises comme celles des ménages – qui peuvent être 
nettement plus élevées – ont au moins autant d’importance pour la demande 
agrégée et la détermination des prix. Comme l’a souligné à juste titre Benoît 
Cœuré en juillet dernier, il faut faire davantage de recherches sur le contenu 
de leurs anticipations et sur la manière dont ils les forment v.  
Troisièmement, nous avons encore beaucoup à apprendre sur la manière dont 
les entreprises et les ménages forment leurs anticipations relatives aux taux 
d’intérêt futurs, ainsi que sur la manière dont ces anticipations affectent leurs 
décisions de dépenses. Nous savons que les modèles DSGE classiques 
tendent à attribuer une trop grande capacité de prévision aux agents privés.  
Une question centrale est de savoir comment intégrer un comportement 
réaliste, en particulier lorsqu’il s’agit de prévoir les effets de nos nouveaux 
instruments tels que la forward guidance vi . Il est certain qu’il demeurera 
toujours une incertitude quant à la réaction de notre économie aux politiques 
que nous menons, en particulier lorsque les entreprises et les ménages sont 
eux-mêmes encore en train d’apprendre comment nos mesures affectent 
l’économie et comment vivre avec des taux d’intérêt très bas, voire négatifs vii. 
Un dernier sujet mérite, à mes yeux, une attention particulière: les possibles 
effets secondaires de nos instruments monétaires sur la stabilité financière, en 
particulier les effets des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles. 
 
2. Politique monétaire et stabilité financière 
 
2.1 Les politiques prudentielles et la politique monétaire se complètent 
et ne se substituent pas l’une à l’autre 
Page 6 sur 13 
 
Pour répondre aux préoccupations relatives à la stabilité financière, la 
réglementation et la supervision, tant microprudentielle que macroprudentielle 
sont bien sûr à notre disposition et jouent un rôle essentiel. S’agissant de la 
réglementation financière, dix ans après la crise financière, nous devons 
résister à la tentation de défaire ce qui a été fait et à un excès de confiance 
nous faisant croire que « cette fois c’est différent ». 
La politique macroprudentielle est essentielle pour favoriser la stabilité 
financière. Toutefois, les politiques macroprudentielles ont leurs limites. 
Tout d’abord, notre palette d’instruments est actuellement très centrée sur les 
banques. Nous avons réalisé certains progrès vers une extension de la 
politique macroprudentielle au-delà du secteur bancaire. Mais nous devons 
reconnaître qu’il nous reste du chemin à faire et que cela devient une question 
urgente, dans la mesure où le secteur non bancaire évolue en réaction à 
l’environnement macrofinancier et aux modifications du cadre de 
réglementation. 
De plus, notre arsenal macroprudentiel étant encore relativement nouveau et 
non testé, une incertitude demeure quant à l’ampleur quantitative des effets de 
nos interventions. viii . L’expérience nous enseignera comment adapter et 
ajuster nos politiques au fil du temps, mais l’incertitude demeurera une 
caractéristique de l’élaboration de politiques en conditions réelles. 
Enfin, nous devons nous abstenir de toute arrogance : au fil du temps, nous 
élaborerons une palette plus complète d’instruments macroprudentiels et nous 
apprendrons à en faire le meilleur usage. Mais même si les politiques 
macroprudentielles peuvent certainement apporter une contribution 
importante, certaines causes profondes des crises financières demeureront 
hors de leur portée et ces politiques seules seraient insuffisantes pour assurer 
la stabilité financière. 
Si les politiques prudentielles ont des limites, il est légitime de se demander si 
la politique monétaire devrait prendre en compte les préoccupations relatives 
à la stabilité financière ou même apporter une aide aux politiques 
Page 7 sur 13 
 
prudentielles. Il est certain que la politique monétaire présente des 
inconvénients en tant qu’instrument pour favoriser la stabilité financière. En 
particulier, elle ne peut pas cibler des risques spécifiques. Mais comme l’a 
indiqué Jeremy Stein, le manque de précision de l’instrument fait aussi sa 
force : il affecte tous les acteurs financiers ix. 
Permettez-moi de prendre un peu de recul. Les banques centrales bénéficient 
d’une indépendance opérationnelle mais elles ne décident pas de leur propre 
mandat. Le mandat donné à l’Eurosystème est clair : notre objectif principal 
est la stabilité des prix. Toutefois, notre mandat stipule que nous « devons 
contribuer à la bonne conduite des politiques menées par les autorités 
compétentes en ce qui concerne la surveillance prudentielle des 
établissements de crédit et la stabilité du système financier » x. 
Le fait d’accorder une attention particulière à la dynamique de l’endettement 
des ménages, des entreprises et des intermédiaires financiers serait 
également conforme à la tradition intellectuelle de l’Eurosystème. Depuis sa 
création, la BCE a toujours accordé une attention particulière à des agrégats 
financiers larges lors de la définition de l’orientation de la politique monétaire. 
Cela a été souligné par son pilier monétaire et, à présent, par son analyse 
monétaire. Limiter l’attention aux mesures des engagements liquides tels que 
M3 est probablement peu justifié aujourd’hui compte tenu de la faible 
pertinence directe des agrégats monétaires pour les évolutions des prix. Mais 
la pertinence des agrégats de crédit plus larges et plus variés est 
incontestable tant pour les préoccupations relatives aux prix que pour celles 
liées à la stabilité financière. Associés aux prix des actifs, ces agrégats 
pourraient constituer le fondement d’un pilier financier et du crédit révisé xi. 
 
2.2 Le principe de séparation devient moins pertinent dans le cadre 
d’une politique monétaire à multiples facettes 
Le lien entre politique monétaire et stabilité financière soulève deux questions. 
Premièrement, quels sont les effets quantitatifs des instruments de politique 
Page 8 sur 13 
 
monétaire sur la stabilité financière ? Nous disposons à présent de 
suffisamment d’éléments montrant que les politiques de taux d’intérêt peuvent 
avoir des effets sur l’endettement, la prise de risque (par le biais de la 
transformation des échéances, de la recherche de rendement ou d’autres 
canaux) et la rentabilité des acteurs financiers. Ce serait par conséquent 
manquer de discernement que d’ignorer les effets secondaires exercés par la 
politique monétaire sur la stabilité financière. Deuxièmement, ces effets 
sont-ils suffisamment importants pour permettre de préserver la stabilité 
financière sans compromettre la stabilité des prix ? À ce stade, les termes 
précis d’un éventuel arbitrage sont toujours en discussion xii. Les questions 
sont complexes : comme l’a souligné Nuno Coimbra ici même à la PSE dans 
une étude réalisée avec Hélène Rey, une baisse des taux d’intérêt peut 
encourager la prise de risque lorsque les taux d’intérêt sont bas, mais la 
décourager lorsque ceux-ci sont élevés xiii. D’autres études sont nécessaires 
sur cette question importante. 
Permettez-moi de vous livrer deux réflexions sur cette question ouverte.  
a) Intégrer les préoccupations relatives à la stabilité financière dans une 
palette d’instruments étendue 
Premièrement, l’opposition binaire entre le principe de séparation classique et 
le fait « d’aller à contre-courant » a moins de sens lorsque la politique 
monétaire a elle-même plusieurs instruments à sa disposition. Une voie 
médiane, que nous pourrions qualifier de « coordonnée » ou « intégrée » est 
possible. En effet, le fait que ces différents instruments puissent permettre de 
poursuivre plusieurs objectifs est exactement ce qu’affirme la vieille règle de 
Tinbergen. 
Cela est particulièrement pertinent au sein de la politique monétaire dans 
notre contexte actuel. Au cours des dernières années, nous avons apporté 
des innovations à notre cadre opérationnel et nous avons considérablement 
étendu notre palette d’instruments avec des politiques de bilan telles que 
l’assouplissement quantitatif et les (T)LTRO. Comme notre politique de taux 
Page 9 sur 13 
 
d’intérêt peaufinée au fil du temps, ces politiques de bilan ont été introduites 
en ayant à l’esprit des objectifs de stabilité des prix. Mais à présent que notre 
palette d’instruments étendue nous a offert de nouvelles marges de liberté, il 
est utile de réfléchir à la façon dont cette nouvelle flexibilité pourrait être 
utilisée à long terme pour réduire au minimum les risques pesant sur la 
stabilité financière sans compromettre la stabilité des prix. 
Permettez-moi d’illustrer ce point avec l’exemple du mécanisme d’atténuation 
(tiering system). Le mécanisme d’atténuation que nous avons adopté 
permettra à notre politique de taux d’intérêt de maintenir la stabilité des prix 
sans la troquer contre la stabilité financière. Loin d’entrer en conflit avec la 
stabilité des prix, le mécanisme d’atténuation garantira en fait également que 
nos politiques exercent l’effet voulu sur la stabilité des prix, en atténuant le 
risque d’une transmission réduite de nos politiques au coût de financement du 
secteur privé. Et il peut accentuer l’orientation de la politique monétaire en 
atténuant les effets secondaires liés au maintien des taux d’intérêt à un niveau 
plus bas durant plus longtemps. 
Il n’y a aucune raison de dédier un instrument monétaire spécifique à l’objectif 
de stabilité financière. En revanche, un parallèle avec les finances publiques 
peut s’avérer utile. Les finances publiques considèrent généralement le 
problème du choix du taux d’imposition comme un élément permettant de 
minimiser les distorsions créées par les différents instruments fiscaux, afin 
d’obtenir un niveau de recettes donné. De même, il est possible de considérer 
que nos décisions de politique monétaire consistent à choisir la combinaison 
d’instruments qui minimisent les risques pesant sur la stabilité financière, afin 
d’apporter l’orientation nécessaire pour respecter notre mandat de maintien de 
la stabilité des prix. 
De la même façon, certains de nos nouveaux instruments pourraient être plus 
efficaces pour répondre aux préoccupations liées à la stabilité financière. Par 
exemple, sous certains aspects, les politiques de bilan diffèrent sensiblement 
des politiques de taux d’intérêt. En fournissant aux banques de précieux actifs 
Page 10 sur 13 
 
sûrs – les réserves de banque centrale – un niveau élevé de réserves de 
banque centrale peut favoriser leur bon fonctionnement. Encore plus 
important, il peut atténuer le risque que les banques tentent de répondre à la 
demande d’actifs sûrs en les concevant elles-mêmes. Les actifs sûrs émis par 
le secteur privé sont de piètres substituts aux actifs sûrs publics xiv. 
 
b) Maintenir les achats d’actifs du secteur privé à un niveau minimum 
Dans tous les cas – et ce sera ma seconde remarque – les achats d’actifs du 
secteur privé par la banque centrale doivent être maintenus à un niveau 
minimum. En effet, l’actif du bilan – les actifs que la banque centrale achète 
avec les réserves qu’elle émet – a beaucoup d’importance. Acheter un 
montant excessif d’actifs du secteur privé, tels que des obligations 
d’entreprise, pourrait faire courir le risque d’une distorsion du signal donné par 
les prix des actifs s’agissant du risque lié aux actifs. La réduction actuelle des 
primes de risque et des écarts de rendement pourrait déjà accroître les 
risques pesant sur la stabilité financière. 
** 
Conclusion 
J’ai limité mes remarques sur la stabilité financière aux politiques qui, au 
moins en partie, entrent dans le domaine de compétence d’une banque 
centrale. Toutefois, comme je l’ai souligné précédemment, les politiques 
monétaire et prudentielle ne sont pas les seules politiques disponibles. 
Compte tenu de l’environnement économique actuel, les politiques 
budgétaires et les réformes structurelles peuvent, et doivent, faire de plus en 
plus partie du « policy mix ». Mais cela découle également du principe 
directeur que j’ai mis en évidence aujourd’hui : plus il y a d’outils disponibles, 
plus il est facile de les combiner pour minimiser les arbitrages entre stabilité 
des prix et stabilité financière. 
Page 11 sur 13 
 
La politique budgétaire peut venir en aide à la politique monétaire de plusieurs 
manières pour favoriser la stabilité financière. Premièrement, elle peut bien sûr 
apporter une aide en allégeant le fardeau pesant sur la politique monétaire. 
Mais la politique budgétaire peut aussi aider directement la politique monétaire 
pour favoriser la stabilité financière. Elle peut aider la politique monétaire à 
fournir les actifs sûrs nécessaires à un système financier résistant, y compris 
si possible sous la forme d’un actif sûr à l’échelle de la zone euro. Du côté de 
la fiscalité, elle doit réduire toutes les incitations excessives en faveur de 
l’investissement dans l’immobilier et favoriser une répartition plus neutre de 
l’épargne en respectant une rétribution saine du risque. 
Laissez-moi terminer par une question : que sera la politique monétaire dans 
dix ans ? Nous ne pouvons à l’évidence avoir de certitudes, mais nous 
pouvons partager une conviction : le plus nous aurons avancé ensemble sur 
tous ces sujets, meilleure sera la politique monétaire. Merci de votre attention, 
et de votre coopération.

","","Les défis actuels pour la politique monétaire"
"discours_2019_09_24_1.json","24.09.2019"," 
 
La Fed et la BCE viennent d’abaisser leurs taux. Les économies 
américaines et européennes avaient-elles besoin d’un nouveau coup de 
fouet ?  
Nous observons des deux côtés de l’Atlantique, un ralentissement de la 
croissance – et de ce fait une inflation moins importante que prévue. La raison 
première en est la même : les tensions liées au protectionnisme qui se 
répercutent sur le commerce mondial. Cette incertitude publique crée un 
manque de confiance privée avec pour conséquence, chez les entrepreneurs, 
de moindres investissements. 
La politique monétaire devait réagir en accroissant son soutien, et c’est ce 
que la Banque centrale européenne a fait clairement.  Dans le même temps, 
nous disons cependant que la politique monétaire ne peut être l’unique 
instrument de croissance économique. Selon les cas, il faut utiliser la politique 
budgétaire dans les pays qui ont suffisamment de marges de manœuvre ou la 
politique salariale dans ceux qui connaissent le plein emploi. D’autres pays 
enfin, doivent amplifier les réformes structurelles. En résumé, la politique 
monétaire fait tout son devoir mais elle ne peut pas tout faire à elle seule.  
  
Comment rétablir la confiance ? 
La réponse la plus efficace serait celle apportée par ceux-là-même qui ont 
créé cette incertitude, c’est-à-dire les dirigeants politiques et notamment 
l’administration américaine. Il est certain qu’une clarification du contexte 
commercial dans lequel agissent les chefs d’entreprise aux États-Unis, en 
Allemagne, en Asie et ailleurs, serait un élément décisif pour la confiance, et 
donc favorable à la reprise mondiale. Et l'Europe doit être unie pour pouvoir 
peser entre l'Amérique et la Chine.  
  
La baisse des taux doit relancer les économies face à des risques de 
récession. La Banque de France et l’OCDE ont abaissé leurs prévisions de 
croissance pour 2020. Les banques centrales ont elles raté leurs 
objectifs ?  
Regardons précisément où en est l’économie française. La Banque de 
France, dans sa prévision totalement indépendante, vient de confirmer une 
hausse du PIB de 1,3 % pour 2019. La croissance française résiste donc plutôt 
 
 
bien : elle est plus de deux fois supérieure à l’Allemagne ; elle dépasse aussi 
celle de la moyenne des pays de la zone euro, ce qu'on n'avait pas vu depuis 
plusieurs années. Ceci tient notamment à deux éléments positifs. D’abord, une 
hausse de 2,3 % du pouvoir d’achat par habitant : par rapport à cette moyenne, 
chaque Français reste naturellement d'abord sensible à l'évolution de sa propre 
situation, mais c’est la plus forte progression d'ensemble observée depuis 
douze ans. Elle soutient la consommation et la croissance. Autre bonne 
surprise, le nombre de créations d’emplois : nous en attendons 270.000 cette 
année ; entre 2016 et 2019, la France aura créé 1 million d’emplois 
supplémentaires. Cette performance, qui n’a pas beaucoup de précédents, a 
été bien aidée par la politique monétaire accommodante. Mais la meilleure 
performance française est aussi la preuve que d’autres éléments de politiques 
économiques sont nécessaires. Avec en particulier, la mise en œuvre de 
réformes structurelles efficaces, pour simplifier le droit du travail et baisser les 
coûts du travail : c’est ce dont la France commence à bénéficier aujourd’hui sur 
le marché de l’emploi.  
  
L’économie française semble bien résister mais ne craignez-vous pas que 
les ménages épargnent face aux incertitudes ?  
Quand les revenus et donc le pouvoir d’achat ont crû, y compris au travers 
des mesures de fin 2018 comme celles augmentant la prime d’activité, nous 
nous attendions bien à ce qu’une part significative des salaires soit épargnée, 
comme cela a été observé historiquement. Le taux d’épargne est monté 
effectivement à un peu plus de 15 % des revenus. Nous pensons aujourd’hui 
voir une stabilisation de ce taux favorisant une accélération de la 
consommation, d'autant plus que le moral de ménages s'améliore mois après 
mois. En hausse de 1,3 % en moyenne cette année, la consommation devrait 
accélérer à 1,7 % en 2020.  
  
Les prévisions de la Banque de France ne doivent-elles pas être 
relativisées compte tenu du bond récent du prix du baril de pétrole ?  
Depuis mai, le prix du baril avait significativement baissé, passant de plus 
de 70 dollars à moins de 60 dollars avant l’attaque sur l’Arabie Saoudite. Cette 
baisse contribue à soutenir la croissance française. Aujourd’hui, le prix du baril 
est remonté un peu au-dessus de 60 dollars mais il demeure nettement inférieur 
 
 
à son niveau d’avant l’été. Nous restons attentifs aux développements sur les 
marchés pétroliers mais il est encore trop tôt pour savoir si les effets de l'attaque 
seront durables ou temporaires. 
  
Face à la baisse des taux, de plus en plus de Français empruntent. 
Craignez-vous une hausse des défauts de paiements ? 
Le niveau actuel des taux bas est sans conteste favorable à l’économie et 
la croissance. Un patron de PME qui veut investir trouve aujourd’hui des 
conditions de financement extrêmement favorables ; de même, un ménage qui 
souhaite faire un emprunt immobilier, par exemple de 200.000 euros sur 15 
ans paiera au total son crédit 30.000 euros de moins qu’il y a 5 ans, avant ces 
décisions monétaires accommodantes.  
Pour autant, nous devons continuer à être vigilant sur la solidité des 
banques et des assurances, et sur l’ensemble du cycle financier, c’est-à-dire 
l’évolution du prix des actifs immobiliers et financiers. C’est ce que nous faisons 
au sein d’une instance créée en 2013, le Haut conseil de stabilité financière 
(HCSF). Il est présidé par le ministre des finances Bruno Le Maire ; j’en suis le 
rapporteur et il est aussi composé de plusieurs personnalités indépendantes. 
Ce haut conseil se réunit au moins une fois par trimestre pour analyser les 
risques et décider d’un certain nombre de mesures. Ces dernières années, le 
HCSF a notamment décidé d’augmenter le capital de sécurité des banques, le 
coussin contra cyclique. Il surveille constamment l’apparition éventuelle de 
risques spécifiques, notamment dans le secteur immobilier.  
  
Les épargnants français peuvent-ils ou doivent-ils craindre de voir leurs 
dépôts ponctionnés par les taux négatifs ?  
Certains établissements de gestion de fortune en Europe ont décidé ou 
envisagent d’appliquer des taux négatifs aux seuls gros patrimoines ; 
généralement ce sont des comptes qui ne sont pas sous mandat de gestion et 
dont le solde dépasse par exemple 1 million d’euros. Mais aujourd’hui, aucune 
banque française n’applique des taux négatifs à ses clients particuliers habituels 
ou à ses clients PME, et je veux ici le dire clairement : nous comptons bien que 
cette situation demeure durablement. Et ce d’autant plus qu’il y a trois semaines, 
nous avons pris au niveau de la BCE une décision technique d’atténuation du 
coût des taux négatifs pour les banques (le tiering).    
 
 
  
Et qu’en est-il pour les grandes entreprises ?  
Il s’agit d’une situation économique différente. Les taux de rendement 
négatifs sont appliqués entre institutions financières ou vis-à-vis des grandes 
entreprises, mais il faut rappeler que beaucoup d’entre elles peuvent aussi 
emprunter elles-mêmes à des taux négatifs.  
  
Êtes-vous davantage inquiet des conséquences du Brexit sur l’économie 
française ou du ralentissement de l’Allemagne ?  
Nous respectons le choix du peuple britannique, mais le Brexit reste une 
mauvaise nouvelle pour l’économie britannique et dans une moindre mesure 
pour l’économie européenne. Si nous devions connaître un scenario no deal, la 
Grande-Bretagne perdrait d'un coup 450 millions de clients et l’Europe 
seulement 60 millions. Donc si un accord est encore possible, il est évidemment 
très souhaitable sur le plan économique. 
L’Allemagne est un partenaire plus important de l’économie française. Le 
ralentissement allemand joue donc aujourd’hui défavorablement. Cela dit, le 
modèle allemand de compétitivité industrielle, de formation professionnelle, de 
négociations sociales reste très efficace. Par ailleurs, l'Allemagne a largement 
la solution à son propre problème, grâce à des marges de manœuvres 
budgétaires significatives ; elle a des besoins importants d’investissements 
publics, y compris sur la transition énergétique. Nous ne pouvons pas encore 
préjuger des discussions politiques internes à l’Allemagne, mais le débat y est 
en train de s'y déployer.  
  
Pétrole haut, Brexit, ralentissement en Allemagne et au Royaume-Uni et 
probables économies sur le budget, quels seront les conséquences sur 
les déficits ?  
Je veux d'abord rappeler que la Banque de France n’est pas en charge du 
déficit ou de la politique budgétaire. Notre mission, en toute indépendance, est 
de garantir aux Français la valeur de leur monnaie, l’euro, et l'accès à des 
services financiers et des financements sûrs. Le budget est de la responsabilité 
du gouvernement et du parlement. J’observe que la prévision officielle de 
 
 
croissance soutenant le budget 2020, à 1,3 % l’an prochain, est identique à celle 
que nous avons faite avec sérieux. Cette prévision de croissance détermine 
elle-même le niveau des recettes fiscales qui est souvent l’aléa principal sur le 
déficit.  
  
On vient de fêter les 20 ans de l’euro. Les Français en ont-ils vraiment 
bénéficié ?  
La Banque de France y a consacré en avril dernier sa traditionnelle ""Lettre 
au président de la République"" en dressant publiquement un bilan de l’euro pour 
les Français. Il faut d'abord souligner qu’ils sont dans leur grande majorité 
attachés à la monnaie européenne : 70 % d’entre eux veulent garder l’euro 
comme monnaie.  
L’euro a apporté aux Français la stabilité des prix et une inflation faible. Au cours 
des vingt dernières années, l’inflation a été en moyenne de 1,4 % par an. Au 
cours des 20 années qui avaient précédé l’introduction de l’euro, elle était au 
contraire de 5,1% ; c’était plus du triple. Pour répondre à un débat qu'il y a 
parfois sur ces chiffres, nous avons d’ailleurs, dans cette même Lettre, comparé 
l’évolution de certains biens courants - à commencer par la baguette de pain - 
et avons constaté une hausse des prix similaire. L’euro n’est pas la seule cause 
de cette diminution de l’inflation mais il y a sérieusement contribué. 
  
L’inflation est certes maîtrisée mais les Français sont surtout sensibles à 
l’évolution de leur pouvoir d’achat… 
La conséquence de cette maîtrise de l’inflation, c’est l’augmentation du 
pouvoir d’achat des Français. Entre 1999 (date d’introduction de l’euro) et 2018, 
le pouvoir d’achat réel, après inflation, a augmenté au total de 20% par habitant 
en moyenne, soit 1% par an. Certes, il y a eu des années plus difficiles et des 
périodes plus favorables comme celle que nous connaissons actuellement ; et 
cette moyenne recouvre des évolutions différenciées selon les catégories de 
ménages. Cette augmentation du pouvoir d’achat a été nettement plus forte en 
France que dans la moyenne de la zone euro, où elle a été de 12%. Oui, l’euro 
a tenu sa promesse de protéger la valeur de la monnaie des Français, grâce à 
une inflation bien maîtrisée ; de plus, il a ainsi bien défendu leur pouvoir d’achat 
réel. Propos recueillis par Marie de Greef-Madelin et Frédéric Paya

Inflation : comment mieux tenir compte des anticipations des ménages ? 
Bundesbank, Francfort     
26 septembre 2019 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
en présence de Jens Weidmann 
 
  
2 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’ouvrir - avec mon collègue Jens Weidmann - cette 
conférence commune de la Bundesbank et de la Banque de France consacrée au 
thème des anticipations des ménages. Je tiens à remercier chaleureusement la 
Bundesbank : cette coopération franco-allemande témoigne que nos deux institutions 
peuvent promouvoir et contribuer à des travaux de recherche de qualité sur un sujet 
de politique monétaire qui se situe au cœur de l’actualité. L’année dernière, un recul 
important des anticipations de marché en matière d’inflation a été observé, alors que 
les anticipations des ménages se sont inscrites en hausse régulière. Cette 
divergence est un défi pour notre évaluation des anticipations d’inflation. Toutes les 
contributions intéressantes qui vous seront présentées au cours des deux prochains 
jours illustreront combien l’observation des anticipations d’inflation en dehors des 
marchés financiers peut être riche d’enseignements.  
I. Les anticipations d’inflation : une question fondamentale pour la 
politique monétaire 
I.1. Pertinence pour les banques centrales en matière de politique monétaire 
Des anticipations d’inflation stables à un niveau proche de notre objectif sont - bien 
entendu - fondamentales pour notre politique monétaire : elles fournissent un 
ancrage nominal solide qui nous aide à stabiliser l’inflation en cas d’importants chocs 
de demande ou d’offre. Depuis les années 1990, la gestion des anticipations 
d’inflation par le biais de la communication des banques centrales est devenue un 
outil conventionnel de politique monétaire. De nombreux éléments suggèrent que 
cette politique a contribué à ancrer les anticipations d’inflation et à réduire leur 
volatilité, face à d’importants chocs inflationnistes ou déflationnistes. La Grande Crise 
3 
 
Financière constitue un bon exemple : à l’époque, les anticipations d’inflation 
robustes et solidement ancrées dans la zone euro ont contribué à neutraliser les 
puissantes forces déflationnistes qui affectaient nos économies.  
Toutefois, depuis lors, les mesures des anticipations d’inflation extraites des 
instruments de marché dans la zone euro se sont inscrites en baisse, une baisse 
encore plus prononcée depuis début 2019. Ce recul des anticipations de marché a 
soulevé, parmi les analystes qui suivent les banques centrales, des interrogations sur 
les risques potentiels de désancrage des anticipations d’inflation et, plus 
généralement, sur notre capacité à remplir notre mandat de stabilité des prix.  
I.2. La nécessité d’une meilleure information en matière d’anticipations des 
ménages 
Je voudrais souligner que les anticipations d’inflation extraites des instruments de 
marché ne sont pas les seules mesures disponibles pour évaluer les risques futurs 
en matière d’inflation. Les prévisionnistes professionnels et les projections du 
consensus économique fournissent un chiffre nettement plus élevé que le taux de 
swaps indexé sur l’inflation 5a5a, à environ 1,7 %, plutôt que de 1,2 à 1,3 %, bien 
que tous ces indicateurs d’anticipations d’inflation se soient orientés à la baisse au fil 
du temps (Graphique 1). Les mesures des anticipations d’inflation extraites des 
instruments de marché présentent également des limites techniques : premièrement, 
en raison de la liquidité des marchés financiers et, deuxièmement, car elles sont 
affectées par l’évolution de la prime de risque au fil du temps. De plus, si les 
anticipations des marchés financiers fournissent des informations sur les conditions 
de financement futures, l’évolution des prix et des salaires dépend plus largement et 
directement de ce que prévoient les ménages et les entreprises en matière de 
4 
 
croissance et d’inflation futures. Par conséquent, les enquêtes réalisées auprès des 
entreprises et des ménages peuvent fournir des informations extrêmement utiles et 
précieuses sur les anticipations.  
Mieux suivre les anticipations d’inflation du grand public n’est pas chose aisée, dans 
la mesure où les anticipations d’inflation des entreprises ou des consommateurs ne 
sont pas directement observables. Pour le moment, des données fiables sur les 
anticipations d’inflation des consommateurs ou des entreprises sont rares dans la 
zone euro, tandis que dans d’autres juridictions, de nombreuses enquêtes relatives 
aux anticipations ont été développées – parmi les exemples connus et récents, on 
peut citer la New York Fed Survey, la Tankan survey au Japon ou les différentes 
enquêtes de la Banque d’Angleterre. À cet égard, la nouvelle enquête de la 
Bundesbank relative aux ménages contribue à combler cette lacune et constitue 
également un excellent exemple des efforts récemment mis en œuvre par les 
banques centrales pour collecter de nouvelles informations de meilleure qualité 
concernant les anticipations des agents économiques. 
II. La communication des banques centrales doit également cibler les 
ménages 
Pour le moment, les informations les plus fiables dont nous disposons en matière 
d’anticipations d’inflation du grand public dans la zone euro proviennent de l’enquête 
menée auprès des consommateurs par la Commission Européenne. Si l’on compare 
les différentes sources d’anticipations d’inflation avec les anticipations tirées de 
l’enquête menée auprès des consommateurs, nous observons qu’elles délivrent un 
message très différent de celui des marchés financiers sur le niveau des 
5 
 
anticipations d’inflation. Les ménages européens perçoivent un taux d’inflation 
proche de 10 %, tandis que leurs anticipations d’inflation sont plus proches de 5 %. 
Un tel résultat implique que nous devons nettement améliorer notre communication 
destinée à un public plus large. Nous pouvons également en conclure que, si les 
ménages ne sont pas pleinement conscients du niveau de l’inflation, ils perçoivent 
cependant assez correctement l’évolution globale de l’inflation au fil du temps 
(Graphique 2). Comme l’a déjà souligné Benoît Coeuré 1, si les ménages ne sont pas 
des prévisionnistes professionnels, leurs anticipations d’inflation et les projections 
des prévisionnistes professionnels sont toutefois généralement bien corrélées sur un 
même horizon de prévision (un an) (Graphique 3). Cependant, nous observons au 
cours de la période récente une divergence entre les anticipations des 
consommateurs et les indicateurs des marchés financiers. Dans la mesure où cela 
pourrait fortement affecter la trajectoire future de l’inflation, cette tendance récente 
soulève d’importantes questions : cette divergence persistera-t-elle ou est-elle 
temporaire ? Quelles sont les origines de la divergence entre les anticipations 
d’inflation des marchés financiers et celles des ménages ? 
III. Les anticipations d’inflation des entreprises présentent également un 
intérêt primordial pour les banques centrales. 
Même si cette conférence porte essentiellement sur les anticipations des ménages, 
j’aimerais souligner que suivre les anticipations d’inflation des entreprises présente 
également un intérêt primordial du point de vue de la politique monétaire.  
L’information sur les anticipations d’inflation des entreprises est encore plus rare que 
pour les ménages. Cette rareté de l’information tranche fortement avec sa pertinence

événement organisé par le SAFE Policy center le 11 juillet 2019

pour la conduite de la politique monétaire : in fine, les entreprises fixent les prix dans 
l’économie et prennent également part au processus de fixation des salaires. De 
plus, des résultats empiriques indiquent que leurs anticipations affectent leurs 
décisions économiques, telles que l’emploi ou l’investissement. Les données 
recueillies auprès des entreprises néo-zélandaises sont parmi les plus exhaustives et 
montrent que les anticipations d’inflation des chefs d’entreprise ne sont pas si 
différentes de celles des ménages. En Europe, la Banca d’Italia a également 
développé une enquête très riche et instructive concernant les anticipations des 
entreprises depuis 1999. La Bundesbank a elle aussi réalisé une enquête très 
intéressante, qui demandait aux syndicats et aux employeurs quel était le niveau 
d’inflation visé dans le dernier accord salarial collectif. Il serait très utile de disposer 
de données comparatives sur ces questions pour les différents pays de la zone euro. 
Je suis convaincu qu’analyser davantage les anticipations des entreprises produirait 
des informations très précieuses et pertinentes pour notre politique monétaire.  
Conclusion 
Permettez-moi de conclure en rappelant que nous devons mieux mesurer les 
anticipations d’inflation des consommateurs et des entreprises. Ce manque 
d’information empêche nos politiques de communication d’être pleinement efficaces. 
Le type d’outils pouvant être mobilisé pour améliorer la communication avec le grand 
public et influencer ses anticipations d’inflation constitue un sujet important pour la 
politique monétaire. 
Cette conférence constitue une occasion unique de bénéficier des analyses des 
experts les plus distingués sur toutes les questions passionnantes qui sont liées aux 
7 
 
anticipations des ménages. Je vous souhaite des discussions très fructueuses. Je 
vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames et Messieurs, chers étudiants,  
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui. Cher Thomas, les deux rives 
de l’Atlantique bénéficient de vos compétences en économie. L’enseignement 
de grande qualité que vous, étudiants, recevez ici, à la NYU Stern Business 
School, vous donnera les outils nécessaires pour comprendre et relever les 
défis d’ampleur mondiale. Aujourd’hui, dans mon discours introductif, je vais en 
évoquer un, le ralentissement actuel en Europe, et développer rapidement trois 
paradoxes : 1- les causes du ralentissement sont largement extérieures à la 
zone euro, mais ses effets sont très forts sur sa première économie ; 2- la 
polémique récente sur la politique monétaire a peu d’intérêt pour l’avenir ; 3- la 
zone euro a plus de marges de manœuvre non monétaires, mais les 
sous-utilise.  
** 
I. Les causes du ralentissement sont largement extérieures à la zone euro, 
mais ses effets sont très forts sur sa première économie  
Les causes du ralentissement sont largement extérieures à la zone euro : 
l’incertitude est incontestablement la première d’entre elles; elle est surtout 
d’origine humaine (« man-made »), c’est donc aux hommes d’y remédier. 
L’intensification des tensions commerciales a entraîné un ralentissement 
significatif du commerce mondial [slide] : dans son dernier numéro des 
Perspectives de l’économie mondiale, le FMI anticipe la croissance mondiale la 
plus faible depuis 2008-2009 [slide]. La perte de croissance mondiale due à la 
guerre commerciale pourrait atteindre jusqu’à 0,8 % l’an prochain, 
principalement en raison de ses effets indirects, au-delà des droits de douane : 
baisse de la confiance des chefs d’entreprise et de l’investissement, diminution 
de la productivité. De même, les rebondissements liés au Brexit ont généré de 
la volatilité dans la croissance trimestrielle du Royaume-Uni, et ont pesé sur 
l’investissement des entreprises.   
En dépit de ce contexte morose, l’économie française résiste bien, avec une 
croissance de 1,3 %, proche de son potentiel. Le pouvoir d’achat par habitant 
Page 2 sur 5 
 
devrait s’accélérer nettement en 2019 (2,3 %), soutenu par la vigueur des 
revenus du travail – 1 million d’emplois ont été créés au cours des quatre 
dernières années – et par la relance budgétaire. Mais, dans l’ensemble, la zone 
euro est durement touchée, principalement en raison du poids de l’Allemagne, 
dont la croissance s’établirait à 0,4 % seulement cette année. Bien évidemment, 
l’Allemagne est fortement spécialisée dans la fabrication de biens d’équipement 
et « surexposée » au commerce mondial – les exportations allemandes 
représentent environ 50 % de son PIB. Associés à un bouleversement radical 
de l’industrie automobile, ces phénomènes exercent sur l’économie allemande 
presque les effets d’un choc asymétrique.  
 
II. La polémique récente sur la politique monétaire a peu d’intérêt pour 
l’avenir 
Ces dernières années, la politique monétaire a joué pleinement son rôle en 
aidant l’Europe à faire face à la tempête. Je voudrais rendre hommage au 
capitaine de notre navire, Mario Draghi, dont le mandat va bientôt prendre fin. 
C’est grâce au leadership de Mario Draghi que nous avons protégé notre atout 
le plus précieux, l’euro, et préservé notre union monétaire. Grâce à sa 
détermination sans faille et à son engagement à faire « tout ce qui est 
nécessaire », nous sommes tous encore à bord.  
Grâce à lui, l’Eurosystème a déployé une stratégie de politique monétaire 
accommodante et innovante. Au cours des cinq dernières années, la BCE a 
expérimenté divers instruments non conventionnels de politique monétaire ; et 
elle a eu un recours certes plus tardif, mais plus approfondi que la Fed ou la 
Banque d’Angleterre, à cette boîte à outils. Et les différents instruments peuvent 
influer sur des parties différentes de la courbe des taux.  
Cette politique a permis de soutenir la reprise économique dans la zone euro 
depuis 2013. Certains résultats positifs des dernières années ayant visiblement 
échappé à un récent mémorandum de la « vieille garde », je voudrais rappeler 
Page 3 sur 5 
 
ceci : les estimations de l’efficacité des politiques monétaires non 
conventionnelles mises en œuvre depuis 2013 varient largement entre elles 
mais sont de l’ordre de 2,5 points de pourcentage pour la croissance et entre 1 
et 1,5 point de pourcentage pour l’inflation au cours de la période 2015-2018. 
Alors que nous vivons une hausse de l’incertitude, le récent renforcement de 
notre forward guidance – qui est désormais fortement dépendante de la 
situation (state-based) – démontre notre détermination à atteindre notre objectif 
d’inflation. Nous prévoyons à présent que les taux demeureront à leurs niveaux 
actuels de – 0,5 %, ou à des niveaux plus bas, jusqu’à ce que les perspectives 
d’inflation convergent durablement vers un niveau suffisamment proche de, 
mais inférieur à 2 %, et que cette convergence se reflète de manière cohérente 
dans la dynamique de l’inflation sous-jacente. En outre, ce renforcement de 
notre forward guidance implique la prolongation en conséquence de la période 
des réinvestissements du stock très important d’actifs du QE – 2 600 milliards 
d’euros. Le mécanisme d’atténuation (tiering system) nous permettra de limiter 
les éventuels effets secondaires que les taux négatifs pourraient avoir sur la 
rentabilité des banques, ce qui est primordial pour préserver la transmission de 
notre politique monétaire par le canal du crédit bancaire. 
La discussion au Conseil des gouverneurs de début septembre est maintenant 
derrière nous ; chacun s’y est exprimé légitimement – j’ai moi-même formulé 
mes propres réserves sur une partie du paquet de mesures – ; mais les 
décisions y ont été prises tout aussi légitimement, et elles clarifient les choses 
pour un bon moment. N’ayez aucun doute : nous sommes engagés, et 
l’ensemble du paquet sera mis en œuvre. Nous devons maintenant aller 
résolument de l’avant, avec trois éléments de consensus forts autour de Mario 
Draghi aujourd’hui et de Christine Lagarde demain : nous devons maintenir une 
politique monétaire accommodante face au ralentissement économique et à la 
faible inflation. Deuxièmement, un réexamen de notre cadre de politique 
monétaire sera tout à fait bienvenu. Et troisièmement, il est tout à fait 
souhaitable que la politique budgétaire prolonge maintenant ce soutien 
Page 4 sur 5 
 
monétaire, partout où cela est possible en Europe. Il est temps de tourner la 
page et de se tourner vers l’avenir.  
III. La zone euro a plus de marges de manœuvre non monétaires que 
d’autres, mais les sous-utilise  
La politique monétaire ne peut plus tout faire. Les banques centrales – y compris 
la BCE – ne peuvent pas faire de miracles. Ce paradoxe est douloureux ou 
prometteur…. ou les deux : la zone euro dispose de plus de marges de 
manœuvre que les États-Unis ou le Royaume-Uni, mais elle a jusqu’à présent 
été beaucoup moins disposée à les utiliser et ce, pour deux raisons [slide].  
1/ La zone euro a une dette publique plus faible (85 %) que les États-Unis 
(104 %) ou le Royaume-Uni (87 %) ; elle a les taux d’intérêt souverains les plus 
bas – ils sont souvent négatifs –, mais elle a beaucoup moins recours à la 
relance budgétaire. Elle devrait à présent exploiter ses marges de manœuvre 
budgétaires là où elles existent – notamment en Allemagne – pour favoriser la 
stabilisation cyclique et la croissance à long terme. Il est également possible 
d’augmenter les salaires dans les pays en situation de plein emploi et dont le 
solde extérieur est excédentaire. En outre, il est essentiel de choisir des 
dépenses de qualité, à commencer par l’investissement. À cet égard, je salue 
la création annoncée d’un fonds d’investissement néerlandais ayant pour cibles 
des projets dans les infrastructures, le numérique ou le changement climatique. 
Il pourrait représenter jusqu’à 7 % du PIB : il y a là matière à réflexion si l’on 
transpose cet ordre de grandeur à l’échelle européenne. La dette privée – qui 
représente 119 % du PIB environ – est également beaucoup plus faible dans la 
zone euro qu’aux États-Unis (148 %), au Royaume-Uni (152 %) ou au Japon 
(152 %). Mais bien sûr, l’environnement de taux plus bas sur une période plus 
longue (« lower for longer ») nécessite une vigilance accrue en matière de 
stabilité financière. Le FMI vient de le souligner dans son « radar » le plus 
récent, le dernier rapport sur la stabilité financière dans le monde [slide]. De part 
et d’autre de l’Atlantique, nous devons accorder une plus grande attention aux 
non-banques et à la dette avec effet de levier, et ne pas hésiter à activer les 
Page 5 sur 5 
 
instruments macroprudentiels, et dépasser le vieux « principe de séparation » 
entre politique monétaire et stabilité financière : je préconise une coordination 
plus intelligente1. 
2/ En outre, la zone euro dispose d’une ressource abondante : un excédent 
d’épargne de plus de 300 milliards d’euros pour financer l’investissement. 
L’agenda de la croissance en Europe doit donner la priorité absolue à une 
Union pour l’épargne et l’investissement durable, afin d’atteindre deux 
objectifs majeurs, comme proposé dans le rapport « Next CMU », publié la 
semaine dernière par le Conseil Ecofin : (a) offrir des produits d’épargne qui 
répondent aux besoins des citoyens et allouer du capital à des investissements 
créateurs de valeur dans l’économie réelle, innovante et durable ; 
(b) construire/renforcer un marché européen des capitaux intégré, compétitif, 
profond et liquide pour permettre à l’UE de demeurer l’une des deux premières 
places financières du monde [slide]. Pour cela, il est grand temps de faire 
avancer résolument l’Union bancaire et l’Union des marchés capitaux : passons 
enfin des mots aux actes !   
** 
En conclusion, je voudrais citer l’un des membres fondateurs des États-Unis, 
Benjamin Franklin : “we must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we 
shall all hang separately.” (« il nous faut être solidaires, coude à coude, sans

l’objectif que nous devons viser à l’intérieur de l’Europe – construire une Union 
plus intégrée – et à l’extérieur – œuvrer à un multilatéralisme renouvelé.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je tiens à remercier Madame la députée de la Raudière pour son invitation à cette 
conférence qui témoigne de l’intérêt toujours plus vif suscité par l’évolution en cours du 
système bancaire et financier. Les organisateurs de cette conférence m’ont demandé 
d’apporter en quelques minutes mon éclairage de banquier central et de superviseur sur 
les questions complexes que pose l’essor de la numérisation dans le secteur financier.  
Je vais m’efforcer de relever ce défi, en commençant par observer que, depuis 
quelques années déjà, l’Europe est entrée dans un monde où le numérique 
modifie en profondeur les modèles d’affaires de nombreux secteurs 
économiques. Le secteur bancaire et financier n’échappe pas à ce mouvement. De 
nouveaux acteurs entrent sur le marché avec des propositions nouvelles, plus adaptées 
aux usages et aux exigences du consommateur « numérique ». Ils bousculent les 
acteurs établis en fragmentant une chaîne de valeur traditionnellement très intégrée. Les 
premiers de ces nouveaux entrants sont les Fintech, start-ups capables de surperformer 
les acteurs historiques sur un maillon de la chaîne de valeur, en apportant de nouveaux 
services aux consommateurs ou en réduisant les coûts. Les seconds sont les Bigtech. 
Ils s’appuient sur de formidables quantités de données et l’expérience de leur 
exploitation; en jouant sur les effets de réseau, ils commencent à attaquer des maillons 
stratégiques de cette chaîne de valeur (les services à forte valeur ajoutée technologique 
et parfois la relation clients) afin de pouvoir proposer de nouvelles activités génératrices 
de profit. Tant par leur domination sur certains secteurs - prenons l’exemple du cloud 
computing – que par leur capacité d’expansion – leurs réserves de trésorerie leur 
permettent de pénétrer un marché, de le dominer et d’utiliser la technologie pour créer 
des barrières à l’entrée - ces nouveaux entrants induisent un risque significatif de 
dépendance, voire de captivité, pour les acteurs financiers établis. Si aujourd’hui les 
Bigtech sont, en Europe du moins, des sous-traitants des banques et des 
assurances, on ne peut exclure un renversement des modèles d’affaires qui 
cantonnerait les établissements financiers au rôle de fournisseurs de services 
spécialisés : origination de crédit, middle et back-office, conformité. 
Ces perspectives soulèvent plusieurs questions en termes de souveraineté 
européenne : comment peut-on efficacement protéger les données des citoyens 
(qu’elles soient de paiement ou personnelles) et leur offrir un véritable contrôle sur leur 
 
2 
 
utilisation ? Comment, dans un écosystème global aux architectures toujours plus 
ouvertes, renforcer la solidité et la résilience du système financier face aux risques 
cyber ? Comment favoriser le développement de solutions de paiement pan 
européennes face à la concurrence croissante exercée par des acteurs extra-européens 
sur le segment des solutions de paiement ? En matière de lutte contre le blanchiment et 
le financement du terrorisme (LCB-FT), comment répondre efficacement au défi des 
crypto-actifs, dont plusieurs ont été conçus sur le principe de l’anonymat et l’évitement 
des règles de l’État de droit? Enfin, question posée plus directement au Banquier central 
et au superviseur que je suis : comment envisager l’exercice de nos missions de 
régulation dans un secteur financier aux contours et au fonctionnement en cours de 
mutation ? 
* 
Des réponses appropriées à ces questions doivent de mon point de vue reposer 
sur trois piliers : (i) un diagnostic lucide, (ii) l’ouverture d’esprit nécessaire pour 
proposer des cadres adaptés aux nouveaux paradigmes et (iii) l’audace collective 
d’innover. Et je voudrais partager avec vous quelques réflexions sur ces trois 
sujets. 
* 
(i) Le diagnostic 
La révolution digitale permet désormais à certaines entreprises de s’appuyer sur 
une base de clientèle potentielle équivalente à la population de l’Europe, des 
États-Unis et de la Chine réunis, pour faire des incursions marquées, et 
potentiellement systémiques, à ce jour principalement dans le domaine des 
paiements et des transferts de fonds.  
L’ampleur de ces effets de réseau ainsi que la vitesse avec laquelle ils peuvent 
être exploités sont susceptibles de changer radicalement le champ et l’intensité 
de la concurrence sur les marchés sur lesquels ils sont à l’œuvre. Ils peuvent 
aussi contribuer à exacerber l’ampleur des bénéfices mais aussi des risques 
qu’ils créent pour la stabilité du système financier et la stabilité monétaire. Ce 
constat doit-il nous conduire à chercher à préserver le statu quo ? Je vois au moins 
deux raisons pour ne pas nous engager dans cette voie. 
 
3 
 
La première, c’est que les technologies qui permettent ces changements d’échelle 
sont porteuses de progrès. Les révolutions technologiques, des débuts d’internet à la 
multiplication des protocoles blockchain en passant par l’intelligence artificielle, ont 
permis et peuvent encore apporter de nouveaux services, de nombreuses améliorations 
au quotidien pour le consommateur, notamment de services financiers y compris, et 
nous y sommes extrêmement attentifs, une meilleure inclusion financière.  
Deuxièmement, il n’y a pas de raison de considérer par principe que le cadre actuel 
de régulation des services financiers est intangible et ne peut être adapté aux 
changements, y compris d’échelle, apportés par l’innovation technologique. Un 
simple exemple : le parcours client proposé en France pour ouvrir un compte à distance, 
comparé à d’autres pays Européens, manquait de fluidité. Les acteurs rencontrés 
évoquaient souvent comme frein possible la transposition française de la 4ème directive 
européenne anti-blanchiment, qui ne permettrait pas d’exploiter pleinement les atouts de 
la technologie. Nous avons pris acte du problème et constitué un groupe de travail de 
place, piloté par le pôle Fintech – Innovation de l’ACPR dans le cadre du Forum Fintech 
ACPR-AMF et rassemblant prestataires technologiques, établissements financiers et 
autorités publiques. L’objectif poursuivi a été de co-construire des propositions basées 
sur un diagnostic objectif de la réglementation et de l’état de l’art technologique, tout en 
garantissant l’efficacité des dispositifs de LCB-FT. Le résultat est que ces propositions 
sont quasi-intégralement retenues pour la transposition de la 5ème directive. Nous 
savons penser hors du cadre établi lorsque cela est nécessaire. Toutefois, pour les 
projets susceptibles d’exploiter les effets de réseau de portée massive, et donc 
susceptibles de créer des risques significatifs pour la stabilité financière et monétaire, il 
serait prudent de s’assurer que les cadres de régulation sont parfaitement adaptés aux 
risques posés, et de les amender si nécessaire, avant le déploiement sur le marché de 
tels projets. 
Pour aider à mener à bien l’adaptation du cadre de régulation et de supervision à 
ces profonds changements, les Banques centrales et les superviseurs ont pour 
premier atout leur légitimité. Celle-ci tient tout d’abord à leurs mandats institutionnels : 
supervision prudentielle, stabilité financière, conduite de la politique monétaire. Notre 
légitimité tire également sa source dans notre expérience des crises et de nos 
contributions à leur résolution. Toutefois, pour être à la hauteur de cette légitimité, il est 
 
4 
 
nécessaire d’identifier les risques nouveaux dans leur nature comme dans leur 
ampleur et d’y apporter des réponses claires, fortes et pertinentes. 
* 
(ii) L’ouverture d’esprit est nécessaire pour atteindre cet objectif : elle doit nous 
conduire à proposer des cadres adaptés aux nouveaux enjeux et risques 
associés.  
Les spécificités des changements apportés par la révolution digitale et en 
particulier la portée multinationale des effets de réseau qu’elle permet, nous 
impose en outre de militer pour un renforcement de la coopération internationale 
entre autorités afin d’assurer une meilleure cohérence des cadres nationaux de 
régulation et de proposer des évolutions qui influencent la gouvernance 
mondiale. Pour illustrer ce propos, je prendrai un exemple en dehors du secteur 
financier proprement dit : celui du règlement général sur la protection des données 
personnelles, le RGPD. En instaurant un cadre commun de protection et de circulation 
des données personnelles, l’Union Européenne n’a pas seulement harmonisé sa 
règlementation et réaffirmé les valeurs qui lui sont propres, elle a également établi une 
référence mondiale en la matière, suscitant l’intérêt de nombreux partenaires, les États-
Unis notamment, ébranlés par des scandales à répétition dont le symbole reste 
Cambridge Analytica. 
Ainsi nos propositions et nos actions me paraissent devoir être guidées par deux 
principes.  
Tout d’abord, il nous faut penser en système ouvert. Nous devons tenir compte du 
développement des interactions de toutes natures entre les participants aux différents « 
écosystèmes » sur lesquels s’appuie désormais le développement de services 
financiers. C’est une condition sine qua non pour pouvoir prétendre légitimement 
en réguler les interconnexions. C’est aussi une condition sine qua non pour 
garantir un périmètre approprié des réglementations à adapter ainsi que la 
coordination et la cohérence au niveau national, européen et international de ces 
adaptations. 
Très concrètement, prenons l’exemple de l’Open Banking. Le cadre règlementaire offert 
par la deuxième directive sur les paiements, la DSP2, a permis d’enlever les barrières 
techniques et juridiques empêchant l’accès aux données des comptes de paiements. La 
 
5 
 
conséquence immédiate a été le développement d’un nouvel écosystème proposant au 
consommateur une kyrielle de nouveaux services. Pour autant, nous avons également 
imposé au niveau européen des exigences de protection des données élevées, en 
particulier dans les règles d’accès à ces informations.  
Deuxième principe : pour ne pas subir ou réagir au changement avec retard, nous 
devons assumer pleinement l’observation prospective, l’expérimentation, et 
l’engagement opérationnel. Dans le domaine des paiements, les récentes 
initiatives des BigTechs ayant une empreinte mondiale ont remis sur le devant de 
la scène l’inefficacité actuelle des solutions de paiements transfrontalières. 
Toutefois, les enjeux de stabilité financière, de politique monétaire et de 
souveraineté que soulèvent ces projets, doivent nous encourager à 
opérationnaliser nos efforts visant à promouvoir des systèmes de paiements plus 
efficients, le cas échéant en envisageant une implication opérationnelle des 
banques centrales, fondée sur une utilisation cohérente et coordonnée des 
nouvelles technologies.  
Dans le domaine des infrastructures, nos réflexions nous ont conduits à nous intéresser 
à la technologie blockchain dès ses prémices. C’est ainsi que nous avons été la 
première Banque centrale à développer, sur le cas d’usage spécifique des identifiants 
créanciers SEPA, un système de registre décentralisé basé sur un protocole blockchain, 
le registre « MADRE ». Ce n’est bien sûr qu’une étape, qui n’épuise pas un champ 
d’expérimentation extrêmement vaste et diversifié. La question qui se pose aujourd’hui 
est la suivante : quels systèmes pourraient gagner en efficacité ou en possibilités 
d’usage à une décentralisation technique ?  
Dans le domaine de la règlementation et de la supervision conduite par l’ACPR, nous 
nous sommes appliqué les mêmes principes. Prenons le cas de l’Intelligence Artificielle 
(IA). Comment définir concrètement les conditions d’un développement maîtrisé de 
l’intelligence artificielle et définir les principes de son contrôle ? C’est dans cet esprit que 
nous avons conçu nos ateliers IA : les experts Fintech de l’ACPR et les data scientists 
de la Banque de France sont allés à la rencontre d’acteurs établis pour comprendre leur 
perception de ces technologies et évaluer leur niveau de maturité. Tant dans les 
domaines de la LCB-FT, des modèles internes que de la protection du consommateur, 
les enseignements de ces entretiens et de ces tests en conditions de production nous 
 
6 
 
fourniront la connaissance indispensable à la construction d’un futur cadre favorisant la 
maîtrise des techniques d’Intelligence Artificielle. 
* 
(iii) Conscients de l’importance des enjeux et clairvoyants sur leur complexité, 
prêts à faire évoluer notre régulation et l’exercice de nos missions, il nous faut, en 
outre, être audacieux, c’est-à-dire innovants. Aussi, pour conclure cette 
intervention, je souhaiterais insister sur deux éléments primordiaux.  
Premièrement, la souveraineté financière européenne ne dépend pas seulement des 
autorités de ses États-Membres ou des réglementations portées par la Commission 
Européenne ; elle dépend avant toutes choses de la vitalité de l’écosystème européen 
et de l’effort d’innovation chez tous les acteurs, qu’ils soient établis ou entrants. Dans 
cette perspective, il est souhaitable que l’Europe des paiements exploite 
l’opportunité de la révolution digitale pour développer une solution pan 
européenne de paiement. Nos institutions font partie intégrante de cet écosystème 
européen et entendent y jouer pleinement leur rôle : le Lab de Banque de France, le 
pôle Fintech-Innovation de l’ACPR, avec son forum de place Fintech commun ACPR-
AMF, ainsi que l’ensemble des autorités publiques, sont pleinement mobilisées pour 
accompagner l’expansion et la croissance de cet écosystème. 
En second lieu, cette injonction à l’innovation, nous la prenons également pour 
nous-mêmes : nous ne pouvons atteindre nos objectifs et accompagner 
véritablement le marché que si nous sommes nous-mêmes innovants. À cet égard, 
nos projets sont et doivent rester nombreux. J’ai déjà cité MADRE, je souhaiterais faire 
ici une mention spéciale de notre analyse des « signaux faibles » par l’intelligence 
artificielle, pour détecter les entreprises fragilisées. Ce projet est exemplaire par la 
coopération qu’il implique entre une grande variété d’acteurs publics : la Direction 
générale des entreprises (DGE), la Délégation générale à l’emploi et à la formation 
professionnelle (DGEFP), l’Agence centrale des organismes de sécurité sociale 
(ACOSS) et la Direction interministérielle du numérique et du système d’information et 
de communication de l’État (DINSIC) et naturellement, la Banque de France.  
Notre recherche de l’innovation passe aussi par l’innovation dans les modes de travail et 
la mise en œuvre des projets : l’intrapreneuriat, que nous avons mis en place à l’ACPR, 
en est une bonne illustration. Il s’agit de mobiliser l’ensemble des collaborateurs, pour 
 
7 
 
faire émerger les innovations les plus adaptées à nos missions et les faire ensuite porter 
par des « intrapreneurs », qui se voient donner une grande autonomie, comparable à 
celle des start-uppers, pour le développement de leur projet. Notre premier programme 
d’intrapreneuriat nous permettra, je l’espère, de bénéficier d’ici 9 mois à un an d’outils 
d’intelligence artificielle pour conduire nos missions de supervision. 
Toutes ces initiatives sont aussi vitales que passionnantes. Elles sont l’ADN de nos 
institutions, et j’en suis convaincu, le reflet de celui de l’écosystème français et 
européen. 
Merci pour votre attention.

Conférence à Sciences Po Bordeaux 
18 octobre 2019 
Dix ans après Lehman, un système financier plus sûr ? 
 
Discours de Denis Beau, Premier sous-gouverneur1 
 
Un peu plus de dix ans après la faillite de Lehman Brothers, et alors que le système financier fait face 
à de nouveaux défis, quel est le bilan des réformes engagées après la crise de 2008 ? Le système 
financier est-il devenu plus sûr ? Au regard de l’ampleur des travaux accomplis par les régulateurs et 
les superviseurs et des efforts des intermédiaires pour s’adapter au cadre rénové réglementaire et de 
supervision qui en a résulté, au plan international comme aux plans européen et national, pour moi la 
réponse est incontestablement oui et je voudrais consacrer la première partie de mon exposé à 
développer les raisons qui me semblent plaider pour cette réponse positive. Mais il faut, à mon sens, 
pousser la question plus loin, ce que je me propose de faire dans la deuxième partie de mon exposé 
en posant la question suivante : le système financier est-il assez sûr ? Au vu de l’évolution des 
sources de vulnérabilités du système financier, il ne me semble pas acquis que le renforcement que 
nous avons observé soit suffisant et l’effort me paraît donc devoir être poursuivi. 
 
1. Dix ans après Lehman Brothers, le système financier est aujourd’hui plus sûr 
La crise qui a suivi la faillite de Lehman a montré l’importance d’un système financier solide, 
capable de résister aux chocs, sans que cela n’entrave le financement de l’économie. Les 
économies qui, après un choc macroéconomique, subissent un choc financier parce que leur 
secteur bancaire est trop fragile, connaissent des crises plus graves et plus longues. Cette leçon 
a conduit à un programme très important de réforme de la réglementation et de la supervision du 
système financier pour en corriger les nombreuses lacunes, vecteurs de vulnérabilités 
importantes.

particulier E. Rocher et S. Frappa

1.1. DE NOMBREUSES LACUNES DU CADRE RÉGLEMENTAIRE ET DE SUPERVISION 
ONT ÉTÉ RÉDUITES  
Une réforme globale a été ainsi menée, visant pratiquement toutes les composantes du système 
financier, articulée autour de 4 axes principaux :  
(a) Renforcer la résilience des institutions financières  
Pour les banques, sous l'impulsion du G20 et du Conseil de stabilité financière (FSB), le 
Comité de Bale a édicté de nouvelles règles prudentielles, dites « Bâle III », dont les 
principaux éléments visent à renforcer le niveau et la qualité des fonds propres, 
contraindre l’utilisation des effets de levier financier et introduire de nouvelles exigences 
en termes de liquidité, pour assurer la capacité des banques à faire face à des tensions à 
court terme sur leur refinancement et encadrer leur activité de transformation. Enfin, le 
cadre introduit pour la première fois un volet dit « macroprudentiel », constitué d’un 
coussin de capital contracyclique et d’une surcharge pour les banques d'importance 
systémique mondiale (surcroît de capital et de ratio de levier). 
La plupart des juridictions du G20 ont adopté ce cadre. En Europe les directives et 
règlements CRD/CRR transposent l’accord de Bale III. L’Europe a également ajouté, lors 
de la transposition de cet accord, des éléments additionnels : coussin de risque 
systémique, capital dit de « Pilier 2 » venant couvrir les risques non couverts ou non 
suffisamment couverts par la règlementation (risque général de taux, risque de 
gouvernance…), un encadrement des rémunérations, etc.  
Pour le secteur de l’assurance, un cadre prudentiel harmonisé est appliqué en Europe 
depuis 2016 : Solvabilité 2 a introduit le principe d’une réglementation basée sur les 
risques et les exigences quantitatives de capital ont été fortement renforcées.  
Au-delà du seul cadre règlementaire, le cadre institutionnel a été renforcé dans de 
nombreux pays. Des autorités macroprudentielles ont été mise en place (comme en 
France, dès 2010) pour veiller à la stabilité du système financier dans son ensemble et 
faciliter la coordination entre les différents superviseurs. En Europe, la création des trois 
autorités de supervision (2011) a permis de progresser dans l’adoption d’un corpus 
règlementaire unique (Single Rulebook). Enfin, dans la zone euro, la mise en place du 
Mécanisme de surveillance unique (MSU) depuis 2014 a permis d’harmoniser par le haut 
nos pratiques en matière de surveillance prudentielle du secteur bancaire. 
(b) Mettre un terme au « too big to fail », c’est-à-dire faire en sorte que, demain, une banque 
défaillante, même de taille importante, n’ait plus à être renflouée par des fonds publics. 
Depuis 2009, ces institutions qualifiées d'institutions financières d'importance systémique 
 
3 
 
(SIFIs - Systemically Important Financial Institutions) ont été définies comme celles dont 
« la faillite désordonnée, en raison de leur taille, complexité et de leur interconnexion 
systémique, causerait des troubles importants au système financier dans son ensemble et 
à l'activité économique ». Les banques désignées systémiques au niveau mondial par le 
FSB, et en France, au niveau domestique, par l’ACPR, font l'objet de mesures de 
supervision renforcées. Outre les surcharges en capital déjà évoquées, les banques 
systémiques doivent respecter des exigences spécifiques en matière d’élaboration de 
plans de rétablissement, pour faire face à des crises. Un plan de résolution pourra être mis 
en œuvre en cas d’insuffisance des mesures de rétablissement. Ce plan peut prévoir de 
recourir à un dispositif de renflouement interne dit de « bail in ». 
(c) Rendre les marchés de produits dérivés de gré à gré (OTC) plus sûrs : la crise 
financière de 2008 a démontré la solidité des infrastructures de marché. En particulier, les 
chambres de compensation ou « CCP » ont bien résisté. Ces entités jouent un rôle 
opérationnel très spécifique pour assurer la bonne fin des transactions de titres ou 
l’exécution des contrats de dérivés en s’interposant entre les contreparties. Elles se 
trouvent, de ce fait, au cœur du système financier. La gestion des risques très prudente 
des CCP et de l’existence de mécanismes de gestion des défauts de leurs participants 
limitent les phénomènes de contagion. La résilience des CCP a conduit les régulateurs 
internationaux à : (i) affirmer leur rôle central dans la maîtrise des risques portés par le 
système financier, la compensation multilatérale assurée par les CCP étant jugée plus 
sûre que la compensation bilatérale entre participants. Ceci s’est traduit par une extension 
de l’obligation de compensation à l’ensemble des dérivés OTC standardisés ; (ii) améliorer 
leur résilience en renforçant encore leur cadre de gestion des risques, la concentration de 
la compensation sur un nombre réduit d’entité nécessitant un cadre particulièrement 
robuste. 
Les principes applicables aux infrastructures de marché financiers ont par ailleurs été 
renforcés, avec les « principes pour les infrastructures de marchés financiers » (en 
anglais, PFMI), publiés en 2012. Il s’agit encore aujourd’hui du texte de référence en 
matière de régulation des infrastructures de marché. En Europe, la traduction en droit dur 
de ces PFMI s’est notamment opérée avec le règlement EMIR (adopté en 2014) 
applicable aux CCP et aux référentiels centraux de données. 
(d) Mieux réguler le système financier non bancaire pour permettre un financement de 
marché sain : il s’agit de renforcer la surveillance de la finance parallèle, ou « shadow 
banking », la crise financière ayant révélé que l’accumulation de risques en périphérie du 
système bancaire, parfois sans contrôle effectif, pouvait avoir des effets dévastateurs.         
 
4 
 
Nous connaissons aujourd’hui mieux le système financier non bancaire, grâce aux travaux 
de cartographie du FSB qui permettent de mesurer ses évolutions et les risques qui lui 
sont associés. Le FSB a également travaillé à un renforcement de la réglementation sur 
les fonds d’investissement, pour mieux encadrer le risque de liquidité (cf. les épisodes 
récents de sorties de capitaux massives de fonds britanniques et français ont démontré 
l’importance d’une bonne gestion de ce risque) et le risque de levier. Concernant les fonds 
monétaires (Money Market Funds), la réglementation européenne a permis de renforcer 
leur résilience face au risque de désengagement brutal et massif des investisseurs, et des 
exigences accrues de liquidité et de transparence sont en place depuis janvier 2018. La 
titrisation, qui avait pu apparaitre en 2008 comme un outil de propagation de la crise (via 
les subprimes), a fait l’objet de nouvelles règles prudentielles, permettant de mieux 
encadrer ses risques tout en favorisant un développement sain de cet instrument. Le 
nouveau cadre européen crée un label afin d’identifier les opérations de titrisation de 
meilleure qualité, respectant des critères de simplicité, de transparence et de 
standardisation (label STS). 
 
1.2. LA MISE EN ŒUVRE DE CES ÉVOLUTIONS RÉGLEMENTAIRES ASSOCIÉE AUX 
EFFORTS D’ADAPTATION DÉPLOYÉS PAR LES INTERMÉDIAIRES FINANCIERS ONT 
ÉTÉ ACCOMPAGNÉS PAR DES SIGNES TANGIBLES DU RENFORCEMENT DE LA 
RÉSILIENCE DU SYSTÈME FINANCIER.             
Pour le système financier européen, je voudrais en donner trois exemples. 
(a) Forte amélioration de la solvabilité et de la liquidité des banques    
Les fonds propres des grandes banques françaises ont presque triplé depuis la crise. 
Leurs ratios de fonds propres durs (CET1) ont augmenté de 5,8 % à 13,6 % entre 2008 et 
2018. Les banques européennes ont amélioré leurs ratios de liquidité à court terme, 
rattrapant voire dépassant leurs homologues à l’international dès 2015. L’évolution du ratio 
de liquidité à long terme pour les banques européennes évolue plus lentement mais se 
place fin 2018 autour de 110%, soit un niveau supérieur à l’exigence règlementaire 
baloise. 
Dans l’assurance, l’introduction de Solvabilité 2 s’est également traduite par une 
augmentation globale des fonds propres des assureurs européens. 
(b) Assainissement des bilans et réduction des NPL 
La persistance de niveaux élevés de prêts non performants dans certains pays de la zone 
euro pose différents problèmes, puisqu’ils constituent un frein à la rentabilité des banques 
 
5 
 
et génèrent des besoins de provisionnement qui pèsent sur le niveau de fonds propres, 
sans parler même d’un risque de viabilité pour les banques les plus fragiles. 
Mais depuis la mise en place du MSU, les grandes banques européennes ont globalement 
et significativement réduit leur encours de prêts non performants. Cet encours s’établissait 
ainsi à 587 Mds d’euros à fin mars 2019 contre plus de 1 000 Milliards d’euros fin 2014. 
Les banques françaises ont, pour leur part, toujours affiché de très bonnes performances 
par rapport à leurs homologues européennes : leur taux de prêts non performants s’est 
toujours placé sous la moyenne européenne, atteignant aujourd’hui 2,8 % (contre 3,1% 
UE). De plus, les banques françaises ont toujours affiché un ratio de couverture de ces 
prêts supérieur à 50% sur la période décembre 2009- juin 2019, soit bien au-dessus de la 
moyenne des banques européennes (45% dans l’UE).  
(c) Résultats des stress tests récents 
Les stress-tests (« tests de résistance ») prudentiels sont des exercices de simulation 
visant à évaluer l’impact d’un scénario économique et financier donné sur la situation 
prudentielle d’un établissement, pour en tester la solidité financière. Lors de la crise, ils ont 
d’abord servi d’outil de gestion de crise, afin d’identifier les banques les plus vulnérables 
pour lesquelles des mesures de recapitalisation s’imposaient. Leur rôle a ensuite évolué 
pour en faire un outil incontournable de supervision, flexible, de surveillance et de contrôle 
des risques et vulnérabilités des banques considérées individuellement (supervision 
microprudentielle) mais également à des fins de stabilité financière (supervision 
macroprudentielle). 
Les stress-tests ont ainsi contribué à un renforcement de la résilience du système 
financier : (i) les stress-tests permettent de renforcer les fonds propres des banques en 
servant d’assiette au calcul d’exigences additionnelles en capital (« Pillar 2 Guidance » ou 
P2G) ; (ii) la publication des résultats individuels des stress-tests, qui s’accompagne de la 
divulgation des données banque par banque, est gage de transparence et renforce la 
discipline de marché ; (iii) les exercices réguliers de stress-test sous l’égide du superviseur 
incitent les banques à développer leurs processus internes de gestion des risques et leurs 
outils d’information. 
La comparaison dans le temps des résultats agrégés des stress tests menés par l’EBA et 
la BCE permet aussi d’illustrer le renforcement des banques européennes. En cas de 
scénario adverse, le stress test de 2018 a montré que le ratio de solvabilité des banques 
s’établirait à 9,9%, soit 100 points de base au-dessus du niveau auquel aboutissait le 
stress test mené en 2016. 
 
6 
 
Il faut pour autant se garder de toute complaisance : des risques s’accroissent et, si 
certains évènements récents ont permis de confirmer la pertinence des instruments mis en 
place (cf. notamment l’incident H2O), le caractère finalement bénin ne préjuge pas d’une 
issue moins favorable dans un environnement de marché stressé. Le renforcement de la 
résilience du système financier doit donc être poursuivi.   
 
2. Un renforcement suffisant de la résilience du système financier n’est pas acquis  
2.1. LES VULNÉRABILITÉS ÉVOLUENT ET S’ACCROISSENT  
Le risque macroéconomique global est en nette hausse. La croissance mondiale connaît un 
ralentissement ainsi que de fortes incertitudes. Selon les dernières estimations du FMI, le PIB 
mondial devrait progresser de 3,0 % en 2019, contre 3,8 % l’an passé (FMI), sous l’effet du 
ralentissement de la croissance dans les pays émergents, notamment la Chine et dans une 
moindre mesure de certains pays avancés. Dans la zone euro, nos prévisions s’établissent à 
1,1 % en 2019, en baisse par rapport à 2018 (1,9 %). Les risques d’intensification des 
mesures protectionnistes et d’un Brexit sans accord, qui pourraient causer un resserrement 
des conditions financières en Europe, sont les principaux facteurs d’incertitude qui pèsent sur 
la croissance.  
Cette orientation à la hausse du risque macroéconomique contribue à entretenir et renforcer 
une orientation et des anticipations de taux d’intérêt bas pour longtemps et des politiques 
monétaires accommodantes. 
Cette environnement de taux bas encourage une progression de l’endettement des 
ménages et des entreprises, dans les économies avancées comme émergentes qui 
pourrait se relever une vulnérabilité en cas de choc. En France, l’endettement du secteur privé 
a atteint 132,3 % du PIB fin 2018 (+ 45 points de pourcentage depuis 2000). L’endettement 
des ménages a augmenté de 8 points de PIB depuis la sortie de la crise (59,8 % du PIB).  
Par ailleurs, en Europe la rentabilité des banques est sous la pression croissante de 
plusieurs facteurs de risques : 
- Le premier est le maintien d’un environnement de taux bas pour longtemps. Cet 
environnement n’est pas le seul fait des banques centrales : la politique monétaire 
accommodante est justifiée compte tenu de la situation économique en zone euro mais, 
au-delà de la situation conjoncturelle, les taux longs bas reflètent aussi une faiblesse 
structurelle de la croissance. Par ailleurs, la politique monétaire et la faiblesse des taux ont 
aussi effets favorables pour les banques, dont la diminution du coût du risque et 
l’augmentation des volumes de prêts. Il n’en reste pas moins que l’environnement actuel 
 
7 
 
pèse sur la marge nette d’intérêt des banques de détail qui se financent par des dépôts – 
et non à taux variable sur les marchés – comme il contribue à réduire le rendement des 
placements des assureurs ; 
- Le second, plus structurel, est celui de leur mutation digitale, qui révolutionne les usages et 
apporte beaucoup aux clients. L’adaptation à ce nouvel écosystème nécessite toutefois de 
gros investissements pour adapter les systèmes d’information et développer de nouveaux 
services personnalisés. Elle entraîne aussi une pression à la baisse sur les revenus en 
raison d’une concurrence accrue par l’arrivée de nouveaux entrants sur le marché (néo-
banques, GAFA, etc.). Face à cette situation, les établissements financiers doivent 
dégager de nouveaux gains de productivité, en explorant encore plus les voies de 
l’automatisation et de l’intelligence artificielle (IA) et en adaptant leurs réseaux d’agences à 
tous les niveaux (taille, effectifs, densités) ; 
- La transition digitale se traduit aussi par l’importance prise par le risque cyber et, plus 
largement, le risque opérationnel (vols à grande échelle, corruption de leurs données) 
auxquels les institutions financières sont plus que jamais exposées ; 
- Enfin, la prise en compte des risques liés au changement climatique constitue une 
exigence nouvelle pour les intermédiaires financiers, à laquelle ceux-ci doivent s’adapter, 
j’y reviendrai.  
 
2-2  POUR CONFORTER LA RÉSILIENCE DU SYSTÈME FINANCIER, IL FAUT DONC 
ACHEVER LE PROGRAMME DE RÉFORMES ET L’ADAPTER AUX NOUVEAUX 
RISQUES 
2.2.1. « Finir le travail » : achever le programme de réformes et assurer une mise en œuvre 
coordonnée au niveau mondial 
(a) Achever la mise en œuvre de Bâle III. Le 7 décembre 2017, le Comité de Bâle a adopté 
un accord important sur la finalisation de Bâle III. Ce texte parachève la refonte intégrale 
du dispositif prudentiel international, entreprise depuis 2009, en maintenant notamment la 
possibilité d’utiliser des modèles internes pour évaluer leurs risques, mais sous un 
ensemble de conditions strictes. Cet accord doit s’appliquer progressivement à partir de 
2022, pour une application complète en 2027. 
Dans l’UE, la transposition des accords bâlois se traduira par une modification du 
règlement CRR et de la directive CRD (CRR3/CRD6). La Commission a d’ores et déjà 
initié ces travaux législatifs en demandant à l’Autorité Bancaire Européenne (ABE) 
d’analyser l’impact de ces réformes sur le secteur bancaire et l’économie européenne.  
 
8 
 
La Banque de France et l’ACPR soutiennent le principe d’une mise en œuvre fidèle et 
complète des accords bâlois dans l’UE. Cette mise en œuvre doit être réciproque et se 
faire de manière harmonisée au niveau international. C’est une condition nécessaire pour 
assurer la stabilité du système bancaire mondial et pour garantir une égalité de 
concurrence entre les banques. Cette mise en œuvre devra également prendre en compte 
les spécificités de l’environnement économique et financier européen. 
(b) Finaliser l’adoption d’un cadre européen de résolution des CCP et des assurances 
La résolution des CCP est le dernier grand thème de travail à l’agenda du FSB. En effet, 
en renforçant le rôle central des CCP sur les marchés, le nouveau cadre est susceptible 
de créer des entités « too big to fail » : il est donc nécessaire de disposer d’outils 
permettant de gérer efficacement les crises que pourraient traverser les CCP sans recourir 
à un « bail out », c’est-à-dire un renflouement opéré par l’État et faisant au final peser le 
coût du défaut sur les contribuables. Un cadre international de résolution des CCP est 
ainsi en cours de finalisation au niveau du FSB et fera l’objet d’un nouveau règlement au 
niveau européen.  
Dans le domaine des assurances, la France est l’un des premiers États membres de l’UE 
à s’être dotée d’un régime de rétablissement et de résolution des organismes d’assurance, 
avec la loi Sapin 2 du 9 décembre 2016. L’ordonnance du 27 novembre 2017 a par 
ailleurs donné de nouvelles compétences au Collège de résolution de l’ACPR qui peut 
ouvrir une procédure de résolution et prendre des mesures de résolution afin de maintenir 
la continuité des fonctions critiques exercées par l’organisme d’assurance défaillant ou 
préserver la stabilité financière. Le dispositif comprend un volet préventif, avec l’obligation 
pour les organismes d’assurance les plus importants d’élaborer des plans préventifs de 
rétablissement. Au plan européen, il n’existe pas à ce jour d’approche partagée sur la 
résolution des organismes d’assurance. La mise en place d’un tel cadre réglementaire 
apparaît cependant nécessaire afin de faciliter la résolution des organismes d’assurance, 
en particulier des groupes transfrontaliers, et contribuerait à renforcer le marché européen 
de l'assurance, au bénéfice des assurés. 
(c) Enfin, c’est aussi et surtout à mon sens « l’heure de la politique macroprudentielle ». 
Les nombreux instruments développés depuis la crise doivent aujourd’hui trouver leur 
pleine mesure dans la préservation de la stabilité financière. C’est ce qui est fait par 
exemple, en France avec l’activation progressive des coussins contracycliques ou de 
mesures limitant l’exposition des principales banques à des grandes entreprises très 
endettées.  
 
 
9 
 
2.2.2. Adapter le cadre de régulation aux nouveaux risques  
Au-delà de l’application des normes réglementaires, le superviseur doit bien entendu suivre 
l’évolution des modèles d’affaires, dans la perspective d’identifier les risques émergents, les 
surveiller et imaginer les éventuelles réponses à y apporter. 
 
 
Plusieurs nouvelles zones de risques sont ainsi particulièrement suivies : 
- En matière de cyber risque, les solutions envisagées, notamment en termes de cyber 
résilience, restent à harmoniser et à coordonner au niveau international, afin de maintenir 
un cadre réglementaire clair et cohérent pour tous les acteurs financiers. La Banque de 
France a fait de la rationalisation et de l’harmonisation des travaux normatifs en cours un 
sujet essentiel de la présidence française du G7 cette année. Dans ce cadre, un exercice 
de cyber résilience a été conduit en juin 2019 entre 23 autorités (ministères des Finances, 
banques centrales, superviseurs bancaires et des marchés) dans le but de renforcer leur 
capacité opérationnelle à faire face à un incident cyber majeur impactant le système 
financier mondial. L’organisation de cet exercice, très complexe par nature et qui 
constituait une première au niveau mondial, a marqué une grande avancée en matière de 
coopération internationale. Grâce à son succès, les autorités du G7 ont convenu d’établir 
un programme d’exercices pour les prochaines années. 
- Les FinTech et les BigTech (représentées notamment par de grandes entreprises 
américaines ou asiatiques qui sont les moteurs de la digitalisation de l’économie) 
apparaissent autant comme des opportunités nouvelles (nouvelles solutions de cyber 
sécurité, baisse des coûts de gestion internes pour les entités clientes, augmentation de 
l’inclusion financière…) que comme des sources de vulnérabilité supplémentaire, 
notamment en matière de risque cyber, de fragilisation des écosystèmes financiers ou de 
développement d’usages des données discutables. La Banque de France travaille 
activement sur ces sujets au sein des instances internationales et européennes, dans une 
optique de partage d’expérience, d’harmonisation des règles et des pratiques et de 
poursuite des initiatives en cours pour renforcer la résilience des acteurs de la sphère 
financière.  
- Nous devons également poursuivre l’évaluation des réformes déjà mises en œuvre afin 
de vérifier qu’elles produisent bien les effets attendus, tout en identifiant leurs 
conséquences inattendues. L’évaluation faite par le FSB montre que si certaines mesures 
ont largement été mises en œuvre –exigences relatives aux établissements d’importance 
 
10 
 
systémique, compensation–, d’autres aspects doivent être finalisés, notamment en matière 
de suivi des institutions financières non bancaires (Non-banking financial institution). Seule 
une mise en œuvre complète des réformes permettra de protéger efficacement le système 
financier. 
- Les projets d’intégration au niveau européen sont également essentiels pour 
augmenter la résilience macroéconomique de l’UE. Il faut d’abord finaliser 
institutionnellement l’Union bancaire. Dans cette perspective une contribution positive 
serait de travailler à un système européen de garantie des dépôts. Celui-ci pourrait être 
fondé au moins dans un premier temps sur la couverture des besoins de liquidité, sans 
transferts permanents entre États membres. Nous devons également nous assurer de 
l’application harmonisée de la réglementation bancaire dans tous les pays de l’Union 
bancaire et éviter tout risque de fragmentation qui viendrait réduire les gains attendus de 
l’Union bancaire. L’intégration des marchés financiers en Europe doit également être 
encore renforcée. Le plan d’action pour une Union des marchés de capitaux (UMC), lancé 
par la Commission en 2015, a permis quelques avancées, avec la création de fonds 
européens transfrontières et d’un produit d’épargne retraite pan-européen. Nous devons 
aller plus loin, avec la mise en place d’une véritable Union de financement pour 
l’investissement et l’innovation, qui doit permettre de mieux employer l’excédent 
d’épargne européen (3% du PIB) au profit de l’investissement productif, en confortant les 
fonds propres des entreprises et leur capacité de développement et d’innovation. Pour 
cela, il est nécessaire de (i) faciliter les investissements transfrontières en harmonisant les 
règles comptables, fiscales et celles régissant les faillites ; (ii) développer les incitations 
aux financement en fonds propres ; (iii) développer des titres et des produits d’épargne 
européens (fonds de capital-risque, obligations vertes, portefeuilles titrisés…) orientés vers 
des financements de long-terme et diversifiés entre les États membres. 
- Enfin, forte de son engagement international sur la question climatique, l’Europe doit jouer 
pleinement son rôle au sein des initiatives pour faire face aux risques liés au 
changement climatique. La Banque de France a été à l’origine du réseau des banques 
centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système financier (NGFS, Network 
for the Greening of the Financial System), réseau dont elle assure le secrétariat et qui 
compte à ce jour 42 membres et 8 observateurs, représentant 5 continents. Ce réseau vise 
à partager les meilleures pratiques et à émettre des recommandations à destination des 
banques centrales et des superviseurs afin de mieux intégrer les risques liés au climat 
dans le suivi de la stabilité financière et la supervision microprudentielle. Dans le cadre du 
NGFS, l’ACPR et la Banque de France ont amorcé une réflexion sur la conduite de stress-
tests climatiques. En parallèle, l’ACPR a publié deux rapports sur les risques climatiques 
 
11 
 
pour les secteurs bancaires et assurantiels français, en application de la loi de transition 
énergétique, et vient également de mettre en place une Commission Climat et Finance 
durable dont le but sera d’assurer un suivi des engagements pris par les institutions 
financières et d’en publier chaque année les résultats dans un rapport préparé 
conjointement avec l’AMF. 
 
**** 
 
Ma conclusion est donc que le renforcement significatif de la solidité du système financier au cours 
de la décennie écoulée ne doit pas nous conduire à tenir pour acquis que ce renforcement est 
suffisant.  
Plus que jamais la vigilance doit rester de mise, afin de faire face aux différentes sources de 
risques pouvant mettre à mal la stabilité financière. Cela passe par une supervision exigeante et 
par la mise en œuvre d’une approche multilatérale et coordonnée pour mettre en œuvre et 
compléter les réformes de régulation financière. La préservation de la stabilité financière, au 
bénéfice d’un système financier durablement plus sûr, est un enjeu global qui appelle une réponse 
globale.

11ème Conférence internationale de l’assurance   
Paris, 25 octobre 2019 
« Assurer le long-terme dans un monde de court-terme » 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr).

Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux de participer à cette 11ème conférence internationale de 
l’assurance… il s’agit d’un rendez-vous annuel incontournable – le quatrième 
pour moi – mais le premier pour vous, chère Florence. Je vous présente avec 
Bernard Delas, mes vœux chaleureux de réussite à la tête de la Fédération 
française de l’assurance (FFA). De notre côté, les choses bougent également ; 
et je tiens, ce soir, à saluer la nomination de Dominique Laboureix comme 
Secrétaire général de l’ACPR, avec à ses côtés Patrick Montagner, premier 
Secrétaire général adjoint que vous connaissez bien.  
Le sujet de votre 11ème conférence « Assurer le long-terme dans un monde de 
court-terme » résume bien le bel enjeu du métier d’assureur. Je veux d’emblée 
rendre hommage aux 712 organismes d’assurance agréés qui jouent, sans 
faillir, un rôle clé dans le financement de notre économie, avec 
2 600 Mds d’euros de placements. Le marché français est ainsi devenu en 2018 
le 1er marché européen de l’assurance devant le Royaume-Uni et l’Allemagne 
sur le critère du total bilan, et des primes non vie acquises. Il a également connu 
une bonne dynamique de développement avec une hausse du chiffre d’affaires 
de près de 3 % [2,7 % en assurance non vie et 3,1 % en assurance vie]. En 
réponse aux interrogations – légitimes – de beaucoup d’entre vous, j’ai choisi 
de centrer mon propos autour de deux préoccupations majeures : le défi des 
taux bas (I), et notre ambition pour la revue de Solvabilité II (II). 
*** 
I. Le défi des taux bas 
 
A. La situation économique nous impose de garder des taux bas 
J’ai marqué récemment les limites que devait à mon avis se fixer la politique 
monétaire. Je me dois d’autant plus de vous préciser pourquoi les taux bas sont 
nécessaires, et vont durer, et comment nous devons ensemble nous y adapter. 
J’entends, et je comprends vos inquiétudes relatives aux taux bas. Toutefois, il 
est important de ne pas perdre de vue la perspective à long terme: les taux bas 
ne tiennent pas qu’à la politique monétaire, ils sont d’abord la conséquence de 
tendances structurelles de long terme, tenant notamment au changement de 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
l’équilibre entre un haut niveau d’épargne et un moindre investissement, 
changement lié au vieillissement de la population et au ralentissement de la 
productivité. Les taux bas sont ainsi le reflet du niveau historiquement bas de 
ce que les économistes appellent le taux d’intérêt naturel réel, R*, qui a baissé 
d’environ 2 points de pourcentage depuis 15 ans en zone euro comme aux 
États-Unis. 
En outre, nous traversons, depuis plusieurs mois, un refroidissement 
économique dont les causes sont largement extérieures à la zone euro. Selon 
le FMI, l’intensification des tensions commerciales amputerait le PIB mondial 
jusqu’à 0,8 point en 2020, du fait principalement de la montée de l’incertitude 
politique et la baisse en conséquence de la confiance des entrepreneurs. La 
croissance mondiale connaitrait en 2019 à 3 % son plus bas niveau depuis 
2008/2009. Dans l’ensemble, la zone euro est durement touchée, 
principalement en raison du poids de l’Allemagne, dont la croissance atteindrait 
au mieux 0,5 % cette année. Notre pays résiste nettement mieux avec une 
croissance attendue à 1,3 % cette année comme l’an prochain.  
J’ajoute un mot sur le Brexit ; même s’il y a un accord de retrait, tout restera à 
négocier en 2020 sur un éventuel accord commercial et son volet services 
financiers : l’incertitude Brexit va donc durer. Le suivi de la mise en œuvre des 
plans de contingence nous permet toutefois d’être confiants pour l’assurance 
française : de notre côté, nous sommes prêts à tous les scénarios. 
Ce contexte d’incertitude prolongée impose la poursuite d’une politique 
monétaire accommodante. Ce serait un contresens de relever les taux 
aujourd’hui. Quand il y a matière à un soutien de la demande, ce que révèle une 
inflation trop faible comme actuellement, il faut garder des politiques monétaires 
actives. C’est notamment le sens du renforcement de notre forward guidance, 
que nous avons réaffirmée hier au Conseil des Gouverneurs. Nous prévoyons 
désormais que le taux plancher de la BCE demeurera à son niveau actuel de –
0,5 %, ou à un niveau plus bas, jusqu’à ce que les perspectives d’inflation 
convergent durablement vers un niveau suffisamment proche de, mais inférieur 
à 2 %. La nouveauté n’est donc pas les taux bas, ni même les taux négatifs : 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
elle est que ces taux bas vont durer et doivent durer compte tenu du 
refroidissement économique mondial.  
L’environnement actuel de taux d’intérêt bas a aussi des effets positifs qui ne 
doivent pas être sous-estimés. Si la BCE n’avait pas agi en baissant les taux 
d’intérêt, et en achetant des actifs, il y aurait aujourd’hui entre 1 et 1,5 point 
d’inflation de moins en zone euro au cours de la période 2015-2018 mais surtout 
moins de croissance (de l’ordre de 2,5 points), et moins d’emplois en France et 
en Europe. La profession de l’assurance, comme la banque, a intérêt à ce 
meilleur environnement économique. Depuis 2013, la zone euro a créé 
11 millions d’emplois. Mario Draghi, dont le mandat s’achève jeudi prochain, a 
été plus qu’un grand Président de la BCE, un grand serviteur de l’Europe. 
 
B. Cet environnement de taux bas appelle vigilance et adaptation 
  
Toutefois, et c’est un fait indéniable, puisqu’il est mécanique, les taux bas 
mettent sous pression le ratio de couverture du SCR des assureurs européens. 
Le ratio de solvabilité avait été stable en 2018, autour de 240 % en moyenne, 
mais le premier semestre 2019 a vu c’est vrai une diminution sensible à 225 % 
[T2 2019]. Ce niveau reste élevé et atteste de la bonne résilience d’ensemble 
des assureurs : il leur donne la durée et la capacité de l’adaptation 
indispensable. Depuis plusieurs années déjà, l’impact des taux bas sur la 
solvabilité des assureurs, et plus particulièrement ceux actifs sur des risques 
longs, constitue une priorité de contrôle du superviseur. L’ACPR a encore 
renforcé cette année sa supervision de la gestion du risque de taux bas en 
assurant un « suivi rapproché continu » des organismes les plus exposés. Dans 
ce contexte, j’appelle les organismes d’assurance à amplifier leurs efforts dans 
deux directions : la baisse des taux servis et la diversification des produits et du 
modèle d’affaires. 
La baisse des taux de revalorisation – de 0,17 % ou 17 points de base en 
moyenne par an depuis 2011 – doit être poursuivie et amplifiée après avoir été 
interrompue l’an dernier. Pour faire face à leurs engagements de long terme de 
façon sécurisée, les assureurs doivent – impérativement – répercuter la baisse 
du rendement de leurs placements sur la rémunération des contrats 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
d’assurance vie. Or, les taux servis sur les contrats en cours sont aujourd'hui 
encore élevés : 1,8 % en moyenne.  
Parallèlement, seule la diversification des produits permettra de tenir 
l’exigence de rendement sur le long-terme. Les unités de compte (UC) 
représentent plus du quart des versements réalisés en septembre 2019, mais 
ne comptent que pour 7 % de la collecte nette. Sur les nouvelles 
souscriptions, la discussion est d’actualité : s’agissant des abondements des 
contrats existants, ils doivent naturellement respecter les prescriptions 
contractuelles. S’agissant de nouveaux contrats ou de nouveaux versements 
libres, ils ne doivent pas avoir pour effet de trop diluer le rendement dont 
bénéficient les anciens assurés. Le devoir de conseil s’impose ici : il doit être 
personnalisé en fonction de chaque client et de sa situation, mais le bon conseil 
est rarement d’investir à 100 % en fonds euros, ou à 100 % en unités de compte. 
Je fais donc appel à votre capacité d’innovation afin de promouvoir des offres 
qui pourraient construire, avec l’eurocroissance et l’épargne-retraite, une 
gamme de placements dont le risque est encadré, située entre les produits 
euros et les UC. Nous sommes prêts, à l’ACPR, à faciliter ces initiatives en 
soutenant les demandes d’aménagements réglementaires qui s’avéreraient 
nécessaires, et sans exclure des recalibrations de la fiscalité entre les différents 
produits. 
Mais plus largement, dans une perspective de moyen terme, c’est le modèle 
d’affaires des assureurs vie qui doit être repensé. Nous devons y réfléchir 
ensemble et nous préparer à utiliser tous les leviers susceptibles 
d’accompagner cette mutation.  
 
II. Notre ambition pour la revue de Solvabilité II 
J’en viens maintenant à votre deuxième préoccupation majeure : Solvabilité II. 
Nous entrons dans une période de consultation tout à fait cruciale qui aboutira 
en juin prochain à un avis de l’EIOPA. Cet avis, revu par la Commission, servira 
de base aux négociations avec le Conseil et le Parlement qui s’ouvriront au 
début de l’année 2021.  
Page 5 sur 6 
 
Ici encore, remettons en perspective les défis posés par Solvabilité II. Je 
rappelle qu’il s’agit de la réforme la plus ambitieuse jamais conçue pour 
l’assurance. Ce nouveau cadre réglementaire, fondé sur une approche de tous 
les risques auxquels les assureurs sont exposés, a incontestablement renforcé 
la solidité du marché européen de l’assurance.  Pour autant, et vous le vivez au 
quotidien, les exigences prudentielles imposées par Solvabilité II pêchent, entre 
autres, par volatilité et complexité. Pour y remédier, saisissons la fenêtre 
d’opportunité offerte par la revue de la directive pour promouvoir quatre priorités 
essentielles pour la stabilité financière, et le bon financement de l’économie : 
(i) La révision ne doit pas conduire, toutes choses étant égales par 
ailleurs, à l’augmentation des exigences en fonds propres qui pèsent 
sur le secteur européen de l’assurance.  
(ii) Il serait contre-productif de vouloir baisser artificiellement l’exigence de 
capital requis en renonçant à des investissements en actions. Or, malgré 
les avancées obtenues en 2018, c’est une classe d’actifs qui reste 
pénalisée. Nous appelons donc à une réduction du choc appliqué aux 
différentes catégories d’action, afin de faciliter la lecture de la norme, et 
diminuer la charge en capital. « Assurer le long-terme », pour revenir à 
notre sujet du jour, c’est précisément permettre à nos ETI et à nos PME 
d’avoir davantage accès au levier financier des actions. Or notre 
économie, comme celle de nos voisins de la zone euro, accuse un retard 
significatif dans ce domaine : les fonds propres ne représentent que 79 % 
du PIB en zone euro en 2019 contre 122 % aux États-Unis.   
(iii) Le poids de la marge pour risque, qui représente en moyenne 30 % des 
exigences en capital au niveau européen, doit être réduit. La méthode 
actuelle de calcul est excessivement prudente et pénalise la fourniture de 
produits d’assurance de long terme, tels que les produits d’épargne, de 
retraite et de prévoyance. 
(iv) Nous devons, enfin, aller vers davantage de simplification : « Ce qui est 
simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l’est pas est inutilisablei ». Ce constat, 
imparable, de Paul Valéry doit nous inciter à promouvoir des actions 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
concrètes pour simplifier les normes et faire converger les pratiques de 
supervision. Je pense à l’allègement des reportings et des exigences 
pesant sur les activités présentant des risques faibles. Je pense, de 
manière plus structurelle, à la trop grande complexité des modalités de 
calcul des provisions mathématiques qui nuit à la comparabilité des bilans 
prudentiels. 
Dans ce contexte de bouleversement normatif, le déploiement prématuré 
d’IFRS 17 serait tout à fait malvenu. Laissons du temps au temps ; et accordons 
un peu de répit aux assureurs afin qu’ils s’approprient les réglementations et 
anticipent, au mieux, les exigences futures. Ce délai supplémentaire serait 
également utile à l’IASB [International Accounting Standards Board] afin qu’il 
intègre pleinement les préoccupations européennes dans un contexte de taux 
bas. 
*** 
Ma conclusion visera une conviction, que j’espère partagée : ces combats, nous 
les portons collectivement pour l’industrie de l’assurance, qui est un acteur 
clé de l’économie. Nous les portons pour la protection des assurés qui est une 
responsabilité essentielle de l’ACPR. Nous les portons, enfin, pour préparer 
l’avenir et faire face à ses besoins colossaux d’investissement. Au-delà des 
taux bas, l’assurance a donc un rôle essentiel à jouer dans ce monde qui, plus 
encore que d’être « de court terme », est en bouleversement majeur. 
Bouleversement climatique d’abord, et je salue le groupe « finance durable » 
de l’EIOPA, co-présidé par l’ACPR, qui modifiera aussi Solvabilité II pour mieux 
intégrer les risques associés au changement climatique dans la gouvernance et 
la gestion des risques des organismes. Bouleversement numérique, ensuite, 
qui transforme en profondeur vos métiers, et pose des questions cruciales en 
matière de protection des données des assurés ou de montée des risques cyber 
et de leur assurance. Oui, ce monde a bien besoin d’assurance. Je vous 
remercie de votre engagement et de votre attention.

Journée de l’économie 2019 Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken – Francfort, 14 
novembre 2019 
Le futur de l’Union économique et monétaire européenne 
 
Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr ; 06 88 56 54 03).

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous et je vous remercie de m’avoir invité. Je 
me sens ici presque comme chez moi : je viens à Francfort au moins deux fois 
par mois pour les réunions du Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE ! J’ajoute que 
j’ai moi-même été banquier de détail, pendant douze ans. Aujourd’hui, je 
m’exprime aussi comme Européen convaincu et ami de l’Allemagne. Je suis 
Français, mais mes racines familiales sont en Sarre. Ma famille y vit depuis la 
fin du 18e siècle et sa manufacture de céramique Villeroy & Boch fait partie du 
« Mittelstand » allemand. J’aime l’Allemagne, sa langue, sa culture.  
Le nombre – impressionnant – de participants à cette journée témoigne de la 
vitalité des Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken. Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen et 
Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch [fondateur des Volksbanken] ont par leurs idées 
influencé de nombreuses initiatives de banques coopératives en Europe, et 
partout dans le monde. Le modèle coopératif a fait preuve de sa résilience, 
d’abord parce qu’il suscite la confiance dans la durée. Ces deux valeurs clés 
que sont la confiance et la stabilité, c’est aussi ce qui caractérise notre monnaie 
unique, l’euro. Il a fêté ses vingt ans cette année. Pour en optimiser 
objectivement les bénéfices, il nous faut cependant surmonter quatre clichés. 
Puis, j’en viendrai à votre industrie bancaire et à ses trois grands défis de 
demain.  
** 
I. Surmonter quatre clichés pour optimiser la zone euro.  
Je suis pleinement conscient des critiques et des débats qui existent ici en 
Allemagne, sur le fonctionnement de la zone euro. Tout n’est pas parfait ; mais 
l’Allemagne peut être fière d’avoir contribué à créer une monnaie mondiale 
reconnue qui s’est inspirée de ses valeurs : l’indépendance, le respect des 
Traités, la stabilité des prix et une approche de long terme. La BCE et l’euro 
sont de vrais héritiers de la Bundesbank et du Deutsche Mark. Mais aujourd’hui, 
si nous voulons avancer avec un débat serein, nous devons nous affranchir de 
quatre clichés.  
Page 2 sur 7 
 
Le premier cliché qu’il faut dépasser, y compris pour certains dans mon pays, 
c’est l’idée – paresseuse – selon laquelle l’Union économique serait un 
substitut aux réformes nationales. Je veux le redire d’emblée : les réformes 
nationales sont au contraire une condition préalable à tout renforcement de 
l’Union économique. Je le dis en tant que banquier central totalement 
indépendant ; le gouvernement français actuel prend les réformes très au 
sérieux. La France en tire déjà les premiers bénéfices : les fortes créations 
d’emplois – 1 million au cours des quatre dernières années – abaissent le 
chômage ; la croissance – attendue à 1,3 % cette année – résiste mieux 
qu’ailleurs en zone euro. Et la France est devenue un pays très attractif pour les 
investisseurs internationauxi. Regardons autour de nous : dans ce monde hélas 
si turbulent, il n’y a pas aujourd’hui de partenaire plus fiable pour l’Allemagne 
que la France, et pour la France que l’Allemagne.  
Et donc – c’est le deuxième cliché –, il faut cesser de réduire le débat à une 
vieille opposition entre les « règles allemandes » et les « dépenses 
françaises ». Face à des craintes allemandes que je comprends, je veux ici 
m’engager clairement : il n’est pas question à mes yeux de mettre en place une 
« union de transferts » qui ne profiterait qu’à certains pays, ni des Eurobonds 
qui reviendraient à mutualiser les dettes. Est-il besoin de rappeler que la France 
est aussi un pays contributeur net au budget européen et que son déficit public 
est significativement inférieur à la limite des 3 % ? Cependant, dans un contexte 
de dégradation des perspectives économiques, les pays disposant d’une marge 
de manœuvre budgétaire doivent « agir avec efficacité et rapidité », selon le 
Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE qui a été unanime sur ce point en 
septembre. Les études économiques montrent que les dépenses publiques ont 
davantage d’impact sur l’économie quand trois conditions sur réunies : (i) quand 
les dépenses se portent davantage sur les investissements publics productifs 
tels que les infrastructures et la R&D plutôt que sur les dépenses courantes ; (ii) 
ensuite quand la politique monétaire est proche de la borne inférieure sur les 
taux d’intérêt, car les effets d’éviction sur l’investissement privé sont moindres  
;  (iii) et enfin quand les pays ont une dette publique faible. À l’heure actuelle, 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
ces conditions sont toutes réunies dans plusieurs pays de la zone euro, et 
notamment en Allemagne.  
J’ajoute un paradoxe qui n’est pas assez connu : pour sortir de l’environnement 
actuel de taux bas, il ne faut pas se tourner instinctivement uniquement vers la 
politique monétaire – comme beaucoup le font. Dans les pays avancés, le taux 
d’intérêt naturel – celui qui assure l’équilibre à long terme entre épargne et 
investissement – a baissé d’environ 2 points de pourcentage au cours des vingt 
dernières années et la politique monétaire n’a qu’un effet très limité sur celui-ci. 
Il faut plutôt changer les facteurs économiques structurels associés à la baisse 
du taux d’intérêt naturel. Agir sur ces facteurs structurels nécessite des 
dépenses d’investissement et d’avenir, y compris dans l’éducation et la 
formation, la transition énergétique, et bien sûr les nouvelles technologies, 
visant à accroitre la croissance économique de long terme. Si on souhaite des 
taux d’intérêt plus élevés dans le futur, il ne faut donc pas avoir peur d’activer 
rapidement des politiques budgétaires et structurelles ciblées.  
Venons-en au troisième cliché : les autres pays ont gagné plus que nous à 
l’euro. Ce cliché existe malheureusement partout, y compris en Allemagneii. 
C’est une idée paradoxale, alors même que la monnaie unique jouit d’un soutien 
historiquement élevé en zone euro – 76 % des citoyens européens soutiennent 
l’euro et ce chiffre atteint même 81 % en Allemagne. En réalité, l’euro a été 
bénéfique à tous les pays, y compris – et surtout – à l’Allemagne. L’inflation en 
Allemagne a été plus faible sous l’égide de la BCE lors de ces vingt dernières 
années que pendant les deux décennies précédentes : 2,9 % en moyenne entre 
1979 et 1998 contre 1,4 % depuis 1999. La stabilité définitive des changes entre 
nos économies est un atout incontestable pour les entreprises allemandes 
exportatrices : en 2018, l’Allemagne a effectué 36 % de ses exportations au sein 
de la zone euro. Les taux bas eux-mêmes reflètent en partie le fort excédent 
d’épargne allemand.  Et la Suisse, autre pays très excédentaire mais qui ne fait 
pourtant pas partie de l’euro, doit pratiquer des taux d’intérêt encore plus 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
négatifs ! N’en doutons pas : l’euro est un atout, et non un fardeau pour 
l’Allemagne.  
J’en viens enfin au quatrième cliché : la politique monétaire de la BCE a trahi 
son mandat. Cette idée a été relayée dans un récent « mémorandum » 
d’anciens banquiers centraux. J’ai un grand respect pour leurs personnes, mais 
je suis en désaccord avec leur thèse. Ils ont malheureusement occulté les 
résultats positifs des politiques monétaires non conventionnelles. Jean-Claude 
Trichet lui-même, peu suspect de laxisme, les a soulignés et je voudrais ici les 
rappeler :  les estimations de l’efficacité des politiques de la BCE sont de l’ordre 
de 2,5 points de pourcentage pour la croissance et entre 1 et 1,5 point de 
pourcentage pour l’inflation au cours de la période 2014-2018. Par ailleurs, 
depuis 2013, la zone euro a créé 11 millions d’emplois.  
On peut ne pas aimer les taux bas ; d’ailleurs les marchés anticipent, 
raisonnablement me semble-t-il, que les niveaux des taux courts ne sont pas 
loin de leur point bas. Mais on ne doit pas avoir de doute sur deux réalités qui 
nous rassemblent au Conseil des gouverneurs. Nos décisions sont guidées par 
notre seul mandat de stabilité des prix, face à une inflation aujourd’hui trop faible 
en dessous de 1 %. Et compte tenu du ralentissement économique – à 
commencer par l’Allemagne –, ces taux de court terme bas vont durer et doivent 
durer : ce serait un contresens de relever les taux de la BCE aujourd’hui. 
Comme nous sommes tous ici des réalistes, autant donc nous concentrer sur 
deux questions :  
- La première est de clarifier la définition de l’objectif d’inflation de la BCE, et 
surtout de mieux la faire partager aux agents économiques – entreprises et 
ménages.  C’est crucial pour mieux ajuster leurs anticipations d’inflation ; 
c’est le sens de la revue stratégique que nous allons lancer autour de 
Christine Lagarde.  
- La seconde question est de limiter les effets négatifs de ces taux bas pour la 
stabilité financière, et en particulier pour les banques et les assurances. 
Nous ne manquons pas d’instruments, ni vous dans votre adaptation 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
stratégique, ni nous dans nos politiques « macroprudentielles ». Mais ceci 
m’amène à ma deuxième partie.  
II. Répondre à trois grands défis pour renforcer les banques de la zone 
euro.  
Je partage avec vous une conviction : l’Europe a besoin de banques fortes. Il 
n’est pas d’économie dynamique sans industrie bancaire solide ; c’est vrai en 
France, et c’est vrai en Allemagne. Indéniablement, les banques de la zone euro 
sont plus solides qu’il y a dix ans. Sous l’effet de la réglementation et de leurs 
efforts de gestion, leur bilan se sont fortement assainis avec en particulier un 
renforcement de leur solvabilité, de leur liquidité et une réduction très 
significative du poids des créances non performantes : leurs ratios de fonds 
propres durs (CET1) sont passés de 9 % fin 2009 à 14,6 % en juin 2019. Par 
ailleurs, les grandes banques allemandes elles-mêmes ont vu leur montant de 
NPL divisé par plus de deux depuis cinq ans : 33 Md€ à fin mars 2019 contre 
81 Md€ fin 2014iii. En revanche, les banques de la zone euro connaissent un 
sérieux problème de rentabilité, dont nous nous soucions, vous et nous. Je 
voudrais exposer trois défis qui sont souvent évoqués à ce propos : les taux 
bas, le défi digital, et la consolidation.  
Commençons par le sujet peut-être le plus évident pour vous : les taux bas. 
Les taux négatifs ne sont pas une fin en soi, et nous, banquiers centraux, 
sommes conscients des difficultés pour les banques. Je voudrais cependant 
nuancer ce constat. Tout d’abord, l’effet de la politique monétaire sur les 
banques ne se limite pas à une pression sur la marge nette d’intérêts. Il est plus 
large et comporte des aspects positifs trop souvent oubliés : des coûts de 
financement plus faibles ; un coût du risque en baisse en raison de l’amélioration 
de la solvabilité des emprunteurs. Ensuite, nous avons décidé en septembre – 
et j’avais plaidé en ce sens – un mécanisme d’atténuation, le tiering, qui 
exempte du taux négatif une partie de vos réserves excédentaires. L’Allemagne 
est le pays de la zone euro dont les banques affichent les plus forts excédents 
de liquidité : le tiering profitera donc d’abord aux banques allemandes, pour 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
plusieurs centaines de millions d’euros. C’est une bonne nouvelle, dont on n’a 
pas beaucoup parlé : je tiens d’autant plus à la saluer avec vous. Je note aussi 
que plusieurs pays – tels que le Danemark, la Suède ou même les Pays-Bas en 
zone euro – ont des taux négatifs mais des rentabilités bancaires en moyenne 
nettement supérieures à celles des banques de la zone euro – entre 9 et 11 % 
de RoE contre 6 % en zone euro. Les taux négatifs ne sont donc pas l’unique 
problème. Des problèmes plus structurels doivent également être résolus. 
Ceci m’amène au défi digital. La transition numérique est une stratégie 
importante de réduction des coûts. Les établissements financiers peuvent 
dégager des gains de productivité en explorant encore plus les voies de 
l’automatisation et de l’intelligence artificielle. Mais à court terme, les coûts liés 
aux investissements informatiques sont importants, tandis que les gains de 
rentabilité potentiels ne peuvent être générés qu'à moyen et long terme. Ce défi 
est d’autant plus complexe pour les banques de taille moyenne, et celles qui ne 
disposent pas de capacités financières suffisantes. Les coûts de la digitalisation 
– en investissement – sont fixes, pour l’essentiel ; ses gains augmentent à 
proportion de la taille.  
C’est ce qui m’amène au troisième défi, celui de la consolidation des 
établissements bancaires en zone euro. Le secteur bancaire européen, du fait 
d’une Union bancaire incomplète, reste trop fragmenté par rapport au marché 
américain : la part de marché des 5 principales banques européennes s’élève 
à 20 % contre plus de 40 % aux États-Unis. Je tiens à saluer à ce titre la 
démarche d’ouverture du Ministre fédéral des Finances Olaf Scholz. Au-delà du 
débat sur la garantie des dépôts qui appelle à mon sens un compromis 
pragmatique plutôt qu’un affrontement politique, il a eu trois mérites : d’abord 
de plaider pour une souveraineté financière européenne, après le Brexit ; ceci 
exige l’addition d’une Union bancaire plus forte et d’une Union des marchés de 
capitaux. Ensuite de proposer une procédure commune de liquidation des 
banques, pour traiter plus vite et efficacement les banques en difficulté. Enfin 
de dépasser les blocages des pays « hosts » de filiales, pour faciliter des 
Page 7 sur 7 
 
groupes bancaires européens transfrontières, y compris quand la maison-mère 
est allemande. Bien sûr, beaucoup de choses restent à négocier, dont la 
nécessaire réduction des risques. Mais les propositions Scholz remettent en 
mouvement ce dossier-clé pour la solidité de la zone euro, et le bon financement 
de l’investissement. 
Il existe bien sûr une diversité de modèles de consolidation en Europe, et dans 
ce mouvement, les petites banques ne doivent pas renoncer à leurs valeurs. À 
cet égard, votre organe central DZ Bank me semble être un bon exemple de 
regroupement qui assure une complémentarité géographique et fonctionnelle 
des activités. Je salue les réflexions en cours sur les modalités de consolidation 
des réseaux de banques coopératives et mutuelles en Europe ; le secteur 
allemand présente des atouts pour faire avancer cette réflexion. 
** 
J’ai découvert grâce à vous la belle phrase de Raiffeisen : « Plusieurs 
personnes ont la capacité de faire ce qui est impossible pour un individu. »iv 
Cette phrase décrit à merveille l’ambition des banques mutualistes. Mais c’est 
aussi, je crois, un modèle de pensée pour l’Europe. Dans ce monde incertain, 
bouleversé par la rivalité entre les États-Unis et la Chine, l’Allemagne et la 
France, plus que jamais, doivent dépasser leurs divergences. L’entrée en 
fonction de la nouvelle Commission européenne, autour d’Ursula von der Leyen, 
doit être une occasion d’aller de l’avant ensemble. C’est maintenant, ou c’est 
jamais. Les Européens n’en attendent pas moins. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Quelles sont les implications pour la stabilité financière  
de l’évolution récente des politiques monétaires ? 
 
Intervention de Denis Beau, Premier sous-gouverneur 
 
 
La stabilité financière à l’épreuve des taux bas1 
 
Sur le plan macro-économique et financier, la période récente a été marquée par une hausse du 
risque macroéconomique, un nouvel assouplissement des politiques monétaires et le développement 
d’anticipations de taux d’intérêt bas pour longtemps. Cette situation, que l’on n’anticipait guère il y a 
un an, soulève de nombreuses questions sur son origine et ses effets. Une dimension importante de 
ce débat est liée à ses enjeux en matière de stabilité financière auquel, comme banquier central et 
superviseur mandaté pour contribuer à assurer cette stabilité, je suis particulièrement intéressé et 
sensible. 
C’est donc avec cette perspective que j’ai centré mes remarques, que j’ai regroupées autour des 
trois questions suivantes : 
1/ De quoi parle-t-on et pourquoi les taux sont-ils si bas ? 
2/ Quels sont les enjeux de stabilité financière qui y sont associés ? et 
3/ Quel « policy-mix » pour y répondre ?

1. L’expansion rapide et mal anticipée d’un environnement de taux d’intérêt bas et pour 
longtemps (low for long)… 
Un changement d’orientation de la politique monétaire  
Depuis la fin de l’année dernière, nous sommes passé d’un scénario de normalisation de la 
politique monétaire qui accompagnait des perspectives de croissance mondiale relativement 
stables, à une orientation plus accommodante suite à une dégradation de l’environnement 
macroéconomique. 
Ainsi, les prévisions de croissance mondiale du FMI ont été systématiquement revues à la baisse 
depuis l’été 2018. La croissance anticipée était de 3,9 % pour 2019 et 3,8 % pour 2020 en avril 
2018. Les dernières prévisions (automne 2019) sont de 3,0 % et 3,4 % respectivement2. 
En zone euro, les perspectives macroéconomiques ont aussi été révisées à la baisse. Nous 
attendons actuellement une croissance de 1,1 % en zone euro en 2019 contre une prévision de 
1,9 % jusqu’en juin 2018 et 1,7 % à la fin de l’année dernière. Après un ralentissement plus fort 
et plus long que prévu, nous anticipons à présent une reprise progressive en 2020 et 2021 aussi 
bien pour le PIB (1,2 % puis 1,4 %) que pour l’inflation qui ralentirait en 2020 (1,0 %) mais 
resterait encore basse en 2021 (1,5 %)3. 
Dans ce contexte, la croissance française serait plutôt résiliente (1,3 % en 2019 et 2020, 1,4 % 
en 2021)4. 
Pourquoi cette dégradation inattendue de l’environnement économique ? 
Alors que la croissance américaine connait sa plus longue phase d’expansion jamais enregistrée, 
on a beaucoup débattu de la question de savoir si les cycles économiques « mouraient de 
vieillesse ». Ce n’est pas toujours le cas, en particulier en zone euro5 : le ralentissement observé 
actuellement est moins un épuisement de la croissance que la conséquence de chocs externes 
(tensions commerciales entre les États-Unis et la Chine, péripéties autour du Brexit, tensions 
politiques dans un certain nombre de pays émergents) et d’une incertitude très forte qui pèse sur 
l’investissement. 
Face à ces chocs, qui affectent non pas seulement la demande mais aussi l’offre, la première et 
meilleure réponse devrait venir des gouvernements eux-mêmes, en résolvant les problèmes à

l’origine des tensions et des incertitudes. Face à la dégradation des perspectives, les principales 
banques centrales ont néanmoins dû réagir en assouplissant leur politique monétaire. 
La BCE a ainsi décidé, en septembre dernier, une baisse du taux de la facilité de dépôt à -0,50% 
(assorti d’un un système de rémunération des réserves à deux paliers, tiering) en parallèle d’une 
reprise des achats nets dans le cadre du programme d’achats d’actifs (asset purchase 
programme, APP) et d’un changement de modalités pour les opérations trimestrielles de 
refinancement à plus long terme ciblées dites TLTRO3 (targeted longer-term refinancing 
operations) dans un sens plus favorable (amélioration du taux et extension de la maturité de 2 à 
3 ans). Elle a assorti cette décision d’un renforcement de sa forward guidance en indiquant en 
particulier qu’elle prévoyait « que les taux d’intérêt directeurs de la BCE resteront à leurs niveaux 
actuels ou à des niveaux plus bas jusqu’à ce qu’il ait été constaté que les perspectives d’inflation 
convergent durablement vers un niveau suffisamment proche de […] 2 % ». À ce stade, le marché 
juge possible une nouvelle baisse de 10 pb d’ici fin 2020. 
De son côté, la Fed a baissé par trois fois sa cible de taux de taux d’intérêt, le taux des Fed 
Funds, en juillet, en septembre et en octobre dernier, pour le ramener à 1,50 %-1,75 %, et ralenti 
le rythme de réduction de son bilan. Les marchés anticipent actuellement une baisse 
supplémentaire de 25 pb d’ici fin 2020. 
Les chocs qui ont affecté l’économie mondiale, associés au changement d’orientation des 
politiques monétaires, ont contribué à alimenter une forte translation à la baisse et un 
aplatissement de la courbe des taux d’intérêt depuis le début de l’année, qui s’est accentué au 
cours de l’été 2019 et ne s’est que marginalement corrigé depuis. 
Au total, nous avons ainsi vu se mettre en place de façon très largement inattendue, depuis la fin 
2018, au centre des anticipations des acteurs économiques et financiers un scénario de taux bas 
pour longtemps (low for long) ou plus bas pour plus longtemps qu’anticipé (lower for longer). 
Pourquoi les taux d’intérêts à long terme ont-ils baissé ? 
Avant d’évoquer les conséquences de cette évolution, il est nécessaire de revenir sur une 
question importante : les banques centrales sont-elles responsables de cet environnement 
macrofinancier ? 
Il est peut-être utile de remettre les évolutions récentes dans une perspective de moyen terme. 
La baisse des taux d’intérêt à long terme s’inscrit dans un mouvement de près de 40 ans qui 
correspond à une baisse du taux d’intérêt naturel (r*) qui s’explique par des facteurs structurels : 
ralentissement de la productivité, vieillissement démographique, excès d’épargne, etc.6 autant de 
                                                          
6 Pour une discussion générale, voir Garnier, Lhuissier et Penalver (2019) « Taux d’intérêt bas, quelle 
responsabilité de la politique monétaire ? », Risques, n. 120 p. 79-86, Décembre (à paraître). Sur l’évolution de 
r*, voir Holston, Laubach et Williams (2017) « Measuring the natural rate of interest: International trends and 
4 
 
facteurs sur lesquels une banque centrale a peu de prise et dont elle ne peut être tenue 
responsable : elle ne fait que s’adapter à ces changements structurels en ajustant son taux 
directeur en fonction de ce niveau plus bas du taux naturel. Ce dernier n’est pas directement 
observable et son estimation est incertaine mais, pour fixer un ordre de grandeur, il y a un 
consensus pour conclure à une baisse d’environ 200 pb depuis les années 90. 
Au-delà de la baisse du taux d’intérêt naturel, la politique monétaire fait aussi face à un défi 
nouveau. Depuis les années 80, son objectif avait été de lutter contre l’inflation ce qu’elle a fait 
relativement efficacement. En revanche, depuis la crise et dans un contexte de faiblesse 
persistante de l’inflation et de recul des anticipations, elle se retrouve à lutter non plus contre 
mais pour l’inflation. 
In fine, notre politique monétaire poursuit son objectif d’inflation de manière déterminée et nos 
décisions sont d’abord et avant tout guidées par la situation macroéconomique. Les taux d’intérêt 
sont donc appelés à rester bas pour longtemps non pas tant en raison des politiques monétaires 
en elles-mêmes, mais de changements durables dans les facteurs déterminant les taux d’intérêt 
et l’inflation. 
 
2. … dont les effets sur la stabilité financière se renforcent mutuellement… 
Cet environnement de taux bas pour longtemps produit une série d’effets sur les prix d’actifs 
comme sur les comportements financiers des ménages et des entreprises et sur la situation des 
intermédiaires financiers qui, du point de vue de la stabilité financière, peuvent se transformer en 
autant de vulnérabilités en cas de choc et devenir ainsi des vecteurs d’une nouvelle crise 
économique et financière. 
Des marchés plus sensibles à l’environnement de taux d’intérêt 
Le premier effet de la baisse de la courbe des taux sans risque a été d’entrainer avec elle une 
part importante du marché obligataire. Ainsi 60 % des titres souverains de la zone euro ont des 
taux de rendement négatifs mais une part significative (20 %) des obligations corporate de 
notation investment grade traite également en territoire négatif. 
En outre, les marchés obligataires ne sont pas les seuls à enregistrer des hausses de prix record. 
Les marchés d’actions ont enregistré des performances impressionnantes depuis le début de 
l’année (+20 % pour l’EuroStoxx 600, +23 % pour le S&P 500, +25 % pour le CAC 40 ou le DAX) 
                                                          
determinants », Journal of International Economics, 108 (supp. 1) pp S59-S75 (ainsi que le site 
https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar). 
Et s’agissant plus spécifiquement de la zone euro, on pourra se reporter à Claus Brand, Marcin Bielecki, Adrian 
Penalver (2018) « The natural rate of interest:   estimates, drivers, and challenges to monetary policy », ECB 
Occasional Paper Series, n. 217.

et affichent des niveaux de valorisation élevés (Price-Earning ratio de l’ordre de 18 pour 
l’EuroStoxx 600).  
On observe des évolutions similaires sur d’autres classes d’actifs (opérations de capital-
investissement, immobilier d’investissement, etc.). 
Globalement, il en résulte des prix des actifs financiers qui sont, dans leur ensemble, plutôt en 
ligne les uns avec les autres. Cela peut être tenu à la fois pour rassurant ou plutôt inquiétant 
puisqu’une correction simultanée sur de nombreuses classes d’actifs est aussi possible en cas 
de choc, d’autant que la recherche de rendement (search for yield) pousse progressivement à 
une prise de risque accrue et à une moindre rémunération des risques pris. 
Pour résumer, l’environnement macrofinancier associé à ce « low for long », ce sont des marchés 
sur lesquels les prix d’actifs sont élevés, des marchés propices à la prise de risque tout en restant 
susceptibles d’épisodes de forte volatilité et exposés à un risque correction brutale. 
Un endettement croissant des acteurs économiques 
Le deuxième effet de ces conditions monétaires très accommodantes et, plus largement, de la 
baisse des taux d’intérêt, est de soutenir la dynamique du crédit et l’endettement des ménages 
et des entreprises. 
La dynamique macroéconomique de l’endettement des ménages et des entreprises 
Les crédits aux particuliers progressent à un rythme de +6,5 % (g.a., septembre 2019) portés par 
la progression des crédits immobiliers (+6,6 %) et dans une moindre mesure, celle des crédits à 
la consommation (+6,2 %). 
Les encours de crédits aux sociétés non financières (SNF) augmentent de +6,4 % principalement 
portés par les crédits à l’investissement (+7,3 %). Cette augmentation concerne toutes les tailles 
d’entreprises : les crédits aux TPE progressent de +8,4 % (g.a., 2e trimestre 2019) tandis que les 
encours de crédit aux PME, aux ETI et aux grandes entreprises enregistrent une croissance de 
+6,2 %, +3,8 % et +6,7 % respectivement (g.a., septembre 2019). 
La dynamique du crédit est particulièrement vive en France mais les encours progressent aussi 
dans la zone euro. Les encours de crédit aux SNF et aux ménages progressent respectivement 
de 5,7 % et et 4,2 % en Allemagne et en moyenne de 3,4 % et et 3,4 % en zone euro. 
Un crédit dynamique n’est pas en tant que tel un motif d’inquiétude. L’économie a besoin de 
financements et une économie « vibrante » est aussi une économie dans laquelle le crédit, plus 
globalement, la dette et toutes les autres formes de financement (fonds propres, crédits 
commerciaux, etc.) seront dynamiques. 
6 
 
Les motifs de préoccupation 
Notre préoccupation touche plutôt à la soutenabilité de l’endettement des ménages et des 
entreprises qui serait remise en cause par un crédit durablement trop dynamique en cas de 
mauvaise surprise sur un plan macroéconomique. Elle touche aussi au développement de 
vulnérabilités plus spécifiques qui pourraient apparaître dans un contexte de « benign neglect » 
qui pousse les prêteurs à une certaine complaisance. 
Commençons par la dimension macroéconomique – de fait, l’endettement des ménages et des 
entreprises progresse plus vite que leurs revenus. 
La dette des ménages français (principalement des crédits immobiliers) représente près de 
100 % de leur revenu disponible. Les ménages français ne connaissent pas (encore ?) les 
niveaux d’endettement des ménages espagnols, britanniques ou américains juste avant la crise 
(de l’ordre de 125 %-135 % du revenu disponible) mais en 25 ans de croissance ininterrompu, le 
ratio dette/revenu des ménages est passé de 55 % au début des années 2000 à 75 % à la veille 
de la crise de 2007-2008 et a ensuite poursuivi sa croissance, dépassant la moyenne de la zone 
euro (93 %) et faisant des ménages français les plus endettés parmi les grands pays de la zone 
euro (Italie : 60 % Allemagne : 84 %, Espagne : 95 %). 
La dette des entreprises (crédits et titre) a elle aussi progressé fortement depuis la crise pour 
atteindre 200 % de leur valeur ajoutée, portée tant par le crédit que par l’endettement de marché. 
Cette augmentation s’observe pour toutes les tailles d’entreprises. Certes, les entreprises 
détiennent aussi davantage d’actifs de trésorerie mais la dette nette de ces liquidités augmente 
néanmoins plus vite que la valeur ajoutée. 
Une inquiétude sur la soutenabilité de la dynamique d’endettement globale et le 
développement de « poches » de risque 
Aussi bien dans le cas des ménages que dans celui des entreprises, le niveau actuel de la dette 
n’est pas un sujet d’alarme. En revanche, c’est un sujet d’attention : les conséquences 
macroéconomiques de l’augmentation globale de l’endettement méritent d’être examinées dans 
la mesure où une économie plus endettée est aussi une économie moins résiliente face aux 
chocs. 
Par ailleurs, au-delà du niveau, la dynamique de l’endettement justifie une vigilance très forte : 
alors que la progression de l’endettement apparaît tendanciellement plus rapide que celle des 
revenus, la soutenabilité de la dynamique ne semble pas spontanément assurée et, en l’absence 
de toute réaction des autorités, l’endettement pourrait à l’avenir atteindre des niveaux 
effectivement alarmants.

Au-delà de ces considérations d’ordre macroéconomique qui relèvent plutôt de la « quantité » de 
dette, la « qualité » de l’endettement justifie aussi une certaine attention. Or, on constate, ces 
dernières années, un assouplissement progressif des conditions d’octroi. 
Dans le cas des ménages, les montants empruntés représentent en moyenne 5,2 années de 
revenus des ménages emprunteurs contre 4,2 années en 2015. Cette hausse des montants 
empruntés a été permise par un allongement des maturités, une augmentation des taux d’effort 
(le poids des remboursements dans le revenu) et une baisse des taux d’apport : 
- alors que les maturités dépassaient rarement 20 ans au début des années 2000, c’est 
devenu une durée « normale » aujourd’hui et ce sont les prêts de moins de 15 ans qui sont 
devenus marginaux ; 
- de la même manière, si les taux d’effort étaient exceptionnellement supérieurs à 33 % au 
début des années 2000, c’est aujourd’hui 1/4 de la production de nouveaux crédits qui 
présentent un taux d’effort supérieur à 35 % ; 
- enfin, ce sont 40 % des nouveaux prêts qui sont octroyés pour des montants supérieurs 
95 % de la valeur du bien acheté. 
Dans le cas des entreprises, si l’on regarde le marché mondial des crédits syndiqués pour 
lesquels il est possible de trouver une information sur les clauses du contrat de prêt, on observe, 
sur le segment des entreprises les plus risquées (« leverage loans ») une disparition progressive 
des clauses (« convenants ») qui encadrent le comportement de l’emprunteur ou permettent une 
renégociation des termes du contrat en cas de dégradation de la situation financière de 
l’entreprise : ce sont désormais 80 % des « leverage loans » qui sont des prêts « covenant light ». 
Pour résumer, le « low for long» constitue une incitation forte à l’augmentation de l’endettement 
des ménages et des entreprises. Si les niveaux ne sont pas alarmants, cette incitation intervient 
dans un contexte où la soutenabilité de la dynamique (observée depuis 25 ans dans le cas des 
ménages et depuis une dizaine d’année dans le cas de entreprises) ne semble pas spontanément 
assurée. Par ailleurs, l’augmentation de l’endettement passe aussi par le développement de 
pratiques plus risquées qui constituent en tant que telles des sources de vulnérabilité. 
Des intermédiaires financiers sous pression 
Parallèlement, le contexte de taux d’intérêt durablement bas met sous pression les intermédiaires 
financiers, banques et organismes d’assurance. 
Les banques dans un environnement de taux bas 
8 
 
Les banques tirent une partie importante de leurs résultats de leur activité d’intermédiation et de 
l’écart de rémunération entre le coût de leur passif et les taux qu’elles servent à leurs déposants 
d’une part, et les taux des crédits qu’elles octroient. 
Dans la mesure où les taux qu’elles servent à leurs déposants seront plus rapidement contraints 
à la baisse (« zero lower bound ») que ceux des crédits qu’elles octroient, la baisse des taux 
exerce une pression à la baisse sur leur marge d’intermédiation. 
Par ailleurs, l’intermédiation bancaire recouvre aussi une transformation de maturité : la maturité 
des passifs est plus courte que celle des crédits à l’actif. Ainsi, la marge d’intermédiation dépend 
aussi de la pente de la courbe des taux : l’aplatissements récent comprime encore la marge 
d’intermédiation. 
Au total, l’environnement macrofinancier actuel met sous pression l’activité d’intermédiation des 
banques, voire, dans certains cas, peut remette en cause leur business model. 
Pour les banques françaises, ce regain de pression accentue une évolution qui était déjà 
défavorable : la marge nette d’intermédiation des banques françaises, traditionnellement faible 
était en baisse ces dernières années, en contraste avec le redressement observé ailleurs 
(Europe, États-Unis). 
Une partie de cette baisse correspond aux renégociations des crédits intervenues ces dernières 
années. À titre d’illustration, c’est pratiquement 50 % de l’encours actuel qui a été originé depuis 
début 2017. L’évolution des taux a non seulement conduit à une baisse du taux moyen de 
l’encours plus rapide que ne l’auraient impliquée l’amortissement et l’écoulement « spontané » 
des crédits mais elle a aussi donné lieu à une concurrence assez forte qui s’est traduite par une 
baisse de la marge sur la nouvelle production de crédits. Ce contexte a rendu inopérante la 
stratégie mise en en œuvre par certaines banques de compenser la baisse des taux par des 
volumes de crédit plus importants. 
Au total, cette dernière vague de renégociations a conduit à amputer la marge nette 
d’intermédiation des banques française d’environ 6 Md€ / an pour les prochaines années. À titre 
d’illustration, cette « perte » récurrente est à rapprocher d’une marge d’intermédiation totale des 
banques françaises d’environ 70 Md€ en 2018. 
Il me semble toutefois utile de nuancer le rôle des taux bas sur la rentabilité de l’intermédiation 
bancaire : la baisse des taux depuis le début de la crise a soutenu l’économie et, ce faisant, a 
contribué à la fois à soutenir la demande de crédit et à contenir le coût du risque pour les banques. 
Pour autant, ces effets particulièrement bénéfiques à la sortie de la crise s’estompent 
progressivement. Ainsi, il est peu probable (ni réaliste) que le coût du risque baisse davantage. 
9 
 
Enfin, cette pression sur la rentabilité des banques intervient aussi à un moment où d’autres 
changements structurels obligent à des investissements importants et posent aux banques des 
questions fondamentales sur leur business model et leur manière d’opérer. La transition 
numérique (« digitalisation ») représente un défi de taille pour des établissements qui 
consacrent déjà 15 % à 20 % de leur résultat (produit net bancaire) à l’entretien de leurs 
système d’information. L’effort d’investissement supplémentaire lié à la « digitalisation » est 
forcément contraint par les circonstances actuelles. 
L’impact des taux bas sur les activités d’assurance 
Les évolutions de taux d’intérêt ont également contribué à attirer l’attention sur les organismes 
d’assurance pour lesquels la baisse des taux d’intérêt a un double effet : 
- d’une part le rendement de leurs actifs baisse progressivement depuis quelques années. 
Le taux de rendement de l’actif était de 2,7 % en 2018 contre près de 4 % en 2009. La 
baisse est lente dans la mesure où les organismes ont encore à leur actif des titres, 
notamment obligataires, originés à un moment où les taux étaient plus élevés. Néanmoins, 
elle va s’accélérer (la moitié des obligations en portefeuille présentant un rendement 
supérieur à 3 % à une durée résiduelle de moins de 3 ans) et, compte tenu de l’inertie des 
portefeuilles (qui est le pendant de la lenteur de la baisse), les rendements sont 
durablement faibles même si les taux de marché venaient à remonter ; 
- par ailleurs, la baisse des taux longs intervenue cet été a conduit à une baisse des taux 
de revalorisation des engagements longs (assurance-vie, responsabilité civile, assurance 
construction, etc.). 
Ce double effet de revalorisation (tardive mais immédiate) des engagements et de baisse 
(ancienne et progressive) du rendement de l’actif oblige les assureurs à engager une réflexion 
de fond sur leur offre et leur positionnement. Au-delà des solutions de court terme (renforcer 
l’offre d’unité de compte – ce qui nécessite une attention renouvelée au devoir de conseil – ou 
développer de nouveaux produits), cela devrait probablement les conduire à se recentrer sur des 
produits et des services dont le contenu en assurance est plus marqué. 
Des effets qui se renforcent  
Enfin, il faut souligner que ces effets se renforcent mutuellement. 
Confrontés à la baisse du rendement des classes d’actifs traditionnelles, les investisseurs 
institutionnels augmentent progressivement leur allocation dans des classes d’actifs alternatives.  
En miroir de cette prise de risque des investisseurs institutionnels, on retrouve l’endettement 
croissant des agents non financiers et des valorisations particulièrement élevées pour ce type 
10 
 
d’actifs pour lesquels le maintien d’une rémunération suffisante des risques, en particulier de 
l’illiquidité, n’est plus évidente. 
Ainsi, la très forte collecte des fonds de capital investissement se traduit par de niveaux de 
capacité d’investissement inemployée (« dry powder ») particulièrement élevée et une 
concurrence forte qui se traduit par des transactions intervenant à des multiples très élevés 
(récemment de l’ordre de 10x EBITDA). 
 
3. … et invitent à mobiliser et bien articuler les politiques publiques. 
Dans ce contexte, que devons-nous faire ? 
Une réponse structurelle aux problèmes structurels 
Il s’agit d’abord de reconnaître les causes de la situation actuelle : il est souhaitable de sortir 
progressivement de cette situation de taux bas. Dans la mesure où cette situation a des causes 
structurelles, à long terme, les remèdes sont aussi structurels. Il s’agit en particulier de renforcer 
le potentiel de croissance de nos économies et de combler le déficit d’investissement (privé et 
public) dont souffre la zone euro au regard de son épargne abondante. Ceci passe notamment 
par des politiques structurelles visant à promouvoir l’innovation et la productivité. Ceci passe 
aussi par une amélioration de la qualité de la dépense publique, en l’orientant davantage vers 
des dépenses tournées vers l’avenir et l’investissement. 
À plus court terme et dans une logique conjoncturelle, les taux d’intérêt très bas et proches de 
leur borne inférieure rendent possibles et souhaitables un soutien contra-cyclique plus actif de la 
politique budgétaire, aux côtés de la politique monétaire. En l’absence d’une capacité budgétaire 
de la zone euro, ceci doit se faire au niveau des politiques nationales, mais de façon différenciée. 
Les États membres qui disposent de marges de manœuvre budgétaires devraient les employer, 
d’autant que certains d’entre eux font face à une quasi-stagnation de leur économie. Quant aux 
États membres qui sont contraints par leur niveau trop élevé d’endettement, des taux d’intérêt 
durablement plus bas peuvent leur donner la possibilité d’étaler un peu plus dans le temps le 
nécessaire ajustement de leur solde structurel primaire, tout en laissant jouer les stabilisateurs 
automatiques. 
La réponse micro et macroprudentielle 
S’agissant des conséquences immédiates de l’environnement de taux bas sur la stabilité 
financière, il faut d’abord souligner que la capacité du secteur financier à absorber des chocs a 
été considérablement renforcée depuis la crise. À titre d’illustration, le capital soutenant l’activité 
des banques a plus que doublé depuis la crise et les activités de transformation des banques 
sont mieux encadrées. 
11 
 
Néanmoins, la capacité du système à absorber des chocs reste encore insuffisante. 
D’un point de vue microprudentiel (c’est-à-dire de la stabilité individuelle des établissements), les 
superviseurs restent attentifs à ce que les banques poursuivent leur effort d’assainissement de 
leur bilan (en particulier, pour les établissements de certains États membres qui portent encore 
les séquelles de la crise, à réduire le poids des créances compromises). De manière prospective, 
ils s’attendent à ce que les institutions financières (banques comme organismes d’assurance) 
fassent preuve de prudence lorsqu’il s’agit d’apprécier par exemple le risque de crédit ou de 
contrepartie qu’elles prennent ou encore l’illiquidité des investissements qu’elles réalisent, de 
gérer les risques de taux auxquels elles sont exposées ou, d’une manière générale, d’adopter 
des modèles d’affaires (« business models ») soutenables. 
En parallèle, alors que les risques s’accroissent, il est urgent de finaliser l’effort de renforcement 
du cadre réglementaire qui a été conduit depuis 10 ans tandis que de nouveaux risques, qu’ils 
s’agissent des risques portés par la disruption numérique (« digitalisation »), comme les risques 
cyber, ou ceux liés au changement climatique, doivent être bien anticipés, mieux compris et 
effectivement pris en compte. 
D’un point de vue macroprudentiel (c’est-à-dire de la stabilité et de la résilience du système 
financier), une politique macroprudentielle plus active est nécessaire pour prévenir l’apparition de 
poches de vulnérabilités et pour contribuer, dans la mesure du possible, au renforcement de la 
résilience financière et macroéconomique. Il s’agit de faire face à des risques structurels plus 
importants comme à la montée du risque cyclique. 
C’est dans ce contexte, et pour faire face au développement possible d’une population de 
grandes entreprises très endettées, que le Haut Conseil de Stabilité financière a décidé, en 
décembre 2017, de limiter l’exposition des principales banques françaises vis-à-vis des grandes 
entreprises françaises très endettées (avec une dette représentant plus de 100 % des fonds 
propres) et consacrant une partie déjà importante (plus de 33 %) de leur résultat au service de 
leur dette. 
C’est toujours dans ce contexte, et prenant acte de la dynamique d’ensemble du crédit, qu’il a 
décidé de relever le taux du coussin contracyclique (CCyB) à 0,25 % à compter de juillet 2019 puis 
0,5 % à partie d’avril 2020 pour renforcer la capacité d’absorption de perte des banques et disposer 
de marges de manœuvre afin de pouvoir relâcher la contrainte en capital des banques en cas de 
risque de rationnement du crédit afin de renforcer la résilience du secteur bancaire et de l’économie 
face à un éventuel choc financier. 
Le Haut Conseil réfléchit actuellement à ce qu’il convient de faire en matière de crédit immobilier 
pour assurer la soutenabilité de la dynamique d’endettement des ménages, éviter le 
12 
 
développement de pratiques d’octroi plus risquées et limiter le risque d’une rentabilité insuffisante 
de ces encours au bilan des banques. 
La France n’est pas un cas à part en Europe : 
- 13 États membres de l’UE (et de l’EEE) ont aussi pris des mesures de renforcement du 
capital des banques ; 
- 22 États membres ont pris au total 62 mesures en relations avec leur marché immobilier. 
 
Conclusion : Les limites de la politique macroprudentielle et les besoins de politiques 
mieux articulées  
Si une politique macroprudentielle plus active est absolument indispensable, il convient toutefois 
de garder à l’esprit quelques limites : 
Tout d’abord, notre palette d’instruments est actuellement très centrée sur les banques. Nous 
avons réalisé certains progrès vers une extension de la politique macroprudentielle au-delà du 
secteur bancaire. Mais nous devons reconnaître qu’il nous reste du chemin à faire et que cela 
devient une question urgente, dans la mesure où le secteur non bancaire évolue en réaction à 
l’environnement macrofinancier et aux modifications du cadre de réglementation. 
De plus, notre arsenal macroprudentiel étant encore relativement nouveau et non testé, une 
incertitude demeure quant à l’ampleur quantitative des effets de nos interventions. L’expérience 
nous enseignera comment adapter et ajuster nos politiques au fil du temps, mais l’incertitude 
demeurera une caractéristique de l’élaboration de politiques en conditions réelles. 
Enfin, nous devons nous abstenir de tout excès de confiance : au fil du temps, nous élaborerons 
une palette plus complète d’instruments macroprudentiels et nous apprendrons à en faire le 
meilleur usage. Mais même si les politiques macroprudentielles peuvent certainement apporter 
une contribution importante, certaines causes ultimes des crises financières correspondent à des 
déséquilibres macroéconomiques profonds et demeureront hors de leur portée et ces politiques 
seules seraient insuffisantes pour assurer la stabilité financière. 
C’est pourquoi il est important que les différentes politiques soient conduites de manières 
coordonnées, sans confondre les objectifs de chacune ni les mandats des autorités qui les 
mettent en œuvre. 
Par exemple, dans la mesure où certains développements financiers peuvent être incités par des 
dispositions fiscales (biais fiscal en faveur de l’endettement en matière de fiscalité des 
entreprises, traitement fiscal de la détention immobilière par rapport à d’autres types de 
patrimoine), il importe, quand c’est possible, de corriger ces biais qui contribuent au 
développement d’un endettement qui peut devenir excessif. 
13 
 
C’est aussi le cas de l’articulation entre politique monétaire et stabilité financière. Reconnaissant 
que la politique monétaire a des effets secondaires sur la stabilité financière et que la politique 
macroprudentielle n’est pas omnipotente, il convient de sortir d’une vision manichéenne qui 
opposerait une approche de séparation, d’indifférence stricte de la politique monétaire et des 
préoccupations de stabilité financière et une approche qui mobiliserait la politique monétaire pour 
contenir les prix d’actifs (« lean against the wind »). 
L’opposition binaire entre le principe de séparation classique et le fait « d’aller à contre-courant » 
a d’ailleurs moins de sens lorsque la politique monétaire a elle-même plusieurs instruments à sa 
disposition. Une voie médiane, que nous pourrions qualifier de « coordonnée » ou « intégrée » 
est possible et souhaitable.

Thème de la conférence : UN NOUVEL ÉLAN POUR UNE ÉCONOMIE 
EUROPÉENNE SOUVERAINE 
(SLIDE 1 : présentation) 
 
• Le sujet « Union des Marchés de Capitaux » donne lieu à de nombreuses 
réflexions <U+F0E8> L’excellent rapport publié en septembre par « Markets for 
Europe » présente beaucoup de convergence de vues avec les positions de 
la Banque de France. Mêmes constats sur les défis que l’Europe va devoir 
affronter, même importance donnée au besoin de renforcement du rôle 
des marchés financiers et aux investissements transfrontières pour 
stimuler la croissance de l’UE.  
• Un autre point commun est de vouloir montrer que la CMU va bénéficier 
autant aux PME, particulièrement celles qui sont les plus innovantes, 
qu’aux investisseurs. C’est d’ailleurs le sous-titre du rapport « a roadmap 
to a CMU for companies and savers ». 
• C’est également l’axe suivi dans cette présentation : 1- le constat des défis 
et des besoins 2- les bénéfices pour les entreprises 3- Les avantages pour 
les épargnants. 
 
Page 2 sur 11 
<U+F034>CMU : un constat largement partagé 
• Un retard d’investissement préoccupant en Europe : - (SLIDE 2) 
o Faiblesse de l’investissement et hausse de l’épargne dans la zone 
euro depuis la crise de 2008 <U+F0F0> Forte capacité de financement de la 
ZE 
• Investissements mal ciblés ou en tous cas, pas à la hauteur des défis 
européens :  
o Retard en matière de dépenses en R&D : 1 point de PIB de moins 
qu’au Japon par an, 2,4 points de moins qu’en Corée (0,63 point de 
moins qu’aux USA) 
o Pour atteindre les ambitions européennes en matière d’énergie et 
de climat, 170 milliards d’euros d’investissements additionnels 
seraient nécessaires par an1.  
o Augmentation du coût de la dépendance : à l’horizon 2030, les 
dépenses liées au vieillissement devraient progresser de plus d’un 
point de PIB dans la zone euro2. 
• Des efforts pour soutenir l’investissement ont déjà été menés.  
o via le plan Juncker (devenu InvestEU) et son bras armé le FEIS 
(Fonds Européen pour les Investissements Stratégiques) : a réalisé 
450,6 milliards d’euros d’investissements supplémentaires au sein 
de l’UE depuis sa création en 2015. D'ici à 2022, sur la base des 
accords de financement approuvés avant fin juin 2019, le PIB de l'UE 
aura progressé de 1,8 %, et 1,7 million d'emplois auront été créés3.

• S’y ajoutent des initiatives nationales, publiques et privées 
o En France la BPI (Banque publique d’investissement) : campagne de 
levée de fonds pour investir l’épargne allemande dans les PME FR 
plutôt que vers l'Europe de l'Est ou l'Asie : Ambition de créer un 
accélérateur franco-allemand avec 5 entreprises familiales de 
chaque nationalité pour faciliter cette coopération. 
• Dans le même temps que le plan Juncker, la COM a lancé la CMU qui offre 
une réponse concrète. Le projet est ambitieux mais les réalisations sont 
jusqu’à présent très partielles.  
o D’un côté, des contraintes particulières : le poids des traditions 
nationales : peu de pays ont une culture de marché, celle-ci étant 
particulièrement faible dans les pays où il n’y a pas de retraite par 
capitalisation. Certains pays ont une préférence marquée pour 
certains produits d’épargne : dépôts (DE, ES), assurance vie (FR, RU). 
o Par ailleurs, la CMU s’inscrit dans un contexte dans lequel, en Europe, 
le rôle d’intermédiation est assuré de façon prépondérante par les 
banques. Ce rôle est essentiel et c’est pour cela que les banques ont 
été au centre des préoccupations européennes depuis la crise, avec 
la création de l’Union bancaire, qu’il faut achever, et les mesures 
permettant de préserver leur accès à la liquidité. Il est maintenant 
impératif de compléter l’intermédiation avec d’autres moyens, ce qui 
constitue l’objet principal de la CMU. (SLIDE 3)  
• Pourtant, on peut faire plus :  
o 1- Les moyens existent (il existe un fort excédent d’épargne – cf. 
SLIDE 4), les besoins d’investissement sont élevés, notamment dans 
les GIPS et les PECO => Difficultés de matching 
Page 4 sur 11 
o  2/ Le contexte est favorable : taux bas durables, nouveaux acteurs 
(nouvelle COM) + urgence d’apporter des réponses aux défis 
européens  
o 3/ L’investissement est au cœur d’un enjeu stratégique pour se 
doter d’une plus grande autonomie/souveraineté : importance de 
l’innovation dans un contexte de guerre commerciale  
Transition : Les grands objectifs de la CMU ont déjà été discutés dans les tables 
rondes de cette conférence. Ce ne sont pas des projets abstraits : la CMU 
va concrètement améliorer le rapprochement en Europe de l’épargne 
disponible et des investissements nécessaires, aider les PME à investir et 
les épargnants à mieux placer leur épargne. 
 
<U+F034>Deux illustrations concrètes des apports de la CMU 
Pour une PME (SLIDE 5) 
 
• Imaginons une PME qui a besoin de financer de nouveaux 
investissements. 
• Plus cette entreprise a une taille réduite (et si elle ne dispose pas des fonds 
propres nécessaires), plus son premier réflexe est d’aller voir sa banque.  
o Suivant où elle est localisée, le taux de refus sera plus ou moins 
élevé : quasiment nul en France ou en Autriche, mais près de 30% 
en Pologne en 2017 (source : OCDE).  
o Le taux d’intérêt appliqué sera également très différent : en sept 
2019, le spread entre le taux d’intérêt moyen d’un prêt à une 
entreprise en Allemagne et celui appliqué à une entreprise en Grèce 
Page 5 sur 11 
était de plus de 250 points de base (source BCE). Du coup, le même 
investissement est rentable dans certains pays (lorsque le coût du 
financement est plus bas que le retour sur investissement espéré) 
et pas dans d’autres (lorsque le coût du financement dépasse le 
rendement espéré).  
o La forte dépendance de l’entreprise aux conditions de crédit offertes 
par les banques nationales la rend plus vulnérable aux chocs de 
conjoncture et joue de manière pro-cyclique (l’entreprise aura plus 
de mal à se financer en phase de ralentissement de conjoncture, 
indépendamment de la qualité de son projet, ce qui en plus pénalise 
la reprise). 
• L’entreprise peut aussi chercher des aides au financement au niveau 
européen (InvestEU ou COSME4)  
 
 
 
 
• Mais, si cette entreprise est, en plus, une start-up innovante, elle n’aura 
pas forcément les moyens et la connaissance nécessaire pour construire un 
dossier de co-financement européen. Elle peut alors se tourner vers un 
recours à des instruments financiers (capital-risque5, financement 
participatif, etc). Mais cette option est très limitée aujourd’hui en UE : levée 
                                                          
4 Doté d’une enveloppe de 2,3 milliards d’euros sur la période 2014 – 2020, le programme COSME intervient surtout dans la phase 
de développement afin de renforcer la compétitivité et le développement durable des PME de l’UE.  
5 Dans le cadre de la CMU, un cadre pour encourager les investissements en capital-risque (fonds EuVECA) a été créé en 2017. 
Page 6 sur 11 
de fonds des start-ups en 2018 (en % du financement mondial) US = 53% ; 
Chine = 27% (10% en 2013) et UE, seulement 10%. Sur les 372 « licornes » 
répertoriées dans le monde à la mi-juillet 2019, on compte 182 US, 94 
Chinoises et seulement 45 UE6. 
• Afin d’ouvrir de nouvelles possibilités de trouver un financement, il y aurait 
dès lors un intérêt réel à recourir au financement transfrontière et à 
défragmenter nos marchés. Ainsi, la PME du Sud de l’Italie ou en Grèce 
pourra bénéficier d’un financement plus avantageux en allant le chercher 
ailleurs dans l’UE ; la mise en concurrence des sources de financement 
permet d’abaisser les coûts de financement.  
• Mais cette pratique est difficile aujourd’hui du fait du manque 
d’information sur le cadre juridique, le cadre fiscal et sur l’entreprise elle-
même qu’une banque étrangère rencontre. La CMU peut aider à lever ces 
obstacles :  
1/ Pour qu’une banque FR ou DE finance cette PME, il ne suffit pas que 
l’épargne existe ; encore faut-il disposer de l’information 
nécessaire/pertinente sur la PME qui est à la recherche de financement – 
l’accès aux données est un point essentiel pour faciliter l’accès des 
entreprises aux financements par les marchés. La CMU permettrait : 
o D’étendre à l’ensemble de l’Europe des systèmes de cotation des 
entreprises qui existent déjà en DE ou FR (FIBEN à la BDF) ; 
o De soutenir le Projet Anacredit : permettre aux établissements de 
crédit de disposer d'une information améliorée et normalisée sur 
                                                          
6 Source : rapport Tibi 
Page 7 sur 11 
le risque de crédit et de faciliter ainsi une affectation efficace du 
crédit, y compris transfrontalier partout en Europe ;  
o D’élargir le Legal entity identifier (LEI) : permettre aux banques de 
consolider plus facilement les informations des détenteurs de 
crédits. 
 
2/ Besoin d’un level playing field :  
o mêmes contraintes administratives et légales dans les pays de l’UE, 
permettant une même qualité d’audit 
o Un droit des faillites plus efficace, une harmonisation de ces droits 
n’étant pas envisageable à très court terme (ex. appliquer en Italie 
[GR] les meilleurs standards de droit des faillites permettrait de 
réduire le coût de la dette de 0,25 [0,5] point de pourcentage, 
source FMI, sept 2019).  
o la mise en place de garanties transfrontières permettrait de 
sécuriser davantage les investissements. Or, aujourd’hui un bien en 
France ne peut garantir un financement obtenu en Allemagne (biais 
domestique + peu de biens à mettre en collatéral).  
 
 
 
 
3/ Aménager la fiscalité des entreprises de façon à ne pas privilégier le 
financement par la dette.  
 
Page 8 sur 11 
Transition : La CMU permet également de mieux orienter l’épargne 
disponible. Ce sont notamment les petits épargnants qui vont en 
bénéficier.  
 
 
Pour un épargnant (par exemple suédois ou néerlandais) SLIDE 6  
 
• Prenons le cas d’un épargnant disposant d’une capacité d’épargne.  
• Hétérogénéité géographique : certains pays ont des taux d’épargne des 
ménages élevés : SE 20% du revenu disponible en 2019T2, DE 18,5% ; NL 
16,1%, FR 14,4%, d’autres très bas : SP : 4.8%7 Mais problèmes de 
diversification, de faible appétit pour le risque, de manque de lien avec les 
objectifs européens. La CMU peut aider à lever ces obstacles : 
• Rentabilité : Si on est un investisseur, dans le contexte de taux bas, la CMU 
permet de proposer des placements qui sont plus rémunérateurs.  
o CMU apporte transparence, information, accès facilité par 
digitalisation 
o Permet de faire sauter les barrières (id aux marchés B&S) 
• Diversification de l’épargne - Un choix plus large et plus de sens donné à 
son épargne :  
o La CMU favorise les conditions d’un marché large et liquide et offre 
ainsi davantage de choix au placement de l’épargne. Les ménages 
(investisseurs de détail) pourraient accéder à des investissements,

notamment transfrontières, accessibles, à plus faible coût et 
assortis d'une protection efficace des investisseurs. 
o L’harmonisation de la fiscalité entre pays de l’UE permettrait 
d’investir indifféremment dans tous les pays, en choisissant son 
placement pour d’autres raisons que fiscales. Aujourd’hui la fiscalité 
permet surtout d’orienter l’épargne vers certains produits (cf. 
assurance vie en France). Les règles prudentielles sont désormais 
identiques en Europe, mais les produits d’épargne ne passent pas 
les frontières du fait des réglementations fiscales différentes (ex : 
assurance-vie) et des spécificités nationales qui rendent la 
portabilité des produits très faible (ex : épargne réglementée en FR). 
o Si on est un petit épargnant, permet de donner davantage de sens 
à son épargne. Ex. label européen vert qui permettrait de flécher 
des fonds liés à la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique de 
manière plus visible.  
 
Concernant à la fois les épargnants et les entreprises innovantes :  
• Participer à l’autonomie de l’UE et à ses décisions stratégiques (enjeux de 
souveraineté technologique) :  
o Mobiliser les investisseurs UE vers des projets UE. Il est normal que 
l’épargne européenne finance des projets de développement et 
circule au niveau mondial. Cependant, depuis 2016, l’UE a remplacé 
la Chine dans le rôle de créancière des États-Unis et d’acheteuse de 
titres du Trésor américain (à hauteur de 1484 milliards de dollars en 
sept 2019).  
Page 10 sur 11 
o Les futurs champions européens dépendent aujourd’hui trop des 
fonds non européens et principalement américains. En Europe, les 
acteurs du capital-risque ayant levé des fonds de plus de 1 milliard, à 
l’image d’Index Ventures ou de Rocket Internet sont encore rares. Ils 
sont pourtant les seuls à pouvoir injecter des apports de 50 à 100 
millions d’euros dans une start-up. Il est essentiel pour le financement 
des PME européennes innovantes d’augmenter ce type de 
financement, tant à leur démarrage (early stage) que pour leur 
développement (late stage).  
 
 
<U+F034>Conclusion 
• Distinction entre :  
o les « low-hanging fruits » : les mesures d’ordre technique, à l’instar 
d’anacrédit, de la rédaction des prospectus, pour lesquelles les 
banques centrales prennent leur part,  
o et les réalisations plus complexes dans le cadre de la CMU, 
soulignées par plusieurs rapports : questions de fiscalité, 
coopération entre les ministères de la justice et harmonisation du 
droit (ex. droit de la faillite), création d’une capacité d’endettement 
commune pour financer de grands projets communs (qui pourrait 
même initier une sorte d’actif sûr européen).  
o Par ailleurs, l’émission d’un actif sûr – par exemple par la BEI – visant 
à financer les projets communs permettrait de relever les grands 
défis de long terme tout en répondant au besoin d’actifs sûrs et 
liquides à l’échelle de la zone euro.

Mesdames et Messieurs, 
C’est un grand plaisir d’être à nouveau à Tokyo avec vous, et avec mon collègue 
et ami, M. le gouverneur Kuroda. Le Forum financier international de Paris 
Europlace à Tokyo constitue désormais une tradition bien ancrée… même si le 
sujet abordé dans vos sessions est celui des « nouvelles frontières de la 
finance ». Dans mes remarques d’aujourd’hui, j’évoquerai les perspectives 
économiques en Europe et en France, avant de parler de la future architecture 
financière européenne après – et au-delà – du Brexit.   
** 
I. Les causes du ralentissement actuel en Europe et les réponses à y 
apporter 
Initialement, les causes du ralentissement européen sont extérieures à la 
zone euro : l’incertitude géopolitique est incontestablement la plus importante 
d’entre elles ; elle est surtout d’origine humaine (« man-made »), c’est donc aux 
hommes d’y remédier. Nous assistons à un ralentissement significatif du 
commerce mondial en raison de l’intensification des conflits commerciaux. 
D’après le FMI, la perte de croissance mondiale qui en résulte pourrait atteindre 
jusqu’à 0,8 % l’an prochain principalement en raison d’effets indirects, au-delà 
des droits de douane : baisse de la confiance des chefs d’entreprise et de 
l’investissement, diminution de la productivité. De même, les rebondissements 
liés au Brexit ont généré de la volatilité sur les marchés et ont pesé sur 
l’investissement des entreprises. Les effets du ralentissement sont très forts sur 
la première économie de la zone euro, l’Allemagne, qui est très exposée au 
commerce mondial. Des tendances structurelles sont également à l’œuvre. 
On observe une tendance à la baisse de la croissance de la productivité – que 
certains considèrent comme « séculaire », tirant peut-être trop rapidement une 
conclusion sur le très long terme. En outre, le vieillissement de la population 
signifie que l’offre de travail diminue et que la croissance potentielle baisse. 
Grâce à a présidence japonaise du G20, les défis posés par la démographie 
sont désormais à l’ordre du jour.  
Page 2 sur 6 
 
La politique monétaire de la BCE a joué un rôle important pour soutenir la 
reprise dans la zone euro : d’après les estimations, son impact cumulé est de 
l’ordre de 2,5 pp sur la croissance, et entre 1 pp et 1,5 pp sur l’inflation au cours 
de la période 2014-2018 i. En outre, 11 millions d’emplois ont été créés 
depuis 2013. En septembre, la BCE a introduit un nouveau paquet de mesures. 
Même si elle a suscité moins d’attention, la partie la plus innovante de ce paquet 
est le renforcement de la forward guidance sur les taux d’intérêt dépendant de 
la situation économique. Subordonnée aux évolutions de l’inflation, elle jouera 
un rôle de stabilisateur automatique grâce aux ajustements de la courbe des 
taux et des conditions financières. En d’autres termes : ce qui importe, ce n’est 
pas seulement le niveau de nos taux directeurs à court terme qui, selon les 
anticipations des marchés – raisonnables me semble-t-il –, ne sont pas loin de 
leur point bas ; c’est aussi et surtout l’horizon temporel de nos mesures de 
politique monétaire. 
Clairement, la politique monétaire sera d’autant plus efficace qu’elle n’est plus 
la seule partie à jouer (only game in town). Vous ne vous en rendez peut-être 
pas compte, mais la zone euro a plus de marges de manœuvre non monétaires 
que d’autres, bien qu’elle les sous-utilise. Elle a une dette publique (86 %) et 
un déficit public (– 0,5 %) plus faibles [que les États-Unis (104 % et – 5,7 %) 
ou le Japon (237 % et – 3,2 %) en 2018]. Cela suggère que la politique 
budgétaire devrait être pleinement mobilisée pour réagir à tout nouveau 
ralentissement. Les pays disposant d’une marge de manœuvre budgétaire 
devraient l’utiliser rapidement, d’autant plus lorsqu’ils souffrent, comme 
l’Allemagne, d’un choc asymétrique ; ceux dont la dette publique est élevée 
doivent rendre leurs finances publiques plus propices à la croissance – cette 
composante qualitative est ignorée – et laisser les stabilisateurs automatiques 
agir librement. Et l’Europe ne devrait pas hésiter à recourir éventuellement à sa 
capacité d’emprunt au niveau même de l’UE. En outre, la zone euro dispose 
d’un excédent d’épargne de plus de 300 milliards d’euros pour financer 
l’investissement. L’agenda de la croissance en Europe doit donner la priorité 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
absolue à une Union pour l’épargne et l’investissement durable en y ajoutant 
une Union bancaire plus forte ainsi qu’une Union des marchés de capitaux. 
En novembre, la BCE a ouvert un nouveau chapitre de son histoire avec la 
nomination à sa présidence de Christine Lagarde, la quatrième personne à 
occuper ce poste. C’est une bonne occasion d’engager, comme elle l’a 
annoncé, une revue stratégique. J’aimerais évoquer plus particulièrement trois 
sujets en lien avec nos objectifs. Premièrement, concernant la définition de 
notre objectif principal de stabilité des prix, nous devons clarifier en particulier 
nos différents horizons temporels ainsi que notre engagement en faveur de la 
symétrie. Surtout, nous devons mieux communiquer avec les agents 
économiques – entreprises et ménages. Cela est essentiel pour leur permettre 
de mieux ajuster leurs anticipations d’inflation.  
Deuxièmement, nous devons revisiter le deuxième pilier (monétaire) à la 
lumière des préoccupations pour la stabilité financière – qui augmentent. Les 
politiques monétaire et macroprudentielle sont habituellement guidées par un 
principe de séparationii. Mais en pratique, les outils macroprudentiels ont des 
limites, alors que nous avons considérablement développé notre boîte à outils 
monétaire au cours des dernières années. Par conséquent, il peut désormais 
être parfois pertinent de considérer que nos décisions de politique monétaire 
consistent à apporter l’orientation nécessaire pour respecter notre objectif de 
stabilité des prix tout en choisissant la combinaison d’instruments qui minimisent 
les risques pesant sur la stabilité financière Cette coordination souple est plus 
prometteuse qu’une séparation stricte.  
Enfin, comment intégrer le changement climatique à notre analyse de politique 
monétaire ? Cela affecte la stabilité des prix à long terme, ainsi que la valeur de 
notre collatéral, sans compter qu’« un niveau élevé de protection et 
d’amélioration de la qualité de l’environnement » iii fait partie de nos objectifs 
secondaires dans le traité de l’UE.  
Page 4 sur 6 
 
Concernant la stabilité financière, je souhaiterais ajouter quelques mots au sujet 
de Bâle III. L’accord conclu en décembre 2017 est la finalisation d’un effort 
réglementaire sans précédent et fructueux amorcé en 2009. Je le rappelle 
fermement : il s’agit d’un compromis équitable et raisonnable. Les États-Unis 
ont dû accepter la reconnaissance permanente des modèles internes dans 
d’autres juridictions alors que leurs banques ne les utilisent pas; et l’Europe et 
le Japon ont dû accepter une comparabilité accrue de ces modèles internes, ce 
qui a pu conduire à un relèvement de leurs exigences en fonds propres. 
Certains, à commencer par les banques elles-mêmes, contestent maintenant 
l’accord. Je voudrais prendre un engagement clair : l’accord de Bâle III est 
destiné à s’appliquer partout de manière cohérente, y compris bien entendu aux 
États-Unis. Ceux qui, où qu’ils soient, recommanderaient de ne pas transposer 
Bâle III céderaient à la tentation de l’oubli, dix ans après la Grande crise 
financière ; ils prendraient la responsabilité d’un accroissement des risques pour 
la stabilité financière, à un moment où ces risques sont déjà significatifs. Cela 
dit, soyez assurés que nous exigerons une mise en œuvre équitable et 
raisonnable en Europe, tenant compte des spécificités du secteur bancaire 
européen afin d’éviter toute conséquence indésirable en matière d’exigences 
enfonds propres.  
 
II. L’économie française résiste bien, avec une croissance de 1,3 % 
attendue cette année  
Malgré ce contexte plus sombre, l’économie française résiste bien, avec une 
croissance de 1,3 % attendue cette année, trois fois plus élevée que celle de 
l’Allemagne. Cette expansion est soutenue par une demande intérieure robuste. 
La hausse du revenu réel par habitant des ménages s’accélère nettement (de 
quelque 2 % en 2019), soit le rythme le plus rapide enregistré depuis 2007 ; elle 
est soutenue par les mesures de relance budgétaire et, dans une plus large 
mesure, par la vigueur des revenus du travail – 1 million d’emplois ont été créés 
au cours des quatre dernières années. De nombreuses réformes importantes 
Page 5 sur 6 
 
ont déjà été adoptées. Naturellement, beaucoup reste à faire pour lutter contre 
le chômage structurel, qui est encore trop élevé.   
 
III. Au-delà du Brexit, construire une nouvelle architecture financière 
européenne  
Le Brexit est, et demeure, une mauvaise nouvelle pour tout le monde, mais 
surtout pour l’économie britannique. Pour notre part, nous sommes prêts à toute 
éventualité : le secteur financier s’y est préparé. Même si un accord de retrait 
finit par être conclu, tous les aspects relatifs au commerce et aux services 
financiers resteraient à négocier en 2020. L’incertitude entourant le Brexit va 
donc se poursuivre.  
Quoi qu’il en soit, le Royaume-Uni continuera de participer aux forums 
internationaux dans lesquels la coopération sera indispensable pour relever nos 
défis communs, y compris avec le Japon. À cet égard, je voudrais souligner la 
forte convergence entre la France et le Japon sur de nombreuses questions 
internationales, et notamment la défense d’un ordre multilatéral, la fiscalité, la 
régulation numérique et la finance verte. L’excellente coopération entre nos 
présidences respectives du G7 et du G20 cette année l’a démontrée de manière 
éloquente. Je salue également chaleureusement l’accord de coopération signé 
en juin dernier entre Paris Europlace et FinCityTokyo.  
Nous devons à présent regarder au-delà du Brexit. Nous nous attendons à ce 
que l’architecture des services financiers européens, actuellement centrée 
autour de la City de Londres, adopte un modèle plus polycentrique. La place de 
Paris dispose d’atouts majeurs sur lesquels elle peut s’appuyer pour renforcer 
son rôle central dans cette architecture financière européenne post-Brexit. 
Premièrement, elle bénéficie d’un écosystème financier robuste : notre capitale 
est leader dans des activités essentielles telles que l’assurance vie et non-vie 
et la gestion d’actifs ; elle accueille quatre des huit banques d’importance 
systémique mondiale de la zone euro et deux des trois autorités européennes 
de surveillance – l’ESMA et l’ABE. Deuxièmement, Paris renforce sa position 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
de leader européen de l’innovation numérique. L’année dernière, l’ACPR a 
lancé un groupe de travail sur l’intelligence artificielle. Paris a également été un 
pionnier du développement de la finance durable. La création du Réseau des 
banques centrales et des superviseurs pour le verdissement du système 
financier (NGFS) par la Banque de France à Paris en décembre 2017 a 
représenté une avancée décisive. En deux ans, cette coalition des volontés est 
passée de huit membres fondateurs à plus de cinquante membres issus des 
cinq continents. 
** 
Permettez-moi de conclure par une citation inhabituelle pour un banquier 
central, une phrase tirée d’un film d’animation de Hayao Miyazaki : « Nul n’a le 
pouvoir de changer son destin. Mais on peut choisir entre l’attendre ou aller au 
devant de lui. » iv C’est exactement l’état d’esprit que nous devons adopter pour 
relever les défis de notre monde disruptif. Nous ne pouvons pas arrêter 
l’évolution de phénomènes comme la transformation numérique ou le 
changement climatique. Mais nous pouvons retrousser nos manches pour y 
faire face, ensemble et sur tous les continents. C’est le but d’un forum tel que 
celui d’aujourd’hui. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames, Messieurs,  
Si l’on peut reconnaitre une grande qualité aux journées organisées par 
l’ACPR, c’est le sens du timing : elles interviennent toujours au cœur de 
débats animés. C’est encore le cas aujourd’hui avec la question de 
l’assurance-vie face aux taux bas. Je veux en introduction rejoindre et résumer 
les propos de B. Delas ce matin : les assureurs français sont solides et ont 
donc la capacité de conduire la double adaptation nécessaire. Tout d'abord, 
les taux servis sur l’assurance-vie doivent baisser cette année, par rapport aux 
1,8 % en moyenne de l’an dernier. Et ensuite, les assureurs doivent, tout en 
restant très attentifs à la qualité du conseil, activement réorienter et diversifier 
leur offre aux épargnants. Si en complément – et en complément seulement – 
il est nécessaire de procéder à des ajustements réglementaires pour faciliter 
cette mutation de l’assurance vie, nous sommes prêts à les soutenir. 
J’en viens maintenant au sujet de cet après-midi dédié à l’innovation. Vous 
me permettrez à la fois de restreindre le champ et de l’élargir : limitation aux 
paiements où les innovations ont été particulièrement foisonnantes ces 
dernières années. Et élargissement au-delà du seul domaine de l’ACPR et du 
superviseur : je parlerai aussi comme banquier central, y compris de la 
monnaie digitale de banque centrale (MDBC). La révolution numérique, portée 
par de nouveaux acteurs, est riche de progrès dont nous bénéficions chaque 
jour ; mais cette révolution pose également des questions importantes sur 
l’intermédiation bancaire, voire sur notre souveraineté monétaire. Je vous 
propose aujourd’hui de regarder en face ces questionnements (I), et d’y 
répondre en rappelant les deux arc-boutants de notre stratégie : garantir la 
confiance et soutenir l’innovation (II). 
** 
I/ Les avancées et défis associés au foisonnement d’initiatives privées 
dans le domaine des paiements 
Rappelons tout d’abord les grandes tendances qui caractérisent le marché 
des paiements en Europe. La digitalisation croissante des paiements 
scripturaux – qui a pour corollaire une diminution significative de la demande 
Page 2 sur 7 
 
d’espèces dans certains pays, de la Suède à la Chine – a été favorisée par la 
montée en puissance d’acteurs non bancaires. Et il faut bien reconnaître 
qu’aujourd’hui, le « centre de gravité » des paiements se déplace vers ces 
nouveaux acteurs, notamment les BigTechs. Ce basculement constitue à la 
fois un défi pour le modèle économique des banques et un enjeu de 
souveraineté pour l’Europe, dès lors que les infrastructures, le savoir-faire et la 
technologie qui les sous-tendent, seraient pour l’essentiel détenus par des 
entreprises non européennes. 
L’émergence parallèle d’une nouvelle génération de crypto-actifs amplifie ces 
ruptures. Ainsi, aux premiers crypto-actifs spéculatifs tels que les bitcoins, – 
très volatils, sans réel sous-jacent économique et peut-être sans grande 
perspective –, a succédé une seconde génération d’actifs, fondés sur la même 
technologie blockchain prometteuse, mais assortis désormais de mécanismes 
destinés à stabiliser leur valeur, les stablecoins. Ces stablecoins, grâce aux 
effets de réseau, pourraient apporter une solution concrète en matière de 
paiements transfrontières qui sont – et c’est incontestable – encore trop chers 
et trop lents.  Mais – et c’est l’autre face de la médaille – ces projets de crypto-
actifs, qui auraient une vocation mondiale, sont également générateurs de 
risques de conformité, financiers et politiques très importants. Je pense 
notamment au blanchiment d’argent et au terrorisme qui pourraient ainsi 
trouver de nouveaux canaux de financement, ou à ceux – plus systémiques – 
qui pèsent sur la stabilité financière.  
II/ Notre réponse : Accélérer sur les solutions de paiement, et envisager 
une MDBC 
Il est bien sûr exclu, pour nous, banquiers centraux et superviseurs, de subir 
ce changement. Nous devons assumer pleinement l’exercice de notre double 
objectif – garantir la confiance / soutenir l’innovation – qui est inscrit dans 
l’ADN même de notre institution. 
Nous nous engageons d’abord à garantir la confiance – cela au niveau 
mondial – par une action forte et coordonnée. La Présidence française du G7 
Page 3 sur 7 
 
avait réagi vite et fort en juin dernier : nous avions avec Bruno Le Maire confié 
un mandat à Benoît Cœuré dès le lendemain de l’annonce du projet Libra. 
Son rapport – établi en quatre mois et publié en octobre – procède à une 
évaluation complète des risques associés aux stablecoins, à la fois sous 
l’angle micro-économique en matière de lutte anti-blanchiment et de protection 
du consommateur mais aussi macro-économique pour la stabilité financière. 
Nous préparons désormais, dans le cadre du Conseil de stabilité financière 
(FSB) d’ici l’été prochain, une réponse réglementaire coordonnée à ces 
différents enjeux. 
J’en viens maintenant au deuxième pilier de notre réponse : le soutien à 
l’innovation pour améliorer les systèmes de paiement, et répondre aux 
attentes croissantes des consommateurs. Nous devons d’abord saisir les 
opportunités offertes par la révolution digitale pour développer une véritable 
solution paneuropéenne des paiements. Comme le disait Steve Jobs, 
« innover, c’est savoir abandonner des milliers de bonnes idées ». Cette 
réflexion éclaire le défi que s’apprêtent à relever les banques européennes 
dans le cadre du projet PEPS-I [Pan European Payment Solution Initiative]. Je 
veux dire tout mon espoir dans leur capacité à fédérer – en dépassant les 
« bonnes idées » nationales – pour proposer rapidement une solution de 
paiement paneuropéenne unique et éviter ainsi la fragmentation du marché et 
la prédominance de solutions non européennes. L’Eurosystème saura 
apporter tout le soutien nécessaire le moment venu, à l’instar de ce que nous 
faisons pour promouvoir l’usage de TIPS [Target Instant Payment Settlement]. 
Infrastructure de marché capable de traiter les paiements instantanés sur une 
base paneuropéenne, TIPS pourrait assurer le règlement interbancaire des 
opérations initiées par l’intermédiaire de PEPS-I. Cette solution pan-
européenne serait une avancée majeure pour aider les banques européennes 
à relever les défis posés par les BigTechs.  
Un autre chantier de taille est devant nous : réduire le coût et accroitre la 
rapidité d’exécution des paiements transfrontaliers en identifiant des 
solutions concrètes et utiles. Il faut viser notamment l’harmonisation des 
Page 4 sur 7 
 
standards techniques utilisés pour les transferts de fonds mais aussi une 
meilleure interopérabilité entre les différents systèmes et solutions de 
paiements.  Le FSB, sous l’égide du G20, proposera d’ici l’automne prochain 
des mesures concrètes pour que les paiements transfrontières, hors d’Europe, 
soient significativement moins chers et plus rapides. 
** 
J’aborde maintenant un sujet qui est un enjeu majeur pour le futur du système 
monétaire et financier international : la création éventuelle d’une monnaie 
digitale de banque centrale (MDBC). La création d’une nouvelle forme de 
monnaie par les banques centrales dépasse les enjeux que nous venons 
d’évoquer : elle n’est pas une condition – ni préalable ni suffisante – à des 
paiements plus efficaces. Mais nous, banques centrales, devons et voulons 
saisir cette injonction à l’innovation alors que les initiatives privées – 
notamment dans les paiements entre acteurs financiers – et la technologie 
accélèrent, et que la demande publique et politique s’amplifie. D’autres pays 
ont ouvert la voie ; à nous désormais d’apporter notre pierre à l’édifice de 
façon ambitieuse et méthodique.  
Pour ce faire, l’organisation de la Banque de France sera prochainement 
modifiée. L’actuelle DSPM (Direction de la surveillance des paiements et des 
infrastructures de marché) deviendra la Direction des infrastructures, de 
l’innovation et des paiements (DIIP), élargie à toutes les innovations sur les 
paiements, les infrastructures et à la monnaie digitale de Banque centrale. 
Son expertise sera encore renforcée par des recrutements de compétences 
additionnelles, et la DIIP, appuyée sur notre Lab, travaillera avec des 
innovateurs privés de la place : nous entendons commencer des 
expérimentations rapidement et lancer un appel à projets d’ici la fin du premier 
trimestre 2020. Nous sommes particulièrement intéressés à participer à des 
expérimentations d’intégration d’une MDBC « de gros » dans des procédures 
innovantes d’échange et de règlement d’actifs financiers tokenisés. 
Nathalie Aufauvre, Directrice générale de la Stabilité financière et des 
Opérations, coordonnera l’ensemble de cette accélération de la Banque de 
Page 5 sur 7 
 
France. Notre action contribuera naturellement à celle de l’Eurosystème dont 
l’étude d’un éventuel « e-euro » » devrait être un des prochains sujets : 
Christine Lagarde l’a évoqué lundi devant le Parlement européen. Au-delà, 
nous entendons participer aux travaux menés au sein de l’« innovation hub » 
de la BRI récemment mis en place.  
Sur le fond, je souhaite partager avec vous des premières réflexions – encore 
ouvertes bien sûr – sur trois dimensions : les finalités, les externalités, et les 
modalités possibles d’une telle monnaie digitale de Banque centrale.  
1/ Je vois, à ce stade, trois finalités différentes – mais non exclusives les 
unes des autres – à la digitalisation de la monnaie de banque centrale. La 
première tient à la volonté, dans les pays comme la Suède où l’utilisation des 
espèces est en fort déclin, de garantir l’accès des citoyens à la monnaie de 
banque centrale. Disposer d’une MDBC permettrait alors de préserver la 
confiance dans le système financier qui résulte en partie de la possibilité 
d’échanger ses avoirs contre de la monnaie légale. Le deuxième argument 
porte sur les gains d’efficacité, la réduction des coûts d’intermédiation et la 
robustesse potentiellement générés par la « tokénisation » de la monnaie 
centrale notamment dans les activités de règlement et de post-marché 
(objectif également visé par le projet JPM Coin de la banque JP Morgan). 
Enfin, troisième finalité – la plus importante pour les autorités politiques, y 
compris en France et en Europe – la mise en place d’une MDBC nous 
permettrait de disposer d’un puissant levier d’affirmation de notre souveraineté 
face aux initiatives privées du type Libra. C’est d’ailleurs l’une des 
préoccupations mises en avant par la Banque centrale chinoise dans son 
projet de Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). 
Dans un tel contexte, quelle forme donner à notre MDBC ? En la matière, 
les attentes du grand public diffèrent sensiblement de celles des institutions 
financières. Deux usages différents de MDBC pourraient donc à terme se 
côtoyer, l’un destiné aux paiements entre acteurs du secteur 
financier (monnaie dite de « gros ») utilisant la blockchain et toutes ses 
possibilités, notamment la disponibilité de « smart contracts », l’autre destiné 
Page 6 sur 7 
 
au public (monnaie dite de « détail »), plus simple et mieux à même de traiter 
des opérations de masse. À cet égard, les institutions financières disposent 
d’un niveau de maturité digitale plus élevé que les particuliers puisqu’elles 
accèdent déjà à la monnaie centrale sous forme numérique grâce à leurs 
comptes à la banque centrale. Par ailleurs, dans le prolongement des 
interrogations du Gouverneur de la Banque d’Angleterre, Mark Carney, sur 
l’opportunité de créer une monnaie digitale internationale en réponse à la 
position dominante du dollar, je vois un intérêt certain à avancer rapidement 
sur l’émission au moins d’une MDBC de gros afin d’être le premier émetteur 
au niveau international et tirer ainsi les bénéfices réservés à une MDBC de 
référence.  
2/ L’émission d’une MDBC peut générer des externalités positives 
significatives en accroissant la productivité du secteur financier et au-delà de 
l’économie, et en soutenant la confiance dans la monnaie et le système 
financier. Mais parallèlement, il nous faut absolument étudier les externalités 
potentiellement négatives qu’une MDBC pourrait avoir sur la liquidité, la 
rentabilité et l’intermédiation bancaires. Les risques associés aux conversions 
importantes et/ou soudaines de dépôts bancaires vers la monnaie centrale 
devront, à ce titre, être strictement étudiés.  
3/ La troisième dimension tient aux modalités de diffusion de la MDBC, 
notamment « de détail », qui devront faire l’objet d’une vigilance particulière. 
Je pense à la question de son statut légal – qui n’est pas indispensable mais 
probable – ; aux conditions de sa détention – sous forme de comptes plutôt 
que de jetons – ; et, enfin, à la possibilité d’y accéder pour les non-résidents, 
ce qui favoriserait incontestablement son internationalisation. Par ailleurs, 
grâce à un savoir-faire éprouvé en matière d’instruments de paiement, de 
connaissance de la clientèle et de suivi des transactions, les intermédiaires 
financiers pourront jouer un rôle de vigie aux avant-postes de la distribution de 
la MDBC. Une réflexion parallèle devra nécessairement être engagée pour 
définir les possibilités d’anonymat lorsque la MDBC circule « de personne à

cela se fait déjà en France pour les paiements en monnaie électronique ou en

L’innovation aujourd’hui, sans doute plus que dans d’autres périodes de 
l’histoire, est de nature à modifier en profondeur les activités bancaires. Il ne 
s’agit plus simplement de transformer les paiements, c’est la monnaie elle-
même qui est mise en cause. La Banque de France, comme elle le fait depuis 
plus de deux cents ans, entend accompagner ces évolutions et adapter son 
propre fonctionnement à ce changement de paradigme. Mais elle le fera en 
veillant à ce que la confiance, qui est essentielle à l’innovation, soit 
doublement préservée. Confiance vis-à-vis de la monnaie d’abord : chacun 
sera libre de choisir son support, y compris encore des espèces. Confiance 
également dans la capacité des institutions financières à financer 
l’économie. Et l’ACPR poursuivra et intensifiera – avec son pôle FINTECH-
Innovation notamment –, le suivi de toutes les innovations qui ont et auront un 
impact sur ces modes de financement. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Mesdames, Messieurs, chers professeurs et chers étudiants, 
Je suis heureux de commencer cette année avec vous à Dauphine, et de vous 
présenter mes vœux les plus chaleureux. Le début d’année est souvent 
l’occasion des bonnes résolutions, mais c’est également un temps propice aux 
bilans. Parmi les surprises de 2019, il y a eu la prolongation des politiques 
monétaires très accommodantes, alors que beaucoup en attendaient – en 
espéraient ? – la normalisation. Et donc, des taux bas qui vont durer : « low for 
longer » ; un nombre croissant en redoute les conséquences pour les 
banques, les assurances, les épargnants. Que la politique monétaire soit objet 
de débat, c’est légitime ; mais qu’elle intéresse même le grand public, c’est 
nouveau. C’est pour cela que je suis devant vous ce soir, comme un des 
responsables de l’Eurosystème : pour rendre compte des causes des taux 
bas – ils ne tiennent pas qu’à la politique monétaire – avant d’évaluer leurs 
conséquences : les effets positifs restent dominants, même s’ils ont leurs 
limites aujourd’hui, je vous en parlerai aussi. 
** 
I. Les taux bas : pourquoi ?  
Il faut commencer par un aveu d’humilité. Contrairement à un préjugé 
largement répandu, les banques centrales ne sont pas les seules 
responsables de la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt. La tendance à la baisse des 
taux d’intérêt nominaux mondiaux s’inscrit dans un mouvement de près de 40 
ansii. 
 
 
Source: FRED, Banque de France, Levy-Garboua et Monnet (2016), « Les taux d'intérêt en France : une perspective historique »  
Page 2 sur 14 
 
La décennie de l’après-crise financière marque toutefois une rupture. Les taux 
nominaux ont continué de baisser et sont même devenus négatifs à court 
terme en zone euro depuis 2014, une innovation radicale partagée avec la 
Suède, la Suisse, ou le Japon depuis 2016. L’inflation s’est parallèlement 
stabilisée à un bas niveau, entrainant dans son sillage les taux d’intérêt réels. 
L’aperçu historique de l’évolution mondiale de ces taux d’intérêt réels montre 
que leur niveau actuel est au plus bas historiquement, alors que sur très 
longue période, les taux réels mondiaux de long terme se situent plutôt entre 2 
et 4 %. 
 
 
 
1.1 Des causes structurelles 
Pour comprendre l’origine de la faiblesse des taux d’intérêt réels, il faut passer 
par le concept de taux d’intérêt naturel ou « neutre » : c’est le taux d’intérêt 
réel qui équilibrerait l’épargne et l’investissement dans un environnement de 
plein emploi et de stabilité des prix. Ce taux « R* », décrit par l’économiste 
norvégien Wickselliii en 1898, est revenu à l’avant-scène récemment. En zone 
euro comme aux États-Unis, R* aurait baissé de 150 à 200 points de base au 
cours des 15 dernières années. 
Page 3 sur 14 
 
 
Seuls des changements structurels peuvent expliquer de telles variations. Les 
conséquences du ralentissement de la population active et la productivité 
globale des facteurs ont entrainé un ralentissement du taux de croissance 
tendancielle du PIB qui expliquerait environ un quart de cette baisseiv.  
 
Les trois autres quarts proviendraient d’une offre accrue d’épargne et d’une 
moindre demande d’investissement. L’excès d’épargne mondiale est 
alimenté par l’allongement de la durée de la vie, la hausse des inégalités – les 
plus âgés et les plus riches épargnent davantage – et l’accumulation des 
réserves de change dans les pays émergents. 
Page 4 sur 14 
 
 
À l’inverse, la moindre demande d’investissement s’explique notamment 
par l’essor de l’économie immatérielle qui requiert plus de capital humain que 
d’investissements physiques, et sans doute une moindre confiance dans 
l’avenir. La zone euro particulièrement connait, depuis la crise financière, à la 
fois une hausse du taux d’épargne, et une faiblesse prononcée du taux 
d’investissement. 
 
Ces évolutions que l’on voit partout et depuis longtemps ne tiennent donc pas 
à la politique monétaire ; j’en viens pour autant au rôle des banques centrales. 
1.2 Les causes conjoncturelles 
Page 5 sur 14 
 
La mission première des banques centrales, et de la Banque centrale 
européenne (BCE) en particulier, est d’assurer la stabilité des prix 
notamment en lissant conjoncturellement le cycle économique. Et pour 
cela, elles fixent à court terme les taux d’intérêt. 
La BCE a, dès 1998, donné une définition quantitative de la stabilité des prix, 
affinée en 2003 : maintenir des taux d’inflation à des niveaux inférieurs à, mais 
proches de, 2 % à moyen terme.  D’autres banques centrales, comme la Fed 
américaine ou la Banque du Japon, en 2012 et 2013 respectivement, ont 
adopté plus récemment cette cible d’inflation à 2 %. 
 
Depuis 1999, notre politique monétaire poursuit cet objectif d’inflation avec des 
résultats tangibles : l’inflation a été, à 1,7 % en moyenne, proche de sa cible. 
Source : Eurostat 
Sur la dernière décennie cependant, dans la zone euro, l’inflation est restée 
trop basse : 1,3 % en moyenne entre 2011 et 2019, et 1,3 % aujourd’hui 
[inflation « core » v à 1,3 %]. Cette faiblesse de l’inflation, que l’on retrouve 
Page 6 sur 14 
 
dans la plupart des économies avancées, relance le débat sur l’objectif de 
2 %. Certains proposent de se contenter du 1 % actuel, comme Jacques de 
Larosière, un de mes grands anciens. D’autres, à l’inverse, tel Olivier 
Blanchard, ancien chef économiste du FMI, plaident un objectif plus élevé 
jusqu’à 4 %, pour avoir plus de marge pour baisser les taux d’intérêt en bas de 
cycle. Il est tentant de simplement les renvoyer dos à dos. Mais je prends au 
sérieux ce débat sur l’objectif d’inflation, qui sera au cœur de la « revue 
stratégique » que le Conseil des gouverneurs, présidé par Christine Lagarde, 
va lancer à la fin de ce mois. Sans préjuger du résultat, j’avance devant vous 
trois qualificatifs : 
• Notre objectif d’inflation doit être symétrique : si notre cible centrale est 
perçue comme un plafond, nous avons moins de chance de l’atteindre. 
• Il doit être flexible, et nous devons dire dans quelle mesure et/ou à quel 
horizon : nous ne pouvons garantir le 2,0 %, ni tout le temps, ni tout de suite. 
• Il doit enfin être crédible, et pas seulement vis-à-vis des marchés financiers : 
nous devons plus encore communiquer avec les ménages et les entreprises ; 
ce sont eux qui in fine fixent les prix et les salaires dans l’économie. Nous 
devons les écouter, c’est-à-dire mesurer leurs propres anticipations d’inflation, 
et choisir l’indice d’inflation le plus pertinent. Et nous devons en parallèle 
mieux leur parler sur notre objectif : ils nous croient sur l’impératif d’éviter les 
deux maladies opposées que sont l’inflation trop forte, ou la déflation ; mais 
reconnaissons qu’ils sont aujourd’hui moins convaincus que les économistes 
de la nécessité de passer de 1 % à 2 % de hausse des prix. Je crois aux 
analyses et théories économiques ; mais je crois aussi qu’elles ne changent le 
réel que si elles sont perçues, acceptées, intégrées par le sens commun de 
l’opinion. C’est d’ailleurs le champ connexe des « behavorial economics » et 
des travaux du prix Nobel Robert Schillervi.  
Reste une évidence, pour respecter notre mandat confié par les Traités : face 
à une inflation trop faible liée au refroidissement de l’activité économique 
depuis la fin 2018, notre devoir est de maintenir une politique monétaire 
Page 7 sur 14 
 
accommodante en soutien à l’activité. La BCE a, ainsi, annoncé en septembre 
dernier un nouveau paquet de mesures dont la plus innovante est le 
renforcement de sa forward guidance donnant de la prévisibilité sur les taux 
courts à venir.  
Nous avons noté toutefois dans notre réunion de décembre une amorce de 
stabilisation économique qui correspond à une réduction relative des 
incertitudes commerciales. Si cette stabilisation se confirme, il devrait 
s’ensuivre une stabilisation de la politique monétaire. Pour le dire autrement, 
le point bas observé de la croissance justifie un « Low for longer » des taux, 
mais pas aujourd’hui un « Lower for longer ».   
II. Les taux bas : quels effets ? 
2.1 Des politiques efficaces pour soutenir l’inflation et l’économie 
Justifiées dans leurs causes, ces politiques monétaires accommodantes sont-
elles pour autant efficaces dans leurs effets ? Là aussi, nous devons rendre 
compte, et aussi bien globalement que pour chaque catégorie d’agent 
économique. D’un point de vue macroéconomique, les taux bas, et plus 
largement les politiques accommodantes, ont effectivement soutenu 
l’économie. Ainsi, le FMI estimevii que sans les relances monétaires conduites 
au sein des économies avancées, la croissance mondiale aurait été inférieure 
de 0,5 point de pourcentage en 2019 comme en 2020. En zone euro même, 
les effets de la politique monétaire ont fait l’objet de plusieurs estimationsviii, 
convergentes : de 2 à 2,5 points de pourcentage pour la croissance et environ 
1,5 points de pourcentage d’inflation cumulés sur quatre ans. 
 
Page 8 sur 14 
 
Ces effets sont proches pour la France même. Plus de croissance grâce aux 
taux bas, c’est aussi moins de chômage : la zone euro a créé plus de onze 
millions d’emplois entre 2013 et 2019 dont deux à trois millions reviendraient 
directement aux effets de la politique monétaire, compte tenu de sa part dans 
la croissance. 
 
Source : Eurostat 
L’effet des taux bas peut aussi être apprécié en fonction du profil financier 
des acteurs économiques. Les ménages, lorsqu’ils empruntent, sont 
gagnants grâce à des taux d’emprunt historiquement faibles, notamment en 
France. Leur patrimoine immobilier a pris de la valeur, comme les actions. Les 
ménages, y compris les plus défavorisés, sont les bénéficiaires de la reprise 
de l’emploi. En revanche, le rendement de l’épargne en produits de taux est 
naturellement moins dynamique. Il y a même parfois la crainte d’un taux 
négatif sur les dépôts, une « taxation de l’épargne ». Cela reste et devra rester 
une hypothèse intellectuelle en France. Clairement, je n’estime ni probable, ni 
souhaitable, l’application des taux négatifs aux particuliers – hors certains gros 
patrimoines – ou aux PME.  
Les entreprises en zone euro, notamment les PME et TPEix, ont bénéficié 
d’un accès facilité au crédit à taux bas  : il faut noter cependant qu’elles ont

cessé globalement d’être emprunteuses nettes, c’est-à-dire qu’elles peuvent 
autofinancer complètement leurs investissements ; cette inversion historique, 
et peut-être temporaire, est toutefois moins marquée en France. 
 
 
 
Enfin, les États sont clairement gagnants, et avec eux les contribuables, grâce 
aux économies sur la charge de leurs dettes. Ainsi, dans le cas de la France – 
qui s’endette à taux négatif jusqu’à 9 ans – la charge d’intérêt, en % du PIB, a 
été divisée par deux en vingt ans, depuis 1998, alors même que la dette a été 
multipliée par 1,6x [en % du PIB]. 
 Source : INSEE 
Page 10 sur 14 
 
Mais ce gain même suscite une interrogation : les taux bas sont-ils 
responsables de l’augmentation de l’endettement des États, comme de celle 
des acteurs privés – ménages et entreprises ? En France incontestablement, 
ils l’ont facilitée. Mais la spécificité même de la situation française interdit d’en 
faire l’explication centrale : les taux sont bas dans toute la zone euro, et 
pourtant en moyenne les dettes des ménages, des entreprises, et des États y 
reculent en % du PIB, alors qu’elles augmentent en France. 
 
 
 
Ceci justifie plutôt une vigilance plus grande dans notre pays. J’en viens ainsi 
à deux limites actuelles de la politique monétaire.   
2.2 Deux limites à traiter avec vigilance 
La stabilité financière 
La première vigilance porte sur les conséquences des taux bas sur la stabilité 
financière. Il faut d’abord souligner que la capacité du secteur financier à 
absorber les chocs a été considérablement renforcée depuis la grande crise 
de 2008-2009 : les bilans ont été assainis avec un renforcement de la 
solvabilité et de la liquidité des banques grâce à la réglementation européenne 
et internationale dite de « Bâle 3 », et à une réduction très significative du 
Page 11 sur 14 
 
poids des créances non performantes. C’est pourquoi, la transposition 
raisonnable et équitable de l’accord de Bâle III est indispensable. 
Par ailleurs, l’effet de la politique monétaire comporte des aspects positifsxi 
que les banques omettent trop souvent : des coûts de financement plus faibles 
; un coût du risque en baisse en raison de l’amélioration de la solvabilité des 
emprunteurs. Toutefois, autant la politique monétaire accommodante profite 
aux acteurs économiques, autant sa prolongation met sous pression la 
rentabilité des acteurs financiers, banques comme assurances. Le 
reconnaître ne vaut pas condamnation des taux bas : ils sont mis en œuvre 
pour le bien commun, et pas pour celui des seules banques ou assurances. 
Mais le reconnaitre vaut nécessité d’adaptation : un secteur financier solide en 
Europe constitue un atout.  
Pour les assureurs d’abord, nous soutenons cette impérieuse nécessité 
d’adaptation. Les taux bas y ont un double effet de renchérissement des 
engagements au passif – par la réduction du taux d’actualisation – et de 
baisse du rendement des placements à l’actif. Les assureurs doivent donc 
engager une réflexion de fond sur leur offre et leur positionnement. De même 
pour les banques, la première part de cette adaptation doit revenir à leurs 
propres stratégies de digitalisation et de consolidation. Mais une part nous en 
incombe : ainsi depuis septembre 2019, nous avons décidé un dispositif dit de 
« tiering », qui réduira cette année le coût des taux négatifs de près de 
4 milliards pour les banques européennes, dont environ 800 millions pour les 
établissements français. Nous menons une politique macro prudentielle pour 
inciter les banques à une gestion prudente de leurs risques. C’est le rôle du 
Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière (HCSF) qui a mis en place depuis 2018 
un « coussin contracyclique » de capital supplémentaire (CCyB), puis en 
décembre 2019, des recommandations en matière de crédit immobilier qui, si 
nécessaire, seront transformées en règles contraignantes.  
La France n’est, du reste, pas un cas à part puisque plusieurs pays européens 
ont déjà pris des mesures macroprudentielles. 
Page 12 sur 14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pour autant, ne surestimons pas l’efficacité de celles-ci. La politique 
monétaire ne peut donc à mes yeux ignorer la stabilité financière, comme le 
prétendent les puristes d’un strict « principe de séparation ». Je plaide plutôt 
pour une coordination intelligente, et ce sera un des enjeux de la prochaine 
revue stratégique. La politique monétaire doit rester accommodante mais être 
plus attentive. 
Le relais nécessaire par les politiques budgétaires et structurelles 
La deuxième limite est, à nouveau, une vérité d’humilité. Nous l’avons vu, la 
politique monétaire a fait plus que son devoir. Mais elle n’est pas – moins que 
jamais – omnipotente, et ne peut faire des miracles. La politique monétaire n’a 
pas de prise sur les changements structurels à l’origine du niveau 
exceptionnellement bas du taux d’intérêt naturel. Pour combler le déficit 
d’investissement – privé et public – dont souffre la zone euro au regard de son 
épargne abondante, des politiques structurelles de croissance doivent 
promouvoir l’innovation et la productivité. Ceci passe aussi par une utilisation 
Page 13 sur 14 
 
plus adaptée et différenciée de la politique budgétaire. La zone euro sous-
utilise ici ses marges de manœuvre : sa dette publique (84%) et son déficit (-
0,9 %) sont plus faibles que ceux des États-Unis (106 % et – 5,6 %) ou du 
Japon (238 % et – 3 % en 2019).

La politique budgétaire, notamment dans les pays européens disposant 
d’excédents, doit donc être plus activement et sélectivement mobilisée. En 
Allemagne, le débat a commencé ; les Pays-Bas ont montré l’exemple avec 
l’annonce de la création d’un fonds d’investissement pour l’avenir. Les taux 
bas, là et ailleurs, peuvent être une opportunité pour financer des dépenses si 
– et seulement si – celles-ci sont porteuses de croissance potentielle accrue : 
transition écologique, digitalisation, éducation et recherche. Nous devons pour 
cela centrer – enfin ! – notre débat budgétaire sur la qualité des dépenses et 
investissements, et non plus sur leur seule quantité. À l’échelle européenne 
elle-même, nous avons une capacité d’emprunt significative : nous 
devrions l’utiliser, dès lors que nous saurons bien choisir ces priorités, au-
delà du succès du plan Juncker, ou de InvestEU. 
** 
Je conclurai par une considération plus « philosophique » : le taux d’intérêt, 
c’est aussi le prix du temps. Ma génération a fait l’euro, et essayé de traiter la 
crise financière. La vôtre hérite d’un monde pour le moins ambivalent : 
l’explosion positive des innovations et des interdépendances, mais aussi 
Page 14 sur 14 
 
celles de la menace climatique et des inégalités, le tout avec un 
affaiblissement inquiétant partout de la gouvernance publique. Un prix du 
temps bas, c’est une menace autant qu’une opportunité : une menace si nous 
cédons à court terme à la facilité des liquidités abondantes et laissons croître 
l’instabilité financière ; une opportunité si nous utilisons collectivement les taux 
bas pour investir dans l’avenir, de la transition écologique à l’éducation. 
Comptez sur notre détermination à agir du côté monétaire. Mais le combat est 
plus large – c’est notre défi politique, collectivement, comme Européens –, et il 
est plus long : ce sera le défi de votre génération. Je souhaite à chacun 
d’entre vous d’y contribuer avec succès. Merci de votre attention.

Je vous souhaite la bienvenue pour cette heureuse tradition des vœux dits « à 
la Place ». Mais il y a ici plus que la Place : les élus, la presse, les associations 
qui travaillent nombreuses avec nous. Je veux tout d’abord vous présenter, au 
nom de la Banque de France et de l’ACPR, nos vœux les plus chaleureux pour 
l’année 2020, pour vous-mêmes, ainsi que pour l’ensemble des collaborateurs 
de vos institutions. Je pense en particulier à tous ceux qui supportent les 
difficultés des transports, ou ceux qui ont dû hélas souffrir des attaques 
inacceptables contre les agences. Au sein de cette tradition, je salue une 
nouveauté :  l’arrivée de Dominique Laboureix, comme Secrétaire général de 
l’ACPR, avec à ses côtés Patrick Montagner, Bertrand Peyret, 
Frédéric Visnovsky et désormais Emmanuelle Assouan qui sera en charge des 
questions de stabilité financière. Dans un monde aussi chahuté que le nôtre, il 
est hasardeux de formuler des vœux professionnels. Je vais pourtant en risquer 
trois pour le secteur financier au sein de notre pays : que 2020 soit une année 
de stabilisation, une année d’adaptation et une année d’inclusion.  
** 
I. Une année de stabilisation  
J’avais cité l’an dernier les trois « i » ennemis de la croissance : incertitudes, 
isolationnisme notamment américain, et impatience qui pèse partout sur les 
efforts durables des réformes. Aucun n’a disparu. Mais la croissance française 
résiste à 1,3 % en 2019 malgré un ralentissement en fin d’année et 1,1 % 
attendus par nous en 2020. Et nous pouvons pratiquement exclure en 2020 une 
récession américaine ou européenne, pourtant souvent redoutées l’an dernier.  
Cette amorce de stabilisation économique, dans nos dernières prévisions 
Eurosystème de décembre, correspond à une réduction relative des incertitudes 
commerciales. Si cette stabilisation se confirme, il devrait s’en suivre une 
stabilisation de la politique monétaire. Ce qui signifie deux choses : Il est 
[donc] raisonnable vu d’aujourd’hui, comme le font les marchés, de tabler pour 
les prochains mois sur une stabilité de nos taux courts et de nos mesures. 
L’année 2020 sera d’autant plus favorable pour mener la revue stratégique de 
Page 2 sur 6 
 
notre politique monétaire autour de Christine Lagarde, notamment sur la 
question centrale de notre objectif d’inflation.  
Stabilisation aussi de la règlementation, pour les banques et les assurances. 
Vous y tenez, comme moi, même si nous ne mettons pas toujours exactement 
les mêmes choses sous le même mot. Ni fuite en avant – il n’y aura pas de Bâle 
IV –, ni retour arrière : nous devons transposer en Europe l’accord international 
de Bâle 3 conclu en décembre 2017. 
Je veux le redire: cet accord était et reste le meilleur possible pour la France et 
pour l’Europe. Je rappelle que la disparition des modèles internes était au cœur 
des négociations. Nous nous sommes battus et avons obtenu, de haute lutte, la 
reconnaissance durable de ces modèles tout en nous engageant à améliorer 
davantage leur comparabilité. L’application de Bâle III ne nécessitera pas, pour 
aucune banque française, d’augmentation en capital dédiée. La mise en œuvre 
de cet accord n’aura pas d’impact négatif sur le financement de notre économie. 
Cette crainte traditionnellement mise en avant par l’industrie bancaire s’est 
toujours avérée infondée : bien au contraire, le crédit reste très dynamique à 
près de + 7 % par an en France.  
Mais nous sommes pleinement conscients avec Bercy des négociations qui 
restent à mener. Et la France se battra pour une transposition qui soit à la fois 
équitable et raisonnable. Équitable car il ne serait pas question de transposer 
en Europe si les États-Unis n’appliquaient pas l’accord. Raisonnable pour 
maitriser les besoins en capital requis par Bâle III. Je pense d’abord à la 
nécessité d’appliquer l’output floor au niveau consolidé des groupes bancaires. 
Il faudra également articuler intelligemment les exigences bâloises avec les 
coussins de capitaux qui sont déjà appliqués en Europe au titre du pilier 2. 
2020, ce sera aussi l’année de la revue de Solvabilité II. Nous avions marqué 
nos réserves sur le document mis en consultation par l’EIOPA. Je me réjouis 
que les discussions avec plusieurs de nos partenaires-clés soient en train de 
faire avancer nos préoccupations centrales : la revue ne doit pas conduire à 
l’augmentation des exigences en fonds propres qui pèsent sur le secteur 
Page 3 sur 6 
 
européen de l’assurance ; le calcul de la marge pour risque doit être moins 
pénalisant ; la convergence des pratiques nationales doit être accrue. Nous 
poursuivons aussi les discussions sur un meilleur traitement du financement de 
nos entreprises – la réduction du choc actions en est un des leviers –, et des 
investissements notamment pour la transition écologique. 
II. Une année d’adaptation 
J’en viens ici au sujet qui vous préoccupe le plus. Les taux bas, et plus encore 
les taux négatifs, ne sont pas une fin en soi. J’ai eu l’occasion, dans un discours 
jeudi dernier à l’Université de Paris-Dauphine, de revenir très explicitement sur 
les causes des taux bas, et sur leurs effets. Ceux-ci sont sans aucun doute 
positifs pour l’économie française dans son ensemble : plus de 2 points de 
croissance supplémentaire sur quatre ans, et de ce fait une contribution 
significative au million d’emplois nets créés en France depuis 2016. Mais autant 
la politique monétaire accommodante profite aux acteurs économiques – 
ménages, entreprises, comme États –, autant sa prolongation pèse sur la 
rentabilité des acteurs financiers, et impose donc un effort d’adaptation. Je 
tiens à rendre hommage à la qualité et la solidité de nos institutions 
financières, parmi les meilleures d’Europe et qui ont accompli ces dernières 
années un chemin considérable. La première part de cette adaptation vous 
revient naturellement, par vos stratégies de digitalisation et d’efficacité 
opérationnelle. Mais une part nous en incombe.  
Pour les banques, le mécanisme de tiering décidé en septembre dernier permet 
de réduire le coût des taux négatifs de près de 4 milliards pour les banques 
européennes, dont environ 800 millions pour les établissements français. Ces 
chiffres sont assez significatifs pour mériter d’être cités, n’hésitez pas à le faire 
aussi. Pour les assurances, deux points méritent d’être soulignés. D’une part 
la poursuite nécessaire de la baisse du rendement des produits d’assurance vie 
en euros. D’autre part les dispositions prises à la fin de l’année dernière sur la 
PPB [provision de participation aux bénéfices]. Cette provision qui appartient et 
continuera d’appartenir aux assurés pourra désormais être prise en compte 
Page 4 sur 6 
 
dans le calcul du ratio de solvabilité des assureurs. J’ai soutenu l’adoption de 
cette mesure car elle permet d’aligner la pratique française sur celle des autres 
pays concernés et notamment de l’Allemagne. Pour autant, elle ne pourra 
jamais compenser une solvabilité insuffisante.  
L’adaptation à l’environnement de taux bas passe également par une vigilance 
accrue en matière de qualité et de tarification des crédits. C’est le rôle du 
Haut Conseil de Stabilité Financière (HCSF), présidé par Bruno Le Maire : nous 
avons émis en décembre dernier une recommandation sur la durée et la charge 
de remboursement des crédits immobiliers. Elle s’applique à tous les nouveaux 
prêts déposés depuis ce mois de janvier. Cela veut dire, en clair, que des 
dérives doivent s’arrêter, et des comportements doivent changer, vite. Sinon, 
nous passerions à une surcharge en capital pour les prêts non conformes, 
même si cela ne fait pas partie de mes vœux.  J’invite également les banques 
à mieux suivre leurs pratiques en matière de tarification : les marges doivent 
être suffisantes pour couvrir les coûts et les risques associés aux crédits 
immobiliers. Ces points seront particulièrement suivis par l’ACPR en 2020, et ils 
sont – je le souligne – d’intérêt commun pour vous, comme pour nous au titre 
de la stabilité financière. 
En dernier lieu, pour relever le défi de la rentabilité, les banques et assureurs 
français doivent pouvoir – enfin ! – bénéficier d’un véritable marché unique 
financier propice aux consolidations transfrontières. Or, l’Union bancaire est 
toujours au milieu du gué : des avancées sur la résolution – deuxième pilier – 
sont au moins aussi nécessaires que celles sur la garantie des dépôts – 
troisième pilier. Par ailleurs, à la veille d’âpres discussions sur la future relation 
avec le Royaume-Uni, l’Europe devrait – plus que jamais – affirmer sa 
souveraineté financière. Ceci passe nécessairement par l’Union des marchés 
de capitaux. Je veux dire ici mon soutien aux priorités défendues par le rapport 
« Next CMU », et au Forum de Haut Niveau lancé par la nouvelle Commission. 
Si 2020 était non pas seulement l’année du Brexit, mais aussi celle d’une Union 
pour l’épargne et l’investissement durable, l’Europe aurait transformé le 
problème en opportunité.

III. Une année d’inclusion 
Nous pouvons nous réjouir de deux progrès réels en matière d’inclusion en 
2019: une cinquième année consécutive de baisse du surendettement des 
ménages, soit près de 40% sur cette période, et la mise en œuvre du 
plafonnement des frais bancaires à 25 euros par mois, pour plus de 3 millions 
de clients fragiles. Au sein de ce public, l’offre spécifique – plafonnée à 20 euros 
par mois et 200 euros par an, bénéficie à 464 000 clients à fin septembre 
dernier, soit + 32 % par rapport à fin 2017. Je veux remercier ici la profession 
bancaire qui s’est fortement mobilisée pour tenir ses engagements. Maintenant, 
il faut compléter, et il faut durer. Compléter en 2020 : que les banques détectent 
de manière encore plus efficace les clientèles fragiles ; qu’elles corrigent les 
quelques écarts qui demeurent ; qu’elles fassent mieux connaitre leurs offres 
spécifiques. Ces engagements doivent être tenus dans la durée, et seront suivis 
par l’ACPR, et par l’OIB que je préside, avec un rôle actif des associations.  
L’année 2020 sera également celle de la priorité climatique. Et vous pourrez 
compter sur la détermination de la Banque de France et de l’ACPR – dont sa 
nouvelle Commission Climat et Finance durable –, pour accompagner le 
verdissement du secteur financier. Nous conduirons dans les prochains mois 
les premiers stress-tests climatiques. L’ambition de cet exercice est double : 
mieux identifier la résilience des banques et assurances aux risques 
climatiques, et accélérer les travaux méthodologiques pour disposer 
d’évaluations de qualité. La place de Paris, les acteurs publics et privés français, 
ont ici une avance reconnue, mais que nous devons conforter face à une 
compétition active. Nous publierons les scenarios d’ici fin mars, et nous 
mènerons les tests d’ici décembre. Je précise que les résultats de cet exercice 
pionnier seront publiés agrégés et anonymes.   
** 
Un mot de conclusion sur la Banque de France. Comme vous, nous faisons face 
à une nécessité d’adaptation, des paiements à la digitalisation ou la 
cybersécurité. Notre démarche résolue d’innovation nous permet de gagner en 
performance et en agilité. 2020 est la dernière année de notre actuel plan 
Page 6 sur 6 
 
stratégique, où nous aurons en cinq ans réduit de plus de 20 % nos effectifs et 
nos dépenses courantes de plus de 10 %. Nous poursuivrons notre 
transformation avec un horizon 2024. Nous le devons aux Français ; mais nous 
vous le devons également, à vous, qui êtes les premiers acteurs du financement 
de notre économie. Bonne année à vous, à vos équipes, et à notre pays.

PARIS EUROPLACE et ConsenSys 
15 janvier 2020 
« Les stablecoins » : une bonne ou une mauvaise solution  
pour améliorer nos systèmes de paiement ?  
Discours de Denis Beau, Premier sous-gouverneur 
Discours introductif* 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
La nature et le nombre croissant de crypto-actifs qui se développent dans notre paysage 
des paiements ont suscité un débat important quant à leurs vertus et leurs risques, si la 
place de ces crypto-actifs devenait moins marginale qu’elle ne l’est actuellement dans nos 
systèmes de paiement. L’apparition de ce que l’on appelle les « stablecoins » a alimenté ce 
débat dans la mesure où ces crypto-actifs pourraient apporter aux marchés de nouveaux 
moyens de règlement et de nouveaux dispositifs de paiement, susceptibles de concurrencer 
et peut-être même, selon leurs partisans, de remplacer les dispositifs liés à la monnaie de 
banque commerciale ou la monnaie de banque centrale, actuellement au centre du 
fonctionnement de nos systèmes de paiement.  
Me plaçant du point de vue d’un banquier central et d’un superviseur conscient des 
avantages de l’innovation mais également des risques induits par l’innovation pour la 
stabilité financière et monétaire, je vais partager avec vous quelques réflexions sur ce sujet 
et mes remarques porteront sur deux points : 
- la question de savoir si les stablecoins peuvent contribuer à améliorer notre paysage 
des paiements ; 
- la manière de répondre aux défis que les stablecoins soulèvent pour la politique 
publique. 
*Je remercie Valérie Fasquelle et Christian Pfister pour leurs contributions à cette intervention. 
2 
 
1. Les stablescoins sont-ils une nouvelle solution ou un nouveau problème ? 
De mon point de vue, ils peuvent être les deux à la fois. Je m’explique.  
En raison de leurs spécificités, les stablecoins sont une nouveauté en phase avec 
certains besoins des marchés.  
Dans un contexte de digitalisation de l’économie, les dernières décennies ont montré 
comment les Fintechs, de même que les Bigtechs, ont cherché à profiter des dernières 
avancées des technologies basées sur le web, notamment la blockchain, afin de fournir de 
nouveaux services de paiement, de financement et d’investissement. Souvent elles 
cherchent à atteindre cet objectif en créant des actifs nouveaux (pièces, tokens, 
stablecoins, assortis ou non de contrats « intelligents » (smart contracts)). Nous avons tous 
en tête la première génération de crypto-actifs tels que le Bitcoin et l’Ethereum, initialement 
conçus pour être des instruments d’échange dans le monde digital mais qui présentent un 
certain nombre de limites, notamment une forte volatilité des cours et l’absence de garantie 
en matière de convertibilité et de sécurité. Une seconde génération est en train d’apparaître 
sous la forme des « stablecoins », comme par exemple le projet JP Morgan Coin, l’Utility 
Settlement Coin d’UBS ou le Libra de Facebook. Ces stablecoins ont de nombreuses 
caractéristiques en commun avec les autres crypto-actifs mais ils cherchent à stabiliser le 
cours de la « monnaie » par divers moyens. Par conséquent, les stablecoins pourraient être 
davantage à même de contribuer au renforcement des dispositifs de paiement globaux, 
avec éventuellement une portée mondiale, en particulier les stablecoins parrainés par de 
grandes entreprises technologiques ou financières.  
Sur le marché des paiements de détail, les solutions fondées sur les stablecoins 
cherchent à satisfaire des préférences des consommateurs qui évoluent en faveur de 
paiements instantanés, continus et normalisés, car les consommateurs deviennent toujours 
plus mobiles. Même si cette demande est déjà satisfaite en grande partie au travers d’une 
offre de plus en plus diversifiée et digitalisée proposée par de nombreux fournisseurs de 
services de paiement – qu’ils s’agissent de nouveaux entrants ou d’acteurs établis – les 
stablescoins pourraient défier ces derniers en offrant des paiements anonymes et entre 
pairs (peer-to-peer) moins chers, plus faciles et instantanés. De plus, au niveau mondial, 
nous sommes loin de disposer d’un réseau (ou d’un ensemble de réseaux interconnectés) 
qui pourraient assurer des transferts de fonds rapides et bon marché. L’offre actuelle de 
moyens de paiement électroniques ne dispose pas d’une solution transfrontière universelle 
et ergonomique similaire aux paiements en espèces de personne à personne. Les 
stablecoins pourraient être considérés comme un moyen de paiement « universel » facilitant 
3 
 
les paiements transfrontières dans une unité de compte unique. Il s’agit, comme nous le 
savons, d’un argument avancé par certains promoteurs mondiaux de stablecoins.  
En outre, les stablecoins pourraient permettre de remédier à d’autres lacunes 
affectant l’écosystème des paiements existant, même si les enjeux pourraient 
concrètement varier entre les pays développés et ceux en développement. En particulier, 
leur technologie fondée sur la blockchain pourrait contribuer à améliorer les mécanismes de 
compensation-règlement de gros et faciliter les processus de livraison contre paiement ainsi 
que les règlements en devises croisées, tout en assurant la résilience et le rétablissement 
après des incidents opérationnels. 
Toutefois, les stablecoins peuvent également faire courir des risques significatifs aux 
systèmes de paiement. 
Comme l’ont souligné de nombreux banquiers centraux, les stablecoins ne présentent 
pas toutes les qualités attendues d’un actif de règlement destiné à être utilisé de 
manière interchangeable avec la monnaie de banque commerciale et la monnaie de banque 
centrale. En tant qu’intermédiaires dans les échanges, les stablecoins sont bien moins 
efficaces qu’un actif de règlement ayant cours légal dans la mesure où (i) ils ne sont pas 
totalement stables car la stabilité de leur cours dépend de la valeur d’un panier d’actifs, et 
(ii) ils n’offrent pas de garantie de remboursement en cas de fraude. Le fait qu’ils n’aient pas 
de valeur intrinsèque et qu’ils n’offrent pas la garantie de pouvoir être convertis au pair et à 
la demande, en monnaie de banque commerciale ou de banque centrale, signifie qu’ils ne 
peuvent pas être utilisés pour créer des réserves de valeur fiables. 
De plus, comme indiqué dans le rapport du G7 sur les stablecoins publié l’année dernière, 
les dispositifs de stablecoins sont fortement exposés à des risques de nature diverse, 
notamment des risques juridiques, financiers, opérationnels et de conformité s’agissant du 
blanchiment des capitaux et du financement du terrorisme, du droit de la concurrence et de 
la protection des consommateurs et des investisseurs.  
Il convient de s’attaquer sérieusement aux risques identifiés pour que les stablecoins 
ne deviennent pas les « maillons faibles » menaçant d’ébranler la sécurité de nos 
systèmes de paiement. Cela est d’autant plus important que certains de ces risques 
seraient amplifiés et que de nouveaux risques pourraient apparaître si les stablecoins sont 
adoptés au niveau mondial. Les stablecoins dont la taille et la portée sont potentiellement 
importantes – ce que l’on appelle les stablecoins mondiaux – pourraient en effet soulever 
des défis supplémentaires d’importance systémique, à la fois au niveau national et 
international, pour la transmission de la politique monétaire et pour la stabilité financière. Ils 
4 
 
pourraient également avoir des implications pour le système monétaire international plus 
généralement, notamment la substitution de devises, et pourraient par conséquent 
représenter un défi pour la souveraineté monétaire. 
 
2. Quel rôle pour les autorités réglementaires et de surveillance ? 
 
Dans ce contexte, il est avant tout de la responsabilité du secteur privé de concevoir 
des dispositifs de stablecoins ne faisant pas peser de risques excessifs sur nos 
systèmes de paiement. À cet effet, les autorités réglementaires et de surveillance ont 
un rôle important à jouer pour garantir que les exigences à satisfaire en matière de 
gestion des risques sont claires, exhaustives et respectées, tout en préservant le 
potentiel d’innovation technologique offert par les crypto-actifs. Pour cela, ces 
autorités doivent, à mon avis, se concentrer sur trois missions principales : 
 
- Premièrement, travailler à une réponse réglementaire qui préserve le potentiel 
positif que les stablecoins pourraient apporter à l’efficience de nos systèmes de paiement. 
Compte tenu du rythme rapide des innovations, qui caractérise également les initiatives en 
matière de stablecoins, cela plaide pour une réponse réglementaire agile, pragmatique 
et proportionnée plutôt que pour le développement d’un cadre ad hoc, unique et exhaustif. 
Cette solution serait plus simple, plus rapide à mettre en œuvre et à ajuster et serait plus 
susceptible d’assurer une égalité de traitement. Dans le contexte européen, cela constitue 
un encouragement à s’appuyer sur, et à adapter la couverture fonctionnelle des cadres 
réglementaires existants, en étendant dans certains cas leur couverture géographique. Je 
pense en particulier au cadre pour les fournisseurs de services pour les crypto-actifs 
créé en France par la loi Pacte, et au cadre européen pour les émetteurs de monnaie 
électronique, les fonds d’investissement et les infrastructures des marchés 
financiers. Cela nécessite également de garantir un traitement réglementaire cohérent pour 
des risques similaires, quel que soit le cadre ou la combinaison de cadres dans lesquels les 
entités gestionnaires des dispositifs de stablecoins pourraient opérer.  
- Deuxièmement, coordonner l’adaptation des cadres réglementaires au niveau 
international 
Quel que soit le choix final de l’Union européenne en matière de stratégie de réglementation, 
un tel effort d’adaptation du cadre réglementaire doit s’insérer dans un cadre plus 
large au niveau mondial, compte tenu du développement possible de stablecoins 
5 
 
mondiaux. Une cohérence d’ensemble est en effet nécessaire pour éviter l’arbitrage 
réglementaire selon le principe « mêmes activités, mêmes risques, mêmes règles ». 
Il est également nécessaire de traiter les risques qui n’entrent pas dans le champ des 
cadres existants, notamment les risques pour une concurrence loyale et pour la 
transmission de la politique monétaire. De fait, en juillet 2019, les ministres des Finances 
et gouverneurs de banques centrales du G7 ont convenu que les éventuelles initiatives en 
matière de stablecoins devaient respecter les normes réglementaires les plus élevées, être 
soumises à une supervision et une surveillance prudentes et que les éventuelles 
divergences réglementaires devaient être évaluées et traitées en priorité. Par conséquent, 
le Conseil de stabilité financière travaille actuellement sur une approche réglementaire et 
prudentielle globale destinée aux stablecoins. Développer une politique publique, des 
objectifs réglementaires et prudentiels et des principes partagés pourrait permettre de 
couvrir des activités qui ne se situent pas dans les limites réglementaires habituelles. Cela 
devrait également contribuer à éviter des différences au niveau national susceptibles 
d’entraîner une fragmentation et un arbitrage réglementaire qui seraient contreproductifs 
pour le développement de ces nouveaux instruments eux-mêmes. Ces objectifs et ces 
principes doivent inclure des exigences communes vis-à-vis des opérateurs du marché 
mondial des stablecoins (GSC operators) avant le début de leurs opérations, comme par 
exemple une exigence de clarté des politiques et des moyens de gestion des risques 
s’agissant de leurs mécanismes de stabilisation, des liens et les expositions entre leurs 
composantes essentielles et les autres entités du système financier, et une exigence de 
certitude juridique en ce qui concerne les droits de remboursement des usagers et les 
créances potentielles sur les avoirs de réserve sous-jacents. De plus, il est nécessaire de 
s’accorder sur des principes et des dispositifs de surveillance transfrontières adéquats entre 
autorités responsables des juridictions impactées par la possible circulation de stablecoins. 
À cet effet, nous devons nous inspirer des normes et des principes existants pour la 
coopération transfrontière dans le domaine des infrastructures de marché ou de la lutte 
contre le blanchiment de capitaux et le financement du terrorisme, et les réexaminer.  
- Troisièmement, conduire des efforts concrets – notamment des expérimentations 
réelles – pour remédier aux faiblesses du paysage actuel des paiements et des 
règlements.  
L’adaptation des cadres réglementaires et de surveillance pourrait s’avérer insuffisante car 
nous devons nous assurer que les stablecoins ne deviennent pas une mauvaise 
solution à un problème réel. L’ordre actuel de notre système financier repose sur des 
émetteurs multiples d’actifs de règlement liés à l’actif de règlement de référence 
6 
 
fourni par les banques centrales. Afin de préserver les incitations et les avantages en 
faveur de l’innovation, de l’efficience et de la stabilité, les banques centrales, en tant 
qu’émettrices de l’actif de règlement de référence doivent réexaminer, et 
éventuellement adapter les conditions dans lesquelles elles mettent à disposition cet 
actif de règlement. Dans cette perspective, une possibilité consisterait pour les banques 
centrales à émettre leur monnaie sous forme digitale, ce que l’on appelle la monnaie digitale 
de banque centrale (MDBC). Cela pourrait être particulièrement approprié pour répondre 
aux besoins de règlement en monnaie de banque centrale entre les intermédiaires 
financiers. De fait, nous observons un foisonnement d’initiatives visant à une 
« tokenisation » des actifs financiers parmi les acteurs financiers, ce qui crée le risque que 
ces évolutions aboutissent à des approches désordonnées et à des adaptations 
hétérogènes des processus de paiement, qui sont actuellement principalement traités par 
le biais des infrastructures de marché. Par conséquent, l’Eurosystème, en tant que 
fournisseur majeur de services essentiels de compensation-règlement de gros en euros, 
doit être disposé à expérimenter les conditions dans lesquelles il met à disposition la 
monnaie de banque centrale en tant qu’actif de règlement. À cet effet, nous avons à la 
Banque de France commencé à nous familiariser avec des solutions innovantes, 
notamment la DLT. L’expérimentation est fondamentale dans ce domaine et c’est pourquoi, 
comme l’a déjà annoncé le Gouverneur Villeroy de Galhau, la Banque de France lancera 
un appel à projets avant la fin du premier trimestre 2020. En effet, nous souhaitons travailler 
avec les innovateurs de la place et commencer des expérimentations rapidement afin 
d’intégrer éventuellement une MDBC de « gros » dans des procédures innovantes 
d’échange et de règlement d’actifs financiers tokenisés.  
Les banques centrales pourraient également contribuer à remédier à l’une des lacunes 
majeures des systèmes de paiement actuels, à savoir les paiements de détail 
transfrontières. Il s’agit de l’un des moteurs du développement des crypto-actifs tels que 
les stablecoins, et nous pensons que nous pourrions aider à identifier et à soutenir d’autres 
solutions concrètes, utiles et éventuellement complémentaires. 
 
En conclusion, il est difficile d’anticiper le rôle que les stablecoins, et plus généralement les 
crypto-actifs pourraient jouer dans le système de paiement du futur, notamment dans la 
mesure où les caractéristiques de ces actifs devraient changer considérablement. Même s’il 
est clair que les stablecoins offrent des opportunités pour améliorer nos systèmes de 
paiement, ils peuvent également comporter des risques relativement importants. S’ils ne 
sont pas traités, ces risques pourraient introduire de nouvelles sources de fragmentation, 
7 
 
d’instabilité et de fraude et pourraient soulever des questions plus fondamentales de 
souveraineté monétaire. Dans ce contexte, il est avant tout de la responsabilité des entités 
du secteur privé de concevoir des dispositifs ne faisant pas peser de risques excessifs sur 
nos systèmes de paiement. Mais les autorités réglementaires et de surveillance ont 
également un rôle important à jouer pour garantir que les exigences à satisfaire en matière 
de gestion des risques sont claires, exhaustives, cohérentes d’un pays à l’autre et 
respectées, tout en préservant le potentiel d’innovation technologique offert par les 
crypto-actifs. En plus de contribuer à l’adaptation des cadres réglementaires et de 
surveillance pour traiter ces risques, les banques centrales peuvent apporter une 
contribution supplémentaire, notamment en réexaminant et en adaptant éventuellement les 
conditions dans lesquelles elles mettent à disposition la monnaie de banque centrale à des 
fins de règlement. Pour cela, nous devons garder un esprit d’ouverture et développer une 
compréhension approfondie des innovations qui se diffusent actuellement au sein du 
secteur financier, notamment grâce à des expérimentations. Cela est essentiel pour notre 
capacité à contribuer à fournir un cadre réglementaire sain, adapté et actualisé favorisant 
l’innovation et permettant d’atténuer de manière appropriée les risques inhérents à celle-ci. 
Cela est également fondamental pour notre capacité à adapter nos performances dans les 
différents rôles que nous jouons pour remplir notre mandat de stabilité financière et conduire 
des politiques monétaires efficientes. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de François Villeroy de Galhau, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France, 
30 ans de prévention et de traitement du surendettement : le modèle français 
 Paris, 6 février 2020 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contact presse : Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr), Déborah Guedj 
(deborah.guedj@banque-france.fr) 
Page 1 sur 4 
 
Je vais ouvrir cet après-midi qui nous permet de mesurer le chemin parcouru 
depuis 30 ans, et je suis heureux de saluer la présence de Véronique Neiertz. 
Incontestablement, nous disposons en France d’une procédure efficace de 
prévention et de traitement du surendettement. Une procédure pragmatique 
qui a su évoluer au fil des années pour apporter une solution concrète à des 
millions de Français en situation d’impasse financière. Voilà un exemple de 
réforme réussie en France, dans la ténacité de la durée et les efforts combinés 
de majorités politiques différentes. Ces succès – dont nous pouvons 
collectivement nous féliciter – n’appellent pour autant aucune complaisance 
mais bien plutôt une mobilisation poursuivie sous la forme d’une double 
injonction : accompagner et prévenir. 
** 
I. Accompagner 
L’année 2020 verra la réalisation de quatre progrès concrets en faveur de 
l’accompagnement des personnes surendettées.  
1. Une proximité renforcée grâce au déploiement des Points conseil budget 
(PCB) sur tout le territoire, pour atteindre les 400 structures d’ici la fin de 
cette année. Nous les accompagnerons, et formerons leurs équipes. 
2. Une procédure plus accessible puisque chaque personne qui le souhaite 
pourra saisir son dossier de surendettement en ligne directement sur le 
portail « particuliers » du site de la Banque de France. C'est une faculté 
que nous créons mais en rien une obligation, le formulaire papier restera 
toujours disponible. Je rappelle d’ailleurs que la Banque de France a fait le 
choix de maintenir au moins une succursale dans chaque département 
et donc au total 185 lieux d’accueil physiques [105 succursales et 
80 agences de proximité : 75 BAI et 5 antennes de proximité] grâce à une 
organisation plus efficace et concentrée du traitement des dossiers. Nous 
avons également développé une relation multicanale avec nos usagers – 
courriers, téléphone, courriels –, qui nous a permis de répondre à plus 
d’1,2 millions de demandes rien qu’en 2019. 
Page 2 sur 4 
 
3. Des frais bancaires plafonnés y compris pour les personnes 
surendettées, et ce pendant toute la durée de leurs plans. Plus de 
3 millions de personnes fragiles bénéficient déjà du plafonnement de leurs 
frais bancaires à 25€ par mois. Ces conditions doivent aussi profiter aux 
familles surendettées dès l'acceptation de leur dossier. Elles doivent même 
pouvoir, si elles le veulent, être éligibles à l'offre spécifique qui permet de 
ramener ce plafond à 20€ par mois et 200€ par an. Nous veillerons, avec 
l’ACPR et l’OIB que je préside, à ce que les frais bancaires n’aggravent pas 
la situation de personnes déjà fragilisées.  
4. Des courriers plus clairs et compréhensibles par tous : trop de 
personnes surendettées ne comprennent pas les termes – parfois 
complexes – de nos courriers. Nous nous engageons donc à les simplifier. 
À cette occasion, nous veillerons également à expliciter davantage les 
démarches qui restent à accomplir pour activer les plans décidés par les 
commissions de surendettement. 
Enfin, je rappelle que nous apportons une solution concrète aux travailleurs 
indépendants et micro-entrepreneurs qui ont cessé leur activité mais qui 
comptent encore, dans leur endettement, des dettes professionnelles de 
sécurité sociale. En accord avec les ministères concernés, consigne a été 
donnée aux commissions de prendre en charge ces situations : 1650 d’entre 
eux ont ainsi pu résoudre leurs problèmes dès 2019.  
 
II. Prévenir 
J’en viens maintenant au second pilier de notre stratégie pour lutter contre le 
surendettement : la prévention.  
Cela passe d’abord par un crédit mieux maitrisé. C’est l’ambition poursuivie 
par le HCSF présidé par Bruno Le Maire. Dans un contexte de croissance 
rapide du crédit immobilier, nous observons une certaine dérive des conditions 
d’octroi. Nous avons donc, en décembre dernier, recommandé aux banques 
de respecter des règles de bon sens : de manière générale, il faut éviter les 
crédits immobiliers à plus de 25 ans, et les taux d’effort supérieurs à 
33 %.  
Page 3 sur 4 
 
Il ne s’agit pas, je le redis, d’exclure les ménages du crédit immobilier. Il 
s’agit plutôt de les protéger en respectant les fondamentaux d’un modèle 
français de crédit immobilier qui a fait ses preuves : un crédit à taux fixe, des 
mensualités raisonnables, en rapport avec les revenus. L’accès au crédit sera 
maintenu, d’une part en utilisant une partie de l’épargne aisément disponible 
(par exemple, l’assurance-vie) pour réduire le taux d’effort des ménages, 
d’autre part grâce aux flexibilités que nous avons prévues. La production 
d'une banque en matière de crédits immobiliers pourra, jusque dans la limite 
de 15 % – ce qui est significatif – aller au-delà de ces deux règles. Et au sein 
de ces 15%, nous avons demandé que les trois quarts soient réservés aux 
primo-accédants et de façon générale à tous ceux qui acquièrent leurs 
résidences principales. 
Ce dispositif n'est donc pas un frein, c'est un assainissement, gagnant pour 
les ménages mais aussi pour la stabilité de notre système financier. La 
croissance du crédit immobilier continuera, mais à un rythme et selon des 
modalités plus soutenables. Si nous ne rappelions pas aujourd'hui ces règles 
de bon sens, la dérive de ces derniers trimestres risquerait de s’accélérer ; 
nous aurions alors demain, pour certains ménages, un vrai risque de 
surendettement, particulièrement en cas de retournement du cycle 
économique et de montée du chômage. N'attendons pas collectivement de 
voir surgir le problème ou une crise financière : il serait trop tard pour agir. 
 
Je terminerai sur la nécessité d’informer et de former. En tant qu’opérateur 
national d’éducation économique, financière et budgétaire, la Banque de 
France a formé près de 30 000 intervenants sociaux entre 2018 et 2019. Cette 
ambition de formation vaut également pour l’ensemble de nos concitoyens. 
Pour mémoire, 46 % des personnes que nous avons interrogées en 2019 ne 
savaient pas ce qu’était un crédit renouvelable. C’est pour eux, notamment, 
que nous avons mis en ligne et enrichi le portail mesquestionsdargent.fr, afin 
d’apporter, en toute indépendance, des réponses à leurs interrogations du 
quotidien. Informer, c’est également pour nous l’occasion de dialoguer pour 
Page 4 sur 4 
 
mieux tenir compte des réalités du terrain. Et je veux ici saluer le rôle du 
« Club Créanciers », qui réunit trois fois par an les principaux établissements 
de la Place. Ces échanges sont essentiels, et favorisent incontestablement 
l’efficacité de notre procédure.  
** 
Accompagner et prévenir : deux piliers qui sont au socle de notre engagement 
résolu en matière de lutte contre le surendettement. Je rends fortement 
hommage à toutes nos équipes qui se mobilisent au quotidien au service de 
nos concitoyens les plus fragiles. Mais seul, cet engagement n’est rien. Il nous 
faut également – et collectivement – agir contre le chômage structurel, terreau 
du surendettement. Nous pouvons collectivement nous féliciter d’une bonne 
nouvelle : depuis quatre ans, depuis 2016, notre pays a créé un million 
d’emplois net supplémentaires – grâce aussi aux réformes successives pour 
l’emploi, dont le CICE et sa transformation en baisse de charges. Le chômage 
a diminué en conséquence, mais il reste encore trop élevé dans notre pays, 
supérieur à 8 %.  La solution passe prioritairement par une autre réforme, celle 
de la formation professionnelle et de l’apprentissage. De ce point de vue, je 
me réjouis que les regards changent – enfin ! – sur l’apprentissage, et que 
plus de jeunes aujourd’hui [+16 % en 2019] optent pour cette forme 
d’enseignement. Nous ne sommes pas encore au bout du chemin, mais, 
assurément, la voie empruntée est la bonne. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention.

Quelle souveraineté financière dans un monde numérique ? 
Keynote de clôture de la matinée 
Denis Beau, Premier sous-gouverneur 
 
Nous vivons désormais dans un monde de plus en plus digital, dans lequel le progrès technique 
permet la commercialisation de nouveaux biens et services qui prétendent simplifier mais aussi 
enrichir nos modes de vie. Dans le domaine de la finance comme ailleurs, l’innovation semble ainsi 
avoir poursuivi un processus historique visant à la rendre pratiquement invisible : « Au terme de son 
évolution, la machine se dissimule » (St Exupéry, Terre des hommes). Derrière cette apparente 
simplification se cache cependant une mutation profonde des activités financières, de leur 
écosystème et de leur intégration internationale. Cette mutation soulève de nombreux défis pour 
notre souveraineté nationale et européenne, c’est-à-dire fondamentalement notre capacité à 
préserver et imposer nos choix collectifs en matière de stabilité, d’efficacité et d’équité du système 
financier.  
Comme banquier central et superviseur, je sers une institution qui a été chargée par le législateur 
de contribuer à faire respecter ces choix, en veillant à la stabilité du système financier et plus 
particulièrement dans le domaine des systèmes et moyens de paiement, qui est l’objet de cette 
conférence, à leur sécurité et à leur bon fonctionnement. Je ne peux donc rester indifférent à la 
montée de ces défis pour notre souveraineté. Je voudrais donc partager avec vous maintenant 
quelques réflexions sur le contenu de ces défis et la contribution que peuvent apporter les banques 
centrales pour bien les relever.

1. La numérisation de l’économie et ses enjeux de souveraineté 
 
A- La numérisation de l’économie a conduit à une mutation profonde des écosystèmes 
financiers. Le développement d’une économie de réseau fondée sur Internet a ainsi offert aux 
entreprises un accès plus direct au consommateur, tout en réduisant les coûts fixes de lancement et 
d’exploitation de services. Cette mutation est allée de pair avec une évolution des modes de vie et 
des attentes accrues en termes de simplicité, de disponibilité, d’instantanéité, voire de 
personnalisation du service. C’est ce que l’on appelle couramment l’« expérience client ». 
L’émergence de banques digitales, où l’interaction avec le client se réalise principalement via une 
application mobile, est un exemple de réponse à cette nouvelle norme dans les usages. 
 
L’évolution des usages a par ailleurs incité certaines entreprises à s’intercaler entre les clients et les 
fournisseurs traditionnels de services sur des segments très précis, afin de proposer des services à 
valeur ajoutée. Ces processus de « ré-intermédiation » ont donné lieu en Europe à une adaptation 
continue de la règlementation afin d’encadrer et de sécuriser le partage de données, qui est la force 
motrice de l’open banking. Cette tendance profite aussi bien à des acteurs de taille relativement 
modeste (les fintechs), qu’aux géants technologiques dont le modèle économique repose sur une 
monétisation de la donnée (les Gafams et BATX dont l’entrée sur le marché européen est plus 
récente). 
 
Ces mutations sont la conséquence naturelle d’un processus d’itération créative, et promettent de 
simplifier les usages en les diversifiant. Elles n’en emportent pas moins des conséquences 
significatives dans la structure des marchés, qui ont des implications substantielles sur notre 
capacité à imposer et contrôler nos choix de politique publique concernant les services 
financiers, en particulier en matière de sécurité juridique, technologique et opérationnelle.  
Ainsi,  
- Quel est le droit applicable, dès lors que la prestation de services peut faire intervenir des 
acteurs établis dans des juridictions différentes, aux dispositions légales parfois 
contradictoires ? Les États-Unis en particulier se sont distingués par une conception étendue 
de l’extraterritorialité. Au-delà de l’identification du cadre légal se pose également la question 
de la capacité d’une autorité judiciaire à faire appliquer la loi, du fait de la taille des groupes 
financiers, de la multiplicité des intermédiaires, et de la localisation de leurs diverses activités. 
3 
 
-  La digitalisation des services financiers introduit également une nouvelle forme de 
dépendance aux points d’entrée physiques (téléphones mobiles et objets connectés) mais 
aussi numériques (moteurs de recherche, applications mobiles) et aux entreprises 
technologiques extra-européennes qui les maitrisent et les dominent. Or le droit de la 
concurrence, créé au XIXe siècle dans une phase d’affirmation de l’État face aux monopoles, 
s’avère mal armé face à ces entreprises technologiques. 
- Enfin, la dématérialisation des activités, en multipliant les interconnexions et les points 
d’entrée des systèmes, les rend plus vulnérables à de potentielles « cyber-attaques » et à 
une utilisation à des fins de blanchiment et de financement du terrorisme, et les rend plus 
dépendants, pour y parer, d’acteurs extra-européens qui opèrent en outre en dehors des 
secteurs financiers régulés. 
 
B- Dans le domaine des paiements, la digitalisation est susceptible d’avoir des impacts 
additionnels, également vecteurs importants d’enjeux de souveraineté. Je voudrais ici en 
souligner deux qui paraissent mériter une attention particulière : 
<U+F0B7> Le premier est le développement de nouveaux types d’actifs de règlement. Le 
fonctionnement de nos systèmes de paiement repose pour l’instant massivement sur 
l’utilisation largement complémentaire de deux types d’actifs de règlement 
échangeables à tout moment au pair : la monnaie de banque centrale, l’actif de 
règlement ayant seul cours légal, dominant pour le règlement des transactions entre 
intermédiaires financiers, et la monnaie de banque commerciale, très largement privilégiée 
pour le règlement des transactions de détail. Certains projets de crypto-actifs ont l’ambition 
de concurrencer – plutôt que de compléter – ce système en proposant des actifs de 
règlements alternatifs, des « coins » dont la valeur est sans lien obligatoire et fixe avec les 
monnaies de banque centrale et de banque commerciale. La mise en pratique de ces 
projets a montré qu’il n’est pas simple de créer les conditions de la confiance dans ces 
actifs de règlement alternatifs et leur utilisation demeure à ce jour marginale. Toutefois, si 
leur utilisation devait significativement prospérer, leur empreinte sur l’économie mondiale 
pourrait constituer un défi majeur pour notre ordre monétaire actuel avec des enjeux de 
stabilité et de souveraineté forts. 
 
<U+F0B7> Le second impact qui mérite une attention particulière concerne le traitement et la 
conservation des données de paiement. De la localisation des serveurs dépend en effet le 
droit applicable, mais aussi la capacité des acteurs privés et publics à s’assurer de la bonne 
gestion de leurs données. Or, une part croissante des services de conservation de données 
4 
 
est externalisée auprès de fournisseurs de cloud, majoritairement étrangers. De plus, le 
recours à des services de cloud public, dans le cadre desquels les données de plusieurs 
clients sont regroupées sur un même serveur, soulève des enjeux de sécurisation des 
données et de capacité à les auditer.  
 
Plusieurs épisodes récents tels que les sanctions américaines en Crimée (2014) ou la panne 
d’Amazon Web Services (2017) ont illustré les risques et impacts réels sur l’économie d’une 
déstabilisation des activités de paiement. Ils ont ainsi rappelé la nécessité pour la collectivité de 
garder la maîtrise de bout en bout d’une activité essentielle à l’industrie, au commerce et aux services 
publics.  
 
 
2. Face à ces défis, quels rôles pour les banques centrales ? 
Dans cette perspective, les pouvoirs publics chargés de l’évolution du cadre règlementaire applicable 
aux services financiers et les acteurs privés européens ont évidemment un rôle majeur à jouer. 
L’avenir de la souveraineté européenne sur son système de paiement sera d’autant plus 
assuré qu’il pourra en particulier reposer sur la capacité de ses acteurs privés, industriels, 
fintech et intermédiaires financiers à s’adapter et innover de manière continue et à tirer ainsi 
profit pour elles-mêmes et leurs clients d’un marché des paiements ouvert, concurrentiel et 
fortement intégré au plan européen et international.  
Dans l’exercice de leur mandat de supervision, les banques centrales peuvent y contribuer en faisant 
coexister un impératif d’ouverture et d’accompagnement de l’innovation, qui est le propre d’une 
économie insérée dans le commerce mondial au bénéfice du consommateur, avec leur mission 
fondamentale de garant et de promoteur d’une bonne maîtrise des risques.  
Mais elles peuvent aussi y contribuer en s’appuyant sur leurs deux autres modes traditionnels 
d’action, celui de catalyseur et celui de fournisseur de services de règlement en monnaie de 
banque centrale. 
A- Ce rôle de catalyseur me paraît important à exercer dans le domaine des paiements 
« retail ». La monnaie de banque commerciale y représente en effet l’actif de règlement dominant, 
même si l’usage de la monnaie fiduciaire demeure important en France, comme dans la majeure 
partie de l’Union Européenne. Cette diversité des moyens de paiement, appuyée sur des actifs de 
règlement échangeables à tout instant au pair, est un atout qu’il convient, il me semble, de préserver, 
pour plusieurs raisons : au titre de la responsabilité d’inclusion financière d’une part, puisque les 
populations les plus fragiles sont aussi les moins bancarisées ; mais aussi dans une optique de 
5 
 
diversification des risques, dans l’éventualité d’une défaillance généralisée des systèmes de 
paiement électroniques.  
Toutefois, le constat partagé en Europe actuellement est celui d’un risque de fragmentation 
des moyens de paiement scripturaux et de dépendance vis-à-vis d’acteurs dominants 
étrangers, bénéficiant d’effets de réseaux mondiaux. C’est particulièrement vrai des schémas de 
paiement internationaux dans le domaine des paiements carte (Visa, Mastercard), via lesquels 
transitent près des deux tiers des paiements par carte réalisés dans l’Union Européenne, en 
particulier les transactions transfrontières. 18 pays dépendent ainsi entièrement des schémas 
internationaux pour le traitement de leurs transactions domestiques. Le paiement mobile, dont la part 
est en augmentation, dépend en grande partie de concepteurs de systèmes d’exploitation mobiles 
tels que Apple ou Samsung. Par ailleurs, les systèmes privatifs investissant le créneau des 
paiements instantanés se multiplient – on pense par exemple à Paypal, Lydia, mais aussi Alipay qui 
sera bientôt lancé en France -, au risque de mettre à mal l’interbancarité et la concurrence. Les 
restrictions à l’utilisation de certaines solutions propriétaires techniques telles que les capteurs NFC, 
ou logicielles pour l’acceptation des cartes de paiement par exemple, peuvent également représenter 
un obstacle à la libre concurrence.  
D’où l’importance, dans ce contexte, de projets d’intérêt collectif s’inscrivant dans la stratégie 
européenne pour les paiements de « retail », qui a réaffirmé l’importance pour l’UE d’assurer 
l’indépendance de son offre de paiement. Cela me semble être particulièrement le cas du projet 
mené par un collectif d’établissements bancaires visant à proposer une solution de paiement 
paneuropéenne, et désormais connu sous le nom d’European Payment Initiative (EPI). C’est 
pourquoi la Banque de France et l’Eurosystème dans son ensemble encouragent et 
soutiennent cette initiative de marché, qui représenterait un nouveau jalon supplémentaire 
majeur dans la constitution d’un espace européen intégré depuis la constitution de la zone 
SEPA.  
 
B- Les banques centrales peuvent également contribuer comme fournisseur de services de 
règlement en monnaie de banque centrale, particulièrement à destination des intermédiaires 
financiers. La monnaie de banque centrale constitue en effet la pierre angulaire des règlements 
entre les intermédiaires financiers, et elle a toutes les raisons de le rester à l’avenir : l’expérience 
montre que les acteurs financiers ont besoin d’un actif de règlement sans risque. 
 
Pour autant, la perspective du développement de la tokénisation des actifs financiers pose la 
question de l’opportunité d’une tokénisation de leur corollaire, la monnaie de règlement. Cette 
6 
 
observation peut conduire à faire évoluer non pas ce qui constitue le fondement même de la monnaie 
de banque centrale – la confiance - mais ses modalités d’émission. C’est dans ce cadre que 
l’opportunité d’une monnaie digitale de banque centrale dite « de gros » peut s’imposer. Cela 
implique pour les banques centrales d’investir dans les innovations techniques sur 
lesquelles s’appuie la digitalisation des actifs financiers et de leur méthode de transfert, de 
lancer des expérimentations et d’en tirer profit afin d’améliorer les performances des services 
qu’elles fournissent à l’économie. C’est ce que fait la Banque de France. Appuyée sur son Lab, 
elle a investi depuis plusieurs années déjà dans la technologie blockchain, et la met en oeuvre sur 
un plan opérationnel pour la tenue des fichiers des identifiants créanciers SEPA (MADRE-ICS) et 
des implantations bancaires (MADRE-FIB). Un autre exemple récent est le pilotage par la BCE de 
la création de la plateforme de règlement interbancaire TIPS, dans le but d’assurer un 
développement coordonné du paiement instantané.  En inscrivant ses initiatives dans le cadre des 
réflexions de l’Eurosystème sur un « e-euro », la Banque de France va poursuivre et élargir son 
investissement et son expertise en matière d’innovation dans les infrastructures et les moyens de 
paiement. A cette fin, elle vient de faire évoluer son organisation, avec la création d’une Direction 
des infrastructures, de l’innovation et des paiements, elle va renforcer ses moyens dans ce domaine 
et participer je l’espère aux travaux menés au sein de « l’innovation hub » de la BRI. Sur un plan 
opérationnel cet engagement va prochainement la conduire, en étroite relation avec les 
acteurs de la Place, à mener des expérimentations d’intégration de la MDBC dans des 
procédures d’échanges d’actifs tokénisés. À cette fin, un appel à expérimentation sera lancé 
fin mars 2020.  
Conclusion 
Il est indéniable que la numérisation de l’économie a constitué une source de progrès dans le 
domaine des paiements comme ailleurs, en diversifiant et en fluidifiant les services offerts au 
consommateur. Ce bilan positif ne doit cependant pas nous faire oublier l’interdépendance 
croissante des économies, et les risques de souveraineté que cette intermédiation accrue est 
susceptible de poser dans un contexte de tensions commerciales. À la Banque de France et l’ACPR, 
nous sommes prêts à accompagner le marché dans les mutations nécessaires à la préservation et 
au développement d’un écosystème européen dynamique et résilient, capable de garantir le maintien 
de notre souveraineté monétaire et financière. Pour cela, nous n’hésiterons pas à déployer la totalité 
de notre palette d’actions et d’expertise, palette que nous avons enrichie en reconnaissant 
l’importance d’expérimenter avec l’écosystème.

capitaux ». 
 
Sylvie Goulard, Sous-Gouverneure de la Banque de France et Ancienne Ministre des Armées, 
était conviée par l’Association Monégasque des Activités Financières à un déjeuner-
conférence, où elle s’est exprimée sur « L’Europe, tour d’horizon économique et financier ». 
Voici quelques extraits de son discours. 
 
 
Les impacts du Coronavirus sur l’économie. 
 
L’environnement économique et financier change de jour en jour. Le Coronavirus est un 
phénomène sans équivalent et sans précédent dans l’histoire. 
Le virus se répand parce que notre économie mondialisée est caractérisée par un manque de 
« durabibilité » (sustainability), des interdépendances accrues et des inégalités, entre autres 
concernant les systèmes de santé. On observe également une grande volatilité, non 
seulement des marchés, mais aussi des comportements assez émotionnels de nos sociétés, 
encouragés par de nouveaux moyens de communication favorisant l’immédiateté.  
Nous sommes ainsi malheureusement dans une époque de contestation des cadres 
multilatéraux, des règles, des institutions multinationales au moment même où nous allons 
avoir besoin d’un sursaut de coopération. 
Le Coronavirus est évidemment un défi pour les autorités élues, mais il touche aussi les 
banques centrales et les superviseurs, comme en témoigne l’agitation sur les marchés. 
A court terme, l’enjeu primordial est sanitaire. A plus long terme, la question fondamentale 
est la suivante : cette épidémie va-t-elle entraîner des modifications structurelles ? Va-t-on 
observer, par exemple, un changement des modes de production, avec une remise en cause 
des délocalisations d’entreprise, des chaînes de valeur internationales, des 
interdépendances ? A ce stade, il est impossible de le dire. Mais l’on peut se poser la question : 
comment pourrait-on rendre l’économie mondiale plus durable ? 
 
Économie mondiale et croissance. 
 
Pour 2020, les économistes anticipaient en tout début d’année une croissance mondiale d’à 
peu près 3 %, avec une impression de stabilisation voire de légère amélioration. L’OCDE a 
réduit sa prévision à 2,4% la semaine dernière, à la condition que le Coronavirus reste 
cantonné et ne soit pas trop virulent. Selon les autorités chinoises, la situation du pays est à 
peu près sous contrôle désormais. En ce qui concerne l’Italie, où la Lombardie représente 22 % 
du PIB italien, et la Vénétie 10%, on peut imaginer ce que les mesures de quarantaine vont 
signifier pour le pays, sans parler d’autres contagions possibles. 
 
Pour les économistes il y a aujourd’hui un choc négatif et non anticipé de demande. 
La mise à l’arrêt de régions entières entraine une baisse de consommation des entreprises et 
des services. Le tourisme est pratiquement gelé, les transports aériens également. Ces seuls 
secteurs peuvent avoir d’énormes répercussions car la Chine représente 17 % du tourisme 
mondial, et pour l’Italie ce secteur pèse plus de 10 % du PIB. Il y a également un impact sur le 
prix des matières premières, des sources d’énergie. Le prix du pétrole a chuté de 30 %, les 
Saoudiens ayant décidé unilatéralement d’augmenter leur production.  
 
Ce choc est particulièrement significatif car la Chine est l’un des plus importants 
consommateurs de matières premières et d’énergie. 
 
Parallèlement, on constate un choc négatif et non anticipé de l’offre : les usines Peugeot sont 
par exemple presque à l’arrêt. 
 
Le choc d’incertitude est le plus difficile à mesurer. Il porte sur la capacité des entreprises à 
investir. On observe en tous cas une grande volatilité sur les marchés : aux États-Unis, les 
equities ont perdu plus de 10%. N’oublions pas qu’en 2003, époque du SRAS, la Chine 
représentait 6 % des importations et des exportations mondiales, aujourd’hui c’est 10 %. 
 
Des solutions ? 
 
La situation mondiale 
 
La plupart des pays affichent leur volonté d’agir de façon concertée mais les systèmes 
politiques, les sociétés sont différents comme le sont les mandats de certaines institutions. 
Madame Lagarde a annoncé que les réponses de la BCE à la crise seraient proportionnées et 
ciblées mais la BCE, contrairement à la Fed qui est censée assurer un faible taux d’inflation, et 
de chômage, a un mandat étroit, centré sur la stabilité des prix. 
 
Nous sommes déjà dans un contexte de politique monétaire accommodante ; les taux 
d’intérêts sont très bas, voire négatifs. Le bilan des banques centrales a déjà été 
considérablement augmenté, les politiques budgétaires de certains pays sont peu 
prévoyantes : 100 % d’endettement pour la France, 130 % pour l’Italie…les marges de 
manœuvre budgétaire pour ces pays sont donc faibles, surtout si on compare à l’Allemagne 
ou aux Pays-Bas, par exemple. 
 
Avec des taux d’endettement de plus de 300 % par rapport au PIB mondial, et des pays très 
diversement endettés, va-t-on rajouter de la liquidité dans ce contexte de crise ? 
 
Il est également important de rappeler que les tensions commerciales mondiales ne sont 
toujours pas réglées :  les États-Unis et la Chine sont arrivés à un accord, le « Phase One deal », 
qui pour l’avenir, semble porteur d’apaisement, mais sans revenir sur les hausses des droits 
de douane déjà instaurés entre les deux pays. Cela aura forcément un impact indirect sur 
l’Europe. Par ailleurs, le multilatéralisme n’étant pas extrêmement vaillant, nous étions dans 
un contexte tendu, nous sommes maintenant dans un environnement de crise.  
 
L’Europe 
 
En Europe la croissance économique repartait plus modérément mais semblait en voie de 
s’améliorer.  
 
La situation politique est toutefois fragile : quasiment tous les pays de l’Union Européenne 
expérimentent une grande fragmentation politique (c’est le cas en Italie, aux Pays-Bas, en 
Espagne, en Allemagne, en Belgique pour ne citer que ces pays) ; peu de Chefs de 
gouvernement peuvent compter sur une majorité claire et déterminée. La volatilité 
idéologique est frappante.  
 
Par ailleurs, lors du dernier Conseil européen, les chefs d’État et de gouvernement européens 
ne se sont pas mis d’accord sur les perspectives financières de l’Union Européenne qui 
devraient être adoptées fin février dernier. Pour l’instant, nous n’avons donc pas de budget 
pour les sept prochaines années. Chacun sait que la méthode est erronée ; elle consiste à 
mener des négociations à l’unanimité, sans renouvellement suffisant des politiques et pour 
une durée trop longue.  
 
Point positif : depuis la dernière crise, le secteur bancaire est beaucoup plus solide, et les 
mécanismes de supervision plus efficaces. Les banques ont accès à des liquidités à un niveau 
de coût inférieur. Mais l’union économique et monétaire gagnerait à être complétée par des 
mesures encourageant l’union des marchés de capitaux.  
 
Ce tour d’horizon ne serait pas complet sans dire un mot de la sortie du RU de l’UE, le 
« Brexit »  
 
Il ne faut pas en minimiser les implications. C’est le premier départ d’un État membre de 
l’Union Européenne. En 2016, lorsque les Britanniques ont voté à 52 % pour le retrait de 
l’Union européenne, il n’a jamais été précisé sur quelles bases : une sortie maintenant des 
liens étroits et une grande proximité règlementaire (comme avec la Norvège par ex) ou bien 
un éloignement plus radical, où les relations sont essentiellement commerciales ? Le 
gouvernement de Boris Johnson a fait le choix d’une position extrêmement radicale, un « hard 
Brexit » donnant au RU une totale indépendance dans ses choix législatifs, au risque de 
diverger sérieusement. Ce choix n’est pas anodin. 
 
Si nous pouvons avoir l’impression que le Brexit est sans conséquence, c’est que nous sommes 
encore dans une période de transition, maintenant le statu quo. Le Royaume-Uni a bien quitté 
l’UE et ses institutions, juridiquement, le 31 janvier mais il a jusqu’au 31 décembre prochain 
pour négocier un accord sur la relation future.  
 
Les Britanniques voulaient reprendre le contrôle de leur destin ils l’ont fait. Néanmoins l’effet 
d’incertitude sur le Brexit a déjà eu un impact, les investissements ont reculé d’environ 11 % 
au Royaume-Uni depuis 2016, la productivité a baissé, les annonces sur la restriction à 
l’émigration créent des tensions de main d’œuvre notamment dans les secteurs non qualifiés. 
Du côté européen, nous sommes désireux d’aboutir à un accord qui rapprocherait les normes 
de chacun. 
 
Par rapport à l’épidémie, le sujet peut sembler mineur mais il aura une incidence à la fois sur 
nos relations avec ce pays important et comme éventuel précédent si d’autres pays étaient 
tentés de quitter l’UE.

Mesdames et Messieurs, cari professori e studenti,  
Je suis très heureux de partager ce moment avec vous. Et je tiens à remercier 
chaleureusement toutes les personnes qui ont rendu possible cette réunion 
virtuelle, en particulier le Recteur Gianmario Verona et le Vice-recteur Stefano 
Caselli, ainsi que Franscesco Daveri. Pour moi, la Bocconi représente une 
source majeure d’influence en faveur de l’intégration européenne. Évoquons 
quelques uns des grands « bocconiani » qui ont joué un rôle fondamental dans 
la construction de notre union économique : de Luigi Einaudi – le père des pères 
de l’Europe – à mon ami Mario Monti. Je voudrais également rendre hommage 
à Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, disparu il y a maintenant dix ans. Dans la période 
difficile que nous traversons, sa vision et sa capacité à traduire les idéaux 
européens en initiatives concrètes – comme l’euro – demeurent des sources 
d’inspiration.  
Aujourd’hui, je m'exprime devant vous en tant qu’Européen engagé, banquier 
central, mais aussi en tant qu’ami de l’Italie. Je tiens avant tout à exprimer ma 
profonde solidarité : l’Italie, de même que la France, a été l’un des pays le plus 
durement frappés par la pandémie. Je suis également bien conscient des 
critiques à l’encontre d’une Europe qui aurait été trop lente ou réticente à 
apporter son aide. Aussi, mon sujet du jour est-il ambitieux, car j’aborderai la 
question du prétendu manque de solidarité de l’Europe. Je démontrerai tout 
d’abord qu’en réalité l’Europe – et l’Eurosystème en première ligne – ont su 
relever le défi pendant cette phase aiguë de la crise. Mais nous devons faire 
davantage et je présenterai ensuite les grandes lignes d’une stratégie de sortie 
efficace et collective. 
 
I. L’Eurosystème en première ligne de la réponse européenne pendant 
la phase aiguë de la crise 
Les mesures de confinement ont une incidence majeure sur l’économie 
européenne et sur l’économie italienne, qui, selon la Commission européenne, 
pourrait se contracter de 9,5 % en 2020. Face à cette crise sans précédent et 
Page 2 sur 12 
 
 
totalement imprévue, les réponses apportées par les gouvernements 
européens – dont l’Italie – ont été immédiates et fortes.  
Mais de part et d’autre de nos frontières, il existe une tentation commune de 
blâmer une Europe qui n’en ferait pas assez. En réalité, l’Europe agit, et plus 
que l’on ne le reconnaît. Le débat sur les « Coronabonds » a divisé les 
Européens, mais l’action monétaire exceptionnelle de la Banque centrale 
européenne (BCE) – qui est beaucoup plus significative – devrait nous 
rassembler.   
Afin d’accomplir son mandat, l’Eurosystème a toujours été clair dans son 
engagement à assurer des conditions financières appropriées dans l’ensemble 
de la zone euro, et déterminé dans sa lutte contre la fragmentation au sein 
de la zone euro. Nous ne permettrons pas qu’une dynamique de marché 
défavorable entraîne des hausses injustifiées des taux d’intérêt dans certains 
pays, ce qui compromettrait la bonne transmission de notre politique monétaire 
commune. Pour le dire simplement : les rendements et les écarts de rendement 
ont une importance indéniable, même si nous ne ciblons pas de niveau 
déterminé. 
Par conséquent, et afin d’atténuer le risque d’une inflation encore plus faible, 
nous avons annoncé le 18 mars un programme d’achats d’urgence face à la 
pandémie de 750 milliards d'euros (PEPP). La mise en œuvre du PEPP est et 
restera flexible ; l’Eurosystème doit être davantage guidé par la dynamique du 
marché et les conditions de la liquidité que par un volume prédéterminé 
d’achats. Et l’Italie profite des avantages de l’intégration européenne dans la 
mesure où elle emprunte à un taux d’intérêt beaucoup plus faible qu’avant 
l’euro. 
Page 3 sur 12 
 
 
 
Si les écarts de rendement des obligations souveraines italiennes étaient aussi 
importants que ceux enregistrés avant de rejoindre la zone euro – supérieurs 
de plus de 3 % à ceux constatés actuellement – l’Italie devrait supporter une 
charge d’intérêt supplémentaire de plusieurs milliards d’euros pour couvrir la 
nouvelle émission de dette de 2020, qui inclut les coûts de la pandémie de 
Covid. Si l’on applique cet écart à l’encours de la dette italienne, la charge 
d’intérêt supplémentaire s’élèverait à plusieurs dizaines de milliards d’euros.  
 
 
Page 4 sur 12 
 
 
En parallèle, la BCE a considérablement élargi ses opérations de refinancement 
à plus long terme ciblées (TLTRO-III) afin de soutenir [la transmission du] crédit 
bancaire à l’économie réelle. Cela a été moins relevé, mais ces conditions 
favorables sont sans précédent, avec un soutien de la BCE désormais porté à 
50 points de base au-dessous du taux de la facilité de dépôt. Cette incitation en 
faveur du crédit réduira les coûts de financement des banques de plusieurs 
milliards d’euros par an. Le secteur bancaire italien – et par son intermédiaire, 
les entreprises et les ménages italiens – est le principal bénéficiaire des 
opérations de refinancement de la BCE avec près de 30 % du total de l’encours 
des opérations de crédit.  
 
Cela amène certains, dans d’autres pays, à aller jusqu’à prétendre que notre 
politique monétaire est conduite au profit de l’Italie : ils se trompent. La politique 
monétaire n’est pas conduite pour un pays en particulier, qu’il s’agisse de 
l’Allemagne, de la France ou de l’Italie. Le Conseil des gouverneurs prend ses 
Page 5 sur 12 
 
 
décisions de manière collégiale et indépendante, en tenant compte de la zone 
euro dans son ensemble. Cela dit, reconnaissons simplement que 
l’appartenance à l’Union monétaire a fourni à l’Italie un soutien financier 
substantiel dans cette crise. La BCE a efficacement travaillé pour l’Europe et 
pour l’Italie. 
La semaine dernière, le Conseil des gouverneurs a pris note du jugement rendu 
par la Cour constitutionnelle allemande. Permettez-moi d’être tout à fait clair : 
nous demeurons résolus, comme l’a dit la présidente Lagarde ; par ailleurs, 
nous sommes pleinement engagés et déterminés à accomplir notre mandat 
conformément au Traité. Comme l’a dit la Cour de justice européenne, nos 
actions passées sont en effet proportionnées à ce mandat.  
D’une manière plus générale – et en résonance parfois étrange avec la cour de 
justice allemande – j’entends dans nos deux pays des débats semant le doute 
sur (a) l’indépendance de la banque centrale – qui devrait être placée « sous 
contrôle politique » – et, (b) sur son mandat – qui devrait s’étendre au-delà de 
la stabilité des prix, pour inclure l’emploi ou la lutte contre la crise sanitaire. 
Critiquer ces deux piliers est non seulement sans objet, mais également 
dangereux. 
 
<U+F0B7> Sans objet : la BCE s’est montrée, dans son cadre institutionnel et en vertu de 
son mandat, active, innovante et réactive… plus encore que certaines 
institutions politiques. Portez atteinte à l’indépendance de la banque centrale et 
vous compromettez sa puissance et son agilité, qui sont précisément des atouts 
qui protègent une économie durant une crise. 
 
<U+F0B7> Dangereux : ces deux piliers, inscrits dans le Traité, constituent les fondements 
juridiques et démocratiques de notre légitimité et de notre capacité à agir – et 
pas seulement aux yeux des « Nordiques ». En outre, ils constituent le 
fondement de la confiance des Européens dans leur monnaie. Pour citer un seul 
exemple : l’Eurosystème ne peut pas annuler la dette publique, ni juridiquement, 
ni « fiduciairement » : le soupçon de prépondérance budgétaire donnerait lieu à 
Page 6 sur 12 
 
 
une défiance monétaire, comme observé par le passé et plus récemment dans 
certaines économies de marché émergentes. L’indépendance et le mandat de 
stabilité des prix ne font pas obstacle à l’action puissante de la BCE. Au 
contraire, ce sont ses deux meilleurs leviers. J’y reviendrai. 
 
II. Quelles politiques européennes pour une sortie progressive de la 
crise? 
S’agissant de la solidarité européenne, l’Europe aurait sans doute pu faire plus. 
Mais n’oublions pas que le verre est au moins à moitié plein, grâce au soutien 
majeur apporté par l’Eurosystème, mais également grâce au cadre SURE de la 
Commission européenne qui aide à préserver des emplois, et l’accord bienvenu 
conclu vendredi dernier sur des lignes de crédit non conditionnelles du MES 
[Mécanisme européen de stabilité] pour financer les dépenses de santé.  
Penchons-nous à présent sur l’avenir. Et faisons-le ensemble : le Président de 
la République fédérale allemande a lancé un avertissement le mois dernier, 
« l’Allemagne ne pourra pas sortir de la crise forte et en bonne santé si ce n’est 
pas aussi le cas pour ses voisins » i. Bien sûr, la même chose s’applique, par 
exemple, aux Pays-Bas ou à l’Autriche : l’égoïsme d’aujourd’hui pourrait se 
payer au prix fort demain. Et permettez-moi de souligner l’importance cruciale 
des propos tenus, pas plus tard qu’hier, par la Chancelière Merkel : « Cela va 
nous inciter à faire davantage en matière de politique économique, afin de faire 
progresser l’intégration de la zone euro. Nous allons nous pencher sur cette 
question en lien avec ce qu’on appelle le Fonds de relance pour l’Europe ». 
A. Nos objectifs communs : reprise et remise en état  
1/ Soutenir la croissance durant la phase de reprise est un objectif commun 
à nous tous en Europe. En effet, il n’y a pas de solution miracle, et – en fin de 
compte – la dette héritée de la crise devra être financée par la croissance et par 
notre travail. Comme l’a souligné mon collègue et ami le Gouverneur Ignazio 
Visco, « des investissements suffisants dans l’éducation sont [...] nécessaires 
pour faire face à l’incertitude entourant les emplois et les qualifications qui 
Page 7 sur 12 
 
 
importeront dans le futur » ii. Cependant, face à un bouleversement aussi 
majeur que la crise du Covid, l’investissement au niveau national atteindra 
inévitablement ses limites. Confrontés à l’important déficit d’investissement et 
de croissance en Europe, nous devons mettre en place d’importants 
programmes d’investissement européens pour combler ce déficit tout en 
répondant aux priorités structurelles communes telles que le changement 
climatique, qui ne doit absolument pas devenir une victime collatérale de la 
crise, ou bien la transition numérique, qui sera encore davantage qu’avant le 
principal moteur de la productivité future.  
2/ Préserver le marché unique tout en « remettant en état » les entreprises 
constitue notre deuxième objectif commun pour cette phase de reprise. Les 
gouvernements nationaux ont agi de manière appropriée lors de la phase aigüe, 
en adoptant des mesures d’urgence notamment pour apporter des garanties et 
un soutien en liquidité à leurs PME. Mais, comme ces dispositions devront être 
prolongées et transformées en mesures de solvabilité à long terme, des 
différences nationales pourraient créer une « inégalité de traitement ». Un 
marché unique – qui est dans l’intérêt de tous les États membres, à commencer 
par l’Allemagne – signifie des règles communes pour les entreprises : si ce n’est 
pas le cas, la divergence entre nos économies pourrait encore s’accroître, ce 
qui serait très regrettable. La solvabilité des entreprises européennes est notre 
défi commun, et appelle des solutions communes. 
Se concentrer sur ces deux objectifs est plus important que de débattre des 
dettes publiques. Mais par souci de cohérence, permettez-moi de proposer 
deux principes fondamentaux pour ces dernières. Les dettes existantes sont, 
et resteront, de la responsabilité des gouvernements nationaux. Arrêtons ce 
débat stérile au sujet des Euro-obligations et de la mutualisation des dettes 
antérieures. L’assainissement budgétaire demeurera une obligation nationale – 
y compris en France – mais avec un calendrier approprié afin d’éviter un 
resserrement prématuré et procyclique des finances publiques. Par ailleurs, les 
Page 8 sur 12 
 
 
besoins de financement futurs liés à la « reprise et à la remise en état » doivent 
être le domaine naturel où s’exerce la solidarité financière européenne. 
B. Nos instruments communs : conjuguer solidarité et responsabilité 
Je suis convaincu qu’une « stratégie de sortie efficace et collective » doit 
conjuguer quatre piliers de la reprise européenne  – : (i) un « plan de relance » 
ambitieux pour mettre en place une solidarité financière européenne, (ii) une 
clarification des règles budgétaires garantissant la responsabilité des États 
membres, (iii) une Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation 
favorisant le « partage du risque privé », et (iv) une politique monétaire 
accommodante dans un contexte de faible inflation.  
 
 
a/ En ce qui concerne le premier pilier, un « plan de relance » ambitieux, 
le débat s’est concentré jusqu’à présent sur son montant – qui devrait être 
supérieur à 1 000 milliards d’euros, ce qui correspond à peu près à la perte 
attendue pour le PIB européen cette année – ou sur sa structure ; doit-il prendre 
Page 9 sur 12 
 
 
la forme de prêts ou de subventions ? Je vais répondre clairement : il doit allier 
les deux. Par conséquent, comme cela a été approuvé par le Conseil européen 
le 23 avril, il sera essentiel de combiner le Fonds de relance et le prochain cadre 
financier pluriannuel – qui doit être augmenté.  
Mais parlons à présent du contenu de ce fond. Premièrement, il doit cibler des 
investissements qui génèrent un potentiel de croissance supplémentaire. 
Deuxièmement, il doit inclure une « valeur ajoutée européenne », avec des 
répercussions transfrontières positives. Le changement climatique, les 
technologies numériques, la recherche et le développement constituent de bons 
candidats si nous savons être sélectifs. Des institutions « techniques » telles 
que la Banque européenne d’investissement (BEI) pourraient se voir confier 
cette mission, et éventuellement « pari-passu » avec de l’argent privé. S’il s’agit 
d’un simple transfert de financements d’investissements déjà engagés au 
niveau national, cela n’apportera rien et nous pourrions même courir un risque 
de pertes, en cas de mauvaise sélection. 
Au-delà de ce volet « reprise », un volet « remise en état » doit remédier aux 
problèmes de solvabilité croissants. La récente proposition française portant sur 
un fond de relance prévoit la possibilité de mettre en place un fond 
d’investissement pour injecter des capitaux dans des entreprises clés, 
notamment celles qui participent aux chaînes de valeur stratégiques 
européennes, telles qu’elles ont été identifiées par la Commission en 
novembre 2019. Par ailleurs, plusieurs économistes - notamment Elena Carletti, 
Professeur de finance à l’Université Bocconi - ont proposé la piste prometteuse 
d’un fond d’investissement européen temporaire pour la pandémie, (European 
Pandemic Equity Fund ») iii, qui pourrait être géré par la BEI. Celui-ci pourrait 
prendre la forme d’instruments hybrides, sans droits de vote mais avec une 
rémunération significative de l’investissement public, et une option de résiliation 
prédéterminée pour l’entreprise bénéficiaire. De plus, le fonds de relance 
pourrait comporter un outil spécifique pour racheter certains actifs auprès des 
banques.  
Page 10 sur 12 
 
 
 
b/ Une clarification des règles budgétaires. La contrepartie de la solidarité 
financière est la responsabilité des États membres. Les règles actuelles du PSC 
[Pacte de stabilité et de croissance] sont à la fois trop complexes et pas assez 
crédibles. Évidemment, il est nécessaire de maintenir les règles budgétaires – 
permettez-moi de le souligner, au risque d’être impopulaire – mais elles doivent 
évoluer vers davantage de clarté, une meilleure appropriation et un plus grand 
respect par les États membres. Le Comité budgétaire européen avance une 
proposition intéressante, celle de s’appuyer sur un plafond du taux de 
croissance des dépenses publiques primaires, nettes des mesures 
discrétionnaires concernant les recettesiv.   
 
c/ Progresser vers une Union de financement pour l’investissement et 
l’innovation. Les mécanismes de partage du risque privé, qui sont moins 
fréquemment considérés que les mécanismes publics, sont tout aussi 
importants et efficaces, comme nous pouvons l’observer aux États-Unis où les 
marchés de capitaux jouent un rôle plus important que les transferts budgétaires 
comme coussin entre États. Ici, la solidarité et la responsabilité se renforcent 
mutuellement. La zone euro dispose d’une ressource abondante, et rarement 
mentionnée : une épargne excédentaire par rapport à l’investissement, qui 
s’élevait à 360 milliards d’euros l’année dernière. Cette ressource est 
actuellement investie hors de la zone euro, même si nos besoins 
d’investissement potentiels sont importants.  
Une meilleure allocation de l’épargne privée européenne nécessite des canaux 
de financement transfrontières plus efficaces – l'épargne ne se trouve pas 
toujours là où le besoin d’investissement apparaît – ainsi qu’une 
« transformation » plus efficiente : les instruments d’épargne privilégiés sont 
souvent à court terme et sûrs, tandis que les besoins de financement sont 
souvent à plus long terme et plus risqués. Il faut combiner une Union bancaire 
plus efficace et une « Union des marchés de capitaux » pour constituer une 
véritable « Union de financement pour l’investissement et l’innovation ». Les 
Page 11 sur 12 
 
 
gouvernements européens sont tous d’accord sur le principe ; à présent, 
passons enfin des mots aux actes, pour apporter un coup de pouce privé 
important à notre stratégie de sortie collective. 
 
d/ Maintenir une politique monétaire accommodante, dans un contexte de 
faible inflation – 0,4 % en avril dans la zone euro. La plupart des économistes 
considèrent ce choc comme déflationniste et s’attendent à ce qu’il le reste 
durant la phase suivante, la demande à l’échelle mondiale se redressant plus 
lentement que l’offre. Le FMI table sur des taux d’inflation de 0,2 % en 2020 et 
1,0 % en 2021 pour la zone euro. Les prévisions de la Commission européenne 
sont globalement comparables. Je vous rappelle que notre objectif d’une 
inflation « inférieure à mais proche de 2 % » est à la fois symétrique et à 
moyen terme : il ne doit pas constituer un plafond, ni ignorer complètement les 
évolutions antérieures de l’inflation. Comme je l’ai dit, je reste farouchement 
fidèle à notre indépendance monétaire – et opposé à la prépondérance 
budgétaire – ainsi qu’à notre mandat axé sur la stabilité des prix. Mais dans le 
contexte actuel, ce mandat n’empêche pas d’agir : au nom même de notre 
mandat, nous devrons probablement aller plus loin et maintenir des taux 
d’intérêt bas et des liquidités abondantes pendant plus longtemps. 
L’indépendance n’empêche pas non plus la coopération. Au contraire, plus 
l’Union économique est forte – notamment dans ses composantes budgétaire 
et financière – plus l’action monétaire sera efficace. Prenons l’exemple de la 
Réserve fédérale aux États-Unis qui peut compter sur un solide dosage entre 
politique budgétaire et politique monétaire (policy-mix). 
*** 
Au cours des vingt dernières années, la zone euro a essentiellement progressé 
durant les crises. Elle est confrontée aujourd’hui à un autre moment de vérité. 
Tel un fil conducteur, illustré par le célèbre « tout ce qui est nécessaire » de 
Mario Draghi en 2012 (« Whatever it takes »), on retrouve l’engagement sans 
limite de la BCE envers l’euro. Alessandro Manzoni, l’un des plus grands

unis v (« Liberi non sarem se non siam uni »). Aujourd’hui, nous Européens, 
nous ne serons pas maîtres de notre propre destin si nous ne sommes pas unis. 
Il nous faut à présent surmonter la « malinconia » actuelle et relever nos défis 
non pas avec crainte ou méfiance, mais avec fierté. Fierté à l’égard de ce que 
nous avons déjà accompli et fierté à l’égard de l’avenir que nous voulons 
façonner. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Déjeuner-causerie du 11 juin 2012 
Conférence de Montréal 
 
Monsieur le Premier Ministre,  
Monsieur le Gouverneur, 
Monsieur le Président,  
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
C’est un grand honneur et un vrai plaisir pour moi de participer à vos côtés à ce déjeuner-
causerie. Je tiens à remercier le Forum économique international des Amériques ainsi que son 
Président pour l’organisation de cette conférence de Montréal qui s’est imposée, depuis 18 
ans maintenant, comme un évènement économique majeur au plan international.  
 
Je voudrais profiter de cette occasion pour vous faire part de mon analyse de la situation en 
zone euro, des défis qu’il nous faut relever et des solutions qui s’offrent à nous.  
 
Avant cela, je crois qu’il est utile de dire quelques mots sur la situation économique 
internationale.  
 
Au niveau mondial, la croissance devrait ralentir légèrement en 2012 par rapport à 2011, 
notamment du fait du ralentissement en Europe et un peu aussi dans les pays émergents, en 
particulier en Chine. Les États-Unis connaissent une reprise relativement dynamique, mais 
sont confrontés à de nombreux défis, aux niveaux budgétaire et immobilier notamment.  
 
Dans l’ensemble, - et c’est une des choses que la crise a rappelées avec une grande acuité 
depuis 2008 – les différentes zones économiques du monde sont très étroitement 
interconnectées; les problèmes finissent par être partagés et donc certaines solutions ne 
peuvent être trouvées qu’à l’échelle internationale. C’est la raison pour laquelle le G20 a pris 
une ampleur nouvelle depuis 2008.  
 
Il faut aujourd’hui continuer à avancer dans la voie de la coopération internationale, en 
particulier pour identifier et résorber les sources de déséquilibres macroéconomiques au 
moyen du « cadre pour une croissance forte, durable et équilibrée » et pour améliorer la 
régulation financière internationale. Dans ce dernier domaine, il est primordial de toujours 
2 
 
conserver à l’esprit le double objectif qui nous anime : renforcer la stabilité financière tout en 
préservant le financement de l’économie.  
 
Je voudrais à présent centrer mon propos sur la situation en zone euro.  
 
Comme vous le savez, en 2011, la crise des dettes souveraines en zone euro a été 
particulièrement violente, se propageant à des pays aux fondamentaux économiques sains. 
 
Les trois premiers mois de 2012 avaient montré quelques signes d’amélioration, notamment 
dus aux initiatives de l’Eurosystème et aux impulsions politiques positives : la pression sur les 
dettes souveraines s’était un peu apaisée, le financement bancaire s’était amélioré, de même 
que le fonctionnement des marchés monétaires. 
 
Depuis le mois d’avril, la tendance s’est à nouveau  inversée et les tensions, notamment sur 
les dettes souveraines et les banques, se sont à nouveau accrues. Deux facteurs en particulier 
expliquent ce mouvement : les difficultés budgétaires et bancaires de l’Espagne – difficultés 
auxquelles le plan adopté ce week-end devrait répondre efficacement - et, surtout, les grandes 
incertitudes politiques en Grèce. 
 
Par conséquent, un sérieux travail est requis sur plusieurs fronts si l’on veut que l’Europe 
trouve une solution durable à la crise.  
 
D’abord, le défi auquel la plupart des pays de la zone euro sont confrontés consiste 
évidemment à réaliser un redressement budgétaire crédible tout en assurant la croissance à 
long terme. De mon point de vue, il n’existe aucune contradiction entre ces deux objectifs. Ils 
sont au contraire complémentaires.  
 
Les efforts accomplis par la zone euro sur le plan budgétaire commencent à porter leurs 
fruits : non seulement le niveau absolu du déficit de la zone euro est deux fois plus bas 
qu’ailleurs, mais le rythme du redressement budgétaire y est également beaucoup plus rapide. 
Cela représente évidemment à l’heure actuelle un atout pour nous et c’est un facteur de 
confiance à la fois pour les marchés et pour les agents économiques, qu’il convient de 
renforcer davantage. Dans le même temps, les pays de la zone doivent créer les conditions 
d’une croissance solide et soutenable en adoptant des réformes structurelles fortes. Là encore, 
les progrès déjà réalisés dans de nombreux pays sont impressionnants mais ils doivent être 
poursuivis, notamment en ce qui concerne les marchés du travail, des biens et des services. 
 
Au-delà de ces efforts au niveau national, je pense sincèrement que la véritable nécessité pour 
la zone euro à l’heure actuelle, c’est de progresser vers une union économique et financière 
plus cohérente et plus intégrée.  
 
En effet, la crise a clairement mis en évidence un certain nombre de faiblesses dans le 
fonctionnement de la zone euro, nourrissant ainsi les inquiétudes.  
En premier lieu, le mécanisme de discipline budgétaire fondé sur la pression par les pairs, mis 
en place par le Pacte de stabilité et de croissance, s’est avéré faible. En deuxième lieu, la zone 
euro ne s’est pas dotée dès le départ d’un instrument permettant de surveiller l’évolution de la 
compétitivité. Enfin, elle n’avait pas mis en place de mécanisme de gestion des crises avant le 
début de la crise.  
 
3 
 
Je pense que des décisions importantes ont été prises sur ces trois points et qu’elles devraient 
entraîner des améliorations importantes si elles sont intégralement mises en œuvre :  
<U+F02D> L’Europe a largement renforcé son cadre de discipline budgétaire. Le paquet législatif 
(appelé six-pack), entré en vigueur en décembre, renforce considérablement le Pacte 
de stabilité et de croissance : les pouvoirs de surveillance de la Commission 
européenne sur les budgets nationaux ont été accrus, les sanctions sont à présent quasi-
automatiques, les critères de dette publique et de dépenses publiques font l’objet d’un 
suivi plus attentif et un nouveau cadre de surveillance des déséquilibres 
macroéconomiques et de l’évolution de la compétitivité a été adopté. En outre, 
25 chefs d’État ou de gouvernement européens ont signé le Traité sur la stabilité, la 
coordination et la gouvernance qui met en place un nouveau « pacte budgétaire », 
comportant l’exigence que le déficit public structurel annuel ne dépasse pas 0,5 % du 
PIB. Ces nouvelles règles doivent maintenant être intégralement mises en œuvre par 
chaque pays.  
<U+F02D> Par ailleurs, l’Europe s’est dotée d’un instrument de lutte contre les crises. Lors des 
dernières réunions du Conseil européen, il a été décidé d’avancer l’entrée en vigueur 
du Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES), structure permanente appelée à être 
opérationnelle en juillet 2012, et d’augmenter ses moyens, en portant sa capacité de 
prêt à 1 000 milliards de dollars. Il est absolument nécessaire que ce puissant outil 
devienne pleinement opérationnel dès que possible.  
 
Je pense qu’il y a un autre facteur très important qui explique pourquoi la crise frappe si 
durement la zone euro : c’est le fait que nous sommes une zone économique très intégrée 
financièrement, sans pour autant avoir de mécanismes institutionnels pour accompagner cette 
intégration. Ceci explique notamment les effets de contagion et les cercles vicieux entre 
banques et États, qui ont largement amplifié les difficultés de la zone.  
 
À l’évidence, un fonctionnement harmonieux et cohérent du secteur bancaire est absolument 
essentiel à une solution globale à la crise de la zone euro. Cette conviction repose sur deux 
observations fondamentales :  
<U+F02D> un financement approprié est indispensable pour que nos économies connaissent une 
croissance forte et durable. En Europe, le système bancaire est la principale source de 
financement, et sa solidité revêt par conséquent une importance cruciale. Toutefois, les 
marchés financiers jouent naturellement aussi un rôle essentiel et ils doivent avant tout 
servir l’économie.  
<U+F02D> Par ailleurs, la stabilité financière est essentielle, et pas seulement pour créer les 
conditions propices à un financement approprié de l’économie. Elle est également un 
atout inestimable pour favoriser la confiance, qui a cruellement fait défaut ces 
dernières années et qui constitue une autre condition clé pour la croissance. C’est 
également une condition indispensable à l’efficacité de la politique monétaire, car elle 
permet un fonctionnement normal des mécanismes de transmission monétaire. De 
plus, compte tenu des interactions entre banques et emprunteurs souverains et de 
l’incidence potentielle d’une crise financière sur la situation budgétaire d’un pays, la 
stabilité financière apporte une contribution majeure à la stabilité budgétaire.  
 
Un fonctionnement harmonieux du secteur bancaire apparaît donc clairement comme un 
élément essentiel pour résoudre les problèmes de l’Europe. En tant que banquier central et 
superviseur, je vois trois outils majeurs susceptibles de contribuer à garantir un financement 
approprié de l’économie et la stabilité financière, qui sont des conditions financières 
essentielles à une croissance durable.  
4 
 
 
1. La régulation et la surveillance financières doivent être pensées avec ces deux exigences en 
tête : renforcer le secteur financier et continuer à garantir un financement approprié de 
l’économie. Évidemment, après la crise financière de 2008, la priorité la plus urgente était de 
rétablir la stabilité financière et de renforcer la résistance aux chocs financiers. Mais dans le 
processus de mise en œuvre des nouvelles règles de Bâle 3, nous devons accorder la plus 
grande attention à leurs conséquences potentielles pour le financement de l’économie, compte 
tenu notamment d’un calendrier beaucoup plus serré. En particulier, les nouvelles règles 
relatives à la liquidité doivent être ajustées. De plus, il faut à présent aller beaucoup plus loin 
s’agissant du shadow banking.  
 
2. Depuis le début de la crise, l’Eurosystème a constamment apporté au système bancaire tout 
le soutien possible, dans les limites de son mandat, pour l’aider à surmonter ses difficultés. 
Par exemple, les deux opérations principales de refinancement à plus long terme avaient pour 
objet d’atténuer les tensions sur le financement afin de permettre aux banques de s’adapter 
plus facilement aux nouvelles règles et à un environnement difficile. Elles visaient 
simultanément à éviter une contraction du crédit importante qui aurait pu compromettre à la 
fois le financement de l’économie et le maintien de la stabilité des prix dans la zone euro. 
Nous continuerons à poursuivre ces objectifs, sans rien concéder sur notre mission première 
ni sur notre indépendance.  
 
3. Au delà de l’action de l’Eurosystème inscrite dans le Traité, la zone euro a besoin d’une 
nouvelle avancée concrète vers un renforcement de l’intégration financière. Il est vrai que 
nous avons fait de grandes avancées vers plus de régulation et créé de nouveaux outils mais 
les différents épisodes de la crise ont prouvé qu’une union monétaire peut être plus forte si 
elle s’appuie sur un système financier dont la santé ne dépend pas, in fine, de mécanismes 
nationaux :  
 
<U+F02D> un système financier uniformément sain est essentiel pour la bonne transmission de la 
politique monétaire unique de la zone euro ;  
<U+F02D> aussi longtemps que la santé financière de la zone euro sera à la merci des problèmes 
rencontrés par l’un des pays membres, des interactions négatives entre risque 
souverain et risque bancaire risquent de se matérialiser : c’est précisément ce que l’on 
a observé dans la zone euro ; 
<U+F02D> dans une union monétaire, le capital peut circuler librement et très rapidement d’un 
pays à l’autre, ce qui accroît l’incidence potentielle des « paniques bancaires » en 
l’absence de mécanismes supranationaux de garantie des dépôts. 
 
Par conséquent, nous devons construire une vrai structure fédérale de la zone euro, un 
organisme combinant les fonctions du FDIC avec les pouvoirs du Système de Réserve fédéral 
serait particulièrement bénéfique pour l’avenir de la zone. Il devrait être investi de trois 
grands pouvoirs :  
<U+F02D> la supervision bancaire (peut-être avec le même type de structure que l’Eurosystème, 
c’est-à-dire doté d’une instance à sa tête mais avec une mise en œuvre décentralisée) ;  
<U+F02D> la garantie des dépôts, assortie d’une puissance de feu massive, dans la mesure où cet 
organisme pourrait prélever une taxe sur chaque banque de la zone euro et emprunter 
sur les marchés en bénéficiant d’une garantie supranationale ;  
<U+F02D> la résolution des défaillances bancaires (gestion de crise).  
 
5 
 
Bien entendu, une telle avancée implique de nombreuses étapes et l’élimination d’un grand 
nombre d’obstacles importants. Mais ce qu’elle requiert surtout, c’est une volonté politique 
sans faille, de la part de l’ensemble des membres de la zone euro, d’évoluer vers une union 
économique et monétaire plus forte et plus cohérente. Après tout, les plus grandes avancées 
du projet européen ont toujours été accomplies en réaction aux crises. Et nous devons nous 
rappeler de cette phrase de Jean Monnet : « l’Europe est née des crises, elle sera la réponse 
apportée aux crises ».

Conférence du GIC : « La crise financière mondiale : les enseignements du Japon » 
Tokyo, 1er décembre 2012 
Christian NOYER, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Session 1 – Politique monétaire : « Comment faire face à la crise financière actuelle ? » 
 
 
Cinq ans après le début de la crise, le rôle des banques centrales semble avoir considérablement 
évolué. La manière dont les banques centrales exercent leurs tâches et accomplissent leurs missions a 
subi des changements nombreux et significatifs. Il est difficile de dire si nous assistons à des écarts 
temporaires par rapport à la normale ou à des transformations irréversibles. Selon une opinion souvent 
exprimée, la crise a fait entrer les banques centrales dans une ère nouvelle où l’indépendance, en 
particulier, ne peut être tenue pour acquise. Je ne partage pas cette analyse. Certes, les banques 
centrales du monde entier ont endossé des responsabilités exceptionnelles. Mais elles ont également 
fait face à des circonstances exceptionnelles. Et elles ont agi en toute indépendance et conformément à 
leurs mandats.  
Je considère également que, sans ces actions, la crise aurait entraîné de bien plus grands dommages 
aux économies avancées. À de nombreuses reprises, des interventions déterminées des banques 
centrales ont stabilisé les marchés financiers alors que se développaient des spirales préjudiciables et 
des mouvements de panique. Les banques centrales ont dû constamment faire face à des 
dysfonctionnements des marchés du crédit et des capitaux, résultant d’une aversion au risque 
excessive.  
Ces interventions ont largement réussi à éviter la déflation et une baisse cumulative du PIB au cours 
des phases les plus aiguës de la crise. Il n’en reste pas moins que, contrairement aux épisodes passés 
consécutifs à de profondes récessions, la reprise actuelle apparaît lente, incertaine et fragile. 
L’environnement de la croissance mondiale reste marqué par de fortes incertitudes. Aujourd’hui, 
2 
 
j’aimerais me livrer à une réflexion sur ces évolutions et en particulier sur les problèmes auxquels 
seront confrontées les banques centrales dans le contexte de l’après-crise. 
 
 
1/ Permettez-moi de commencer par quelques faits stylisés 
Le premier, et le plus visible, est l’expansion spectaculaire des bilans des banques centrales. Dans 
toutes les économies avancées, leur taille a été multipliée, en quatre ans, par un facteur de deux à cinq. 
Il s’agit d’une évolution sans précédent. Outre celles des économies avancées, les banques centrales 
des économies émergentes ont également, dans une moindre mesure, accru la taille de leur bilan, 
essentiellement, mais pas uniquement, en raison de leurs interventions sur le change.  
Une deuxième caractéristique, qui est liée, est la diversification des interventions des banques 
centrales. Avant la crise, celles-ci conduisaient la politique monétaire en fixant le taux directeur et, 
dans certains pays, en imposant aux banques la constitution de réserves obligatoires. La crise a 
entraîné l’apparition et la prolifération de mesures dites « non conventionnelles », avec deux objectifs. 
Premièrement, remédier aux perturbations des marchés financiers et, deuxièmement, poursuivre 
l’orientation monétaire accommodante une fois les taux directeurs ramenés à de très bas niveaux et la 
« borne du taux zéro » atteinte. 
La plupart, mais non la totalité, des mesures non conventionnelles ont amené les banques centrales à 
utiliser et accroître la taille de leur bilan afin d’influer sur un plus grand nombre de paramètres 
financiers : les taux d’intérêt à long terme, les spreads de crédit et les volumes de crédit. Dans la zone 
euro, l’essentiel des interventions avaient pour but de fournir de la liquidité au système bancaire en 
quantité illimitée, d’abord grâce à la procédure d’« appels d’offres à taux fixe et à allocation 
intégrale » adoptée en 2008, puis par un allongement progressif des échéances, qui a culminé avec les 
deux opérations de refinancement à plus long terme d’une durée de trois ans. D’autres banques 
centrales, et plus récemment l’Eurosystème, ont eu recours à des achats d’actifs, tant privés que 
publics, parfois à grande échelle. Des indications dites « prospectives » concernant les taux d’intérêt 
ont été utilisées, notamment aux États-Unis, pour influencer les anticipations relatives à ces taux et 
infléchir la courbe des rendements vers le bas. 
Plus récemment, des innovations supplémentaires ont été introduites au Royaume-Uni et au Japon, où 
les banques centrales ont pris des mesures de stimulation directe des crédits privés à l’économie. Ces 
actions associaient mesures réglementaires et opérations d’apport de liquidité ciblées, comme le 
dispositif de financement funding for lending mis en œuvre au Royaume-Uni. 
3 
 
2/ Il est important de noter qu’aucune de ces évolutions n’a été imposée aux banques centrales par les 
autorités. Dans tous les pays, les mesures non conventionnelles et l’expansion consécutive des bilans 
ont constitué une réponse délibérée et volontaire aux évolutions des marchés financiers qui menaçaient 
leur intégrité, leur fonctionnement et la stabilité de l’ensemble de l’économie.  
Ces mesures n’ont pas non plus été programmées à l’avance. Les banques centrales ont dû réagir à des 
évolutions inattendues sans vraiment disposer de précédents historiques pour guider leur action. 
Globalement, la réponse à la crise a principalement consisté en un processus d’« apprentissage par la 
pratique ». 
Toutefois, avec le recul, on discerne une logique sous-jacente à l’ensemble de ces interventions.  
Premièrement, après l’éclatement de la bulle du crédit, toutes les économies avancées ont amorcé une 
phase de désendettement, visant à inverser et absorber les excès de la période qui avait précédé la 
crise. Le désendettement, qui consiste fondamentalement en une contraction des bilans, a concerné 
presque tous les secteurs de nos économies : les banques, naturellement, les ménages (aux États-Unis 
et au Royaume-Uni) et, à présent, les États. Le désendettement est inévitable et nécessaire. Les 
emprunteurs aussi bien que les prêteurs ont besoin de rétablir des niveaux de dette soutenables afin de 
relancer le crédit et de restaurer le financement normal de l’économie sur la durée. Mais le 
désendettement génère d’énormes difficultés à court terme. Il peut être extrêmement déflationniste car 
il implique à la fois une contraction de la monnaie et du crédit et une augmentation des taux d’épargne. 
Dans une certaine mesure, les banques centrales ont contrecarré cette évolution. En augmentant la 
taille de leurs bilans, elles ont accru leur endettement quand les autres agents économiques (à 
l’exception des grandes entreprises) se désendettaient tous simultanément.  
Deuxièmement, l’incertitude créée par la crise a entraîné une augmentation de la demande d’actifs sûrs 
et liquides. Dans le même temps, l’offre de ces actifs s’est sensiblement réduite, notamment en 
Europe, depuis l’apparition d’un risque de crédit sur la dette de l’État. Dans une certaine mesure, les 
banques centrales ont en partie comblé cet écart entre la demande et l’offre en apportant aux 
intermédiaires financiers les actifs les plus sûrs et les plus liquides qui soient : leurs propres 
engagements, sous forme des dépôts et réserves détenus par les banques. L’importance et l’utilité de 
cette fonction est illustrée par les encours importants de la facilité de dépôt de l’Eurosystème ou des 
réserves non obligatoires. 
En effet, il est naturel historiquement pour  les banques centrales d’intervenir lorsque des perturbations 
apparaissent sur les marchés financiers et de limiter les dommages durables à l’économie. Si elles 
n’agissent pas, des anticipations auto-réalisatrices peuvent entraîner une panique et un marasme 
financier.  
4 
 
Un bon exemple en est donné par la situation observée dans la zone euro au deuxième trimestre de 
cette année. Semaine après semaine, les signes d’un « risque de convertibilité » perçu entre les 
différentes régions de la zone se sont accumulés. Bien qu’infondées, ces craintes auto-réalisatrices ont 
déstabilisé les flux de capitaux et entraîné une segmentation rapide et de plus en plus prononcée des 
marchés financiers et du crédit. Les conditions financières présentaient des divergences de plus en plus 
marquées au sein de la zone euro et ce, indépendamment de la qualité de signature des emprunteurs et 
du niveau des taux directeurs. Si on lui avait donné libre cours, ce processus aurait rendu la politique 
monétaire complètement inopérante pour combattre aussi bien l’inflation que la déflation, dans 
l’éventualité où l’un ou l’autre de ces risques se serait matérialisé. Cette situation était inacceptable 
pour l’Eurosystème. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a donc décidé d’annoncer, en septembre, 
l’introduction du programme d’opérations monétaires sur titres (Outright monetary transactions – 
OMT), qui permet à l’Eurosystème d’acheter de la dette publique assortie d’une échéance inférieure 
ou égale à trois ans. Comme vous le savez, les OMT, ex ante illimitées dans le temps et en quantité, 
sont strictement subordonnées à la mise en œuvre par le pays considéré d’un programme le rendant 
éligible aux financements du Mécanisme européen de stabilité (MES).  
3) Par définition, les mesures non conventionnelles ont un caractère très innovant et les banques 
centrales ont déployé de grands efforts et consacré d’importantes ressources afin d’expliquer leur 
bien-fondé et leurs modalités. Néanmoins, des malentendus et des inquiétudes subsistent et je vais 
brièvement tenter de les dissiper et d’y répondre.  
En premier lieu, j’évoquerai les craintes que l’ensemble du processus d’expansion des bilans ne soit 
inflationniste. En effet, l’un des effets importants des politiques non conventionnelles est d’accroître 
de façon significative la quantité de monnaie de banque centrale dans l’économie. Comme, finalement, 
l’inflation est toujours et partout un phénomène monétaire, il peut sembler logique de s’attendre à un 
regain de tensions inflationnistes. Je comprends ces préoccupations, mais, dans la situation actuelle, 
elles ne me semblent pas fondées. Il est vrai que la monnaie de banque centrale a fortement augmenté 
et que la situation doit faire l’objet d’un suivi en conséquence. Toutefois, ce qui importe, pour 
l’inflation, c’est l’évolution des agrégats monétaires larges, qui détermine la capacité des agents du 
secteur privé d’acheter des biens et, partant, le niveau des prix. Ces agrégats larges sont demeurés 
stables, ou n’ont progressé que très lentement. En fait, la monnaie au sens large a été remplacée par la 
monnaie de banque centrale, les agents économiques ayant jugé nécessaire de détenir des actifs plus 
liquides et moins risqués. Cette expansion de la monnaie de banque centrale n’a pas affecté les 
anticipations d’inflation qui sont demeurées solidement ancrées.  
Si la situation changeait, rien n’a été fait qui soit susceptible de compromettre notre capacité à remplir 
notre mission première, le maintien de la stabilité des prix. Nous disposons de nombreux outils 
permettant, le cas échéant, d’absorber de la liquidité.  
5 
 
Des inquiétudes ont également été exprimées dans la zone euro s’agissant des achats de dette publique, 
qui constitueraient une forme de « financement monétaire » des États. Vous n’ignorez pas que ces 
achats sont explicitement autorisés par le Traité. Sur le plan juridique, aucun problème ne se pose. 
Qu’en est-il d’un point de vue économique ? Cette question peut être scindée en deux volets. Tout 
d’abord, l’impact sur les marchés. Certes, ces achats peuvent entraîner une baisse des taux d’intérêt. 
C’est leur objectif. Les OMT ne seront mises en œuvre que dans l’hypothèse où le Conseil des 
gouverneurs aurait constaté que les marchés obligataires ne fonctionnent plus correctement, d’où des 
distorsions de taux d’intérêt. Enfin, l’aléa moral suscite de sérieuses inquiétudes. La baisse des taux 
d’intérêt déclenchée par des achats sur le marché secondaire pourrait créer de mauvaises incitations, 
faire obstacle à la discipline de marché et retarder les nécessaires efforts d’ajustement budgétaire. 
C’est la véritable raison de la conditionnalité stricte et explicite attachée aux OMT. 
4) Les banques centrales ont été actives ; elles ont fait preuve d’audace ; mais elles ne disposent pas 
d’un pouvoir illimité. Le moment est peut-être bien choisi pour réfléchir à ce que la politique 
monétaire peut et ne peut pas faire. Je m’attacherai à une question spécifique : les fameux 
« rendements décroissants » des mesures de politique monétaire non conventionnelles. L’argument est 
le suivant : la croissance des bilans et le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt créent des déséquilibres 
potentiels dans le secteur financier. Au delà d’un certain stade, le coût potentiel et l’instabilité liés à 
ces déséquilibres l’emportent sur les bénéfices à court terme pour l’économie.  
Il y a là, de fait, un arbitrage difficile. L’objectif même de ces politiques non conventionnelles est 
d’inciter à une certaine prise de risque, d’encourager le rééquilibrage des portefeuilles et de stimuler 
l’activité de prêt du secteur privé. Il y a évidemment deux écueils à éviter : une prise de risques 
inappropriés n’apportant rien à l’économie productive et le fait que le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt 
favorise une recherche de rendement au travers d’actifs spéculatifs. La situation nécessite donc un 
calibrage très subtil de notre orientation globale. Il est aujourd’hui essentiel d’examiner attentivement 
l’incidence conjointe des politiques monétaires et prudentielles, à la fois sur les exigences de fonds 
propres et de liquidité, pour s’assurer qu’elles ne provoqueront pas d’effets indésirables sur 
l’allocation du capital. 
5) L’action des banques centrales ne se limite pas à la lutte contre la crise et à la stabilisation du 
système financier. Dans la zone euro, sous l’impulsion du Conseil européen, nous nous employons à 
construire un système financier plus robuste et plus efficace. Une faiblesse majeure, révélée par la 
crise, est la corrélation qui existe entre banques et emprunteurs souverains et qui fait que tout choc 
budgétaire négatif ou toute mauvaise nouvelle a immédiatement des répercussions défavorables sur les 
conditions globales de financement du secteur privé. Et, dans le même temps, les difficultés subies par 
les banques donnent lieu à des anticipations d’un renflouement par l’État, ce qui entraîne une 
détérioration de la solvabilité perçue de l’emprunteur souverain. De telles interactions négatives très 
6 
 
puissantes ont été à l’œuvre pendant les phases critiques de la crise au cours des deux dernières 
années.  
L’objectif de l’Union bancaire, décidée en juin, est de rompre ce lien et de créer, dans un premier 
temps, un mécanisme de surveillance unique dans la zone euro sous les auspices de la BCE. Il est 
essentiel que l’Union bancaire soit mise en œuvre rapidement et couvre l’ensemble des établissements 
de crédit. Elle restaurera la confiance dans le système bancaire. Elle rétablira le fonctionnement 
normal de la politique monétaire. Elle désegmentera les marchés financiers et normalisera les flux de 
capitaux privés dans la zone euro. Enfin, elle permettra à l’Eurosystème de se désengager de 
l’intermédiation interbancaire et financière. Une avancée décisive sur la voie d’une Union bancaire 
contribuera fortement à réduire les incertitudes et à renforcer la confiance. 
Conclusion: La capacité de la politique monétaire à lutter contre l’incertitude 
L’incertitude constitue une cause majeure de la faiblesse de la reprise actuelle. On pourrait souligner le 
paradoxe que constitue l’environnement présent, caractérisé par un niveau très bas des taux d’intérêt, 
de très importantes réserves de trésorerie des entreprises et très peu d’investissement. La bonne 
nouvelle, c’est qu’une petite étincelle pourrait avoir des effets considérables. La mauvaise nouvelle, 
c’est qu’elle ne s’est pas encore produite.  
La politique monétaire, en soi, ne peut venir à bout de l’incertitude économique. Elle peut contribuer à 
limiter et à atténuer ses effets. Il est également essentiel de traiter d’autres sources d’incertitude, en 
particulier quand elles sont liées aux politiques publiques. Dans la zone euro, l’assainissement 
budgétaire doit se poursuivre et les mécanismes de gestion des crises doivent être rendus 
opérationnels. Dans d’autres pays, comme les États-Unis et le Japon, il convient d’éliminer les futures 
incertitudes budgétaires. Enfin, des régimes réglementaires stables, tout particulièrement dans le 
secteur financier, sont également essentiels. 
Pour sa part, la politique monétaire doit être prévisible, non pas au sens où la moindre décision des 
autorités monétaires devrait pouvoir être anticipée avec précision, mais plutôt au sens où leurs 
objectifs doivent être clairs et leurs actions parfaitement compréhensibles pour les agents 
économiques. Des banques centrales fortes, indépendantes et responsables sont plus que jamais 
nécessaires à la stabilité des prix et à la stabilité financière.

Paris Europlace Financial Forum 
Tokyo, 3 décembre 2012 
« La zone euro avance dans la bonne direction » 
 
 
Cher Gouverneur, 
Mesdames et Messieurs,  
C’est un réel plaisir d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui et je tiens à remercier l’ensemble de l’équipe Paris 
Europlace pour l’excellente organisation de cet événement au Japon.  
 
Je voudrais commencer par faire un point sur la situation actuelle : 
<U+F0B7> L’activité économique est faible dans la zone euro. Le PIB en volume s’est contracté de 0,1 % 
au troisième trimestre après avoir reculé de 0,2 % au deuxième trimestre. Cette faiblesse des 
performances devrait se poursuivre au cours des prochains mois. C’est une période difficile, 
qui se traduit notamment par un chômage très élevé dans toute la zone. Mais il faut bien voir 
que cette faiblesse de l’activité est en grande partie due au nécessaire processus d’ajustement 
des bilans dans les secteurs financier et non financier. Ce processus est en cours, il produit 
déjà des résultats significatifs et conditionne la reprise forte et durable à venir. 
<U+F0B7> La situation financière de la zone euro s’améliore depuis plusieurs mois. a) Les taux des 
obligations souveraines à long terme se sont fortement détendus pour plusieurs pays : en 
Espagne par exemple, le taux à dix ans a perdu environ 200 points de base depuis le mois de 
juillet. Dans les pays du « cœur » de la zone euro, ils sont restés à des niveaux très faibles 
(légèrement supérieurs à 2 % en France, par exemple) ;  
<U+F0B7> b) Nous voyons des money market funds américains revenir en zone euro ;  
c) Nous voyons davantage d’émissions non sécurisées et d’émissions d’obligations privées.  
Autant de signes positifs – parmi d’autres – qui témoignent d’un retour progressif de la confiance dans 
la zone euro.  
 
Je crois pouvoir dire que les causes fondamentales de la crise dans la zone euro sont maintenant 
complètement intégrées par tous les acteurs, de sorte que chacun a une vision claire et juste de ses 
responsabilités propres. Ces causes sont au nombre de trois : 
 
 
2 
 
<U+F0B7> Un manque de discipline budgétaire ;  
<U+F0B7> Une compétitivité dégradée ;  
<U+F0B7> Une intégration européenne incomplète.  
Je voudrais vous montrer que la zone euro avance aujourd’hui résolument dans la bonne direction pour 
remédier à chacune de ces causes.  
 
A. Les gouvernements redressent leurs finances publiques et leur compétitivité, et l’intégration 
européenne progresse.  
 
En premier lieu, les efforts accomplis par les pays de la zone euro sur le plan budgétaire portent déjà 
leurs fruits : le solde primaire de la zone euro devrait être proche de l’équilibre fin 2012, ce qui 
constitue une performance remarquable par rapport aux autres grandes zones économiques du monde. 
Le déficit public de la zone euro est revenu de 6,3 % en 2009 à 4,1 % en 2011. Cela représente à 
l’heure actuelle évidemment un atout pour nous et un facteur de confiance à la fois pour les marchés et 
pour les agents économiques, qu’il convient de renforcer davantage.  
Au-delà de ces efforts au niveau national, un cadre largement renforcé de discipline commune a été 
mis en place, ce qui constitue une avancée importante vers une union économique plus intégrée.  
Il est essentiel que tous les efforts dans ce domaine soient poursuivis avec détermination. 
 
S’agissant à présent de la compétitivité, là encore les progrès déjà réalisés en termes de réformes 
structurelles et d’ajustement des coûts unitaires de production dans de nombreux pays sont très 
encourageants. Jamais, dans le passé récent, les économies européennes ne se sont autant réformées en 
aussi peu de temps. Je pourrais citer de nombreux exemples : l’Espagne (réforme du marché du travail 
et du secteur financier), l’Italie (réforme des retraites et du marché de services) et la France, qui a mis 
en œuvre une importante réforme de son régime de retraites en 2010 et où des réformes structurelles du 
marché du travail et du marché des biens et des services sont en préparation.  
Ces réformes structurelles constituent les fondements nécessaires à une croissance future à la fois 
dynamique et durable et elles doivent être vigoureusement poursuivies. En outre, au niveau européen, le 
nouveau Pacte de stabilité comprend un mécanisme de surveillance des déséquilibres 
macroéconomiques, qui faisait défaut jusqu’à présent. 
 
Enfin, les institutions sous-tendant la zone euro sont en train de se renforcer extrêmement rapidement 
du fait de la crise. 
<U+F0B7> J’ai déjà mentionné le cadre de discipline budgétaire et macroéconomique largement renforcé : 
il faut se rendre compte qu’il s’agit d’une étape très importante, compte tenu des transferts de 
souveraineté que cela représente. Nous avançons vers une union économique plus forte. 
 
 
3 
 
<U+F0B7> Le Mécanisme européen de stabilité dispose d’une force de frappe de 700 milliards d’euros 
pour acheter directement des obligations d’État, apporter des garanties ou prêter des fonds. Il 
pourra en outre, à terme, prêter directement de l’argent aux banques en difficulté, sans 
augmenter la dette de leur pays d’origine. L’Europe s’est ainsi dotée d’un outil puissant de 
résolution des crises. 
<U+F0B7> Les travaux sur la mise en place de l’union bancaire avancent rapidement eux aussi. Le rapport 
de la Commission remis il y a quelques semaines pose des bases claires : toutes les banques de 
la zone euro seront rapidement soumises à une supervision unique sous l’autorité de la BCE. 
Dans la gestion quotidienne, les superviseurs nationaux seront en première ligne, selon le 
principe de décentralisation qui a déjà prouvé son efficacité pour la mise en œuvre de la 
politique monétaire unique au sein de l’Eurosystème. La logique qui sous-tend ce mécanisme 
de supervision unique est le suivant : si la crise de la zone euro a été aussi violente, c’est en 
grande partie parce qu’un cercle vicieux s’est développé entre les risques bancaire et souverain. 
Pour rompre ce lien, il faut une véritable union bancaire institutionnalisée garantissant non 
seulement la même supervision partout dans la zone, mais aussi des règles identiques, un 
mécanisme intégré de résolution des crises bancaires et un régime commun de garantie des 
dépôts.  
Nous avançons vers l’union bancaire qui manquait à l’union monétaire. 
 
Compte tenu de ces éléments, il est clair que la responsabilité ultime de la sortie de crise incombe aux 
gouvernements, à titre national - pour se réformer, redresser leurs finances publiques et retrouver de la 
compétitivité – et à titre collectif, pour décider et mettre en œuvre un cadre institutionnel plus cohérent 
et complet autour de l’union monétaire. Ces réformes sont évidemment – et heureusement – le fruit 
d’un processus démocratique et ne peuvent être que cela. Mais, en contrepartie, ces réformes 
nécessaires ne peuvent pas être immédiates : elles prennent du temps, d’abord à être mises en œuvre, 
puis à produire leurs effets. Or le temps des marchés n’est pas celui de la démocratie, comme vous le 
savez. Les doutes et les retards créent de la nervosité, de la volatilité et de l’inquiétude sur les marchés 
financiers qui se traduisent souvent par des hausses importantes de taux d’intérêt pour les pays jugés 
fragiles. 
Depuis le début de la crise et de ces épisodes de tensions extrêmes et en partie injustifiées, 
l’Eurosystème a agi avec fermeté, créativité et détermination, pour ramener la confiance et la stabilité. 
 
B. La politique monétaire menée par l’Eurosystème contribue à ramener la confiance, élément clé 
pour la réussite du processus d’ajustement.  
 
1. Rappel des politiques menées par la BCE et de leurs fondements 
 
 
 
4 
 
Vous vous souvenez que la première réponse apportée aux turbulences financières à l’été 2007 est 
venue de l’Eurosystème qui a injecté plus de 90 milliards d’euros dans le système interbancaire 
européen alors menacé de gel complet. Depuis lors, l’Eurosystème a apporté des réponses concrètes et 
souvent cruciales aux différentes manifestations de la crise dans la zone euro. Il a pour cela renouvelé 
son action d’un point de vue à la fois qualitatif – en se dotant de nouveaux instruments – et quantitatif 
(la taille de son bilan a été multipliée par trois depuis le début de la crise). 
Pour ce qui est des instruments, nous avons utilisé à la fois : 
<U+F0B7> L’instrument « conventionnel » par excellence : le taux d’intérêt. La BCE mène ainsi une 
politique monétaire très accommodante depuis plusieurs années, avec actuellement des taux 
directeurs à des niveaux historiquement bas et des taux d’intérêt réels négatifs dans une grande 
partie de la zone. 
<U+F0B7> Une large palette d’instruments « non conventionnels » que l’on peut regrouper en deux 
catégories : a) les instruments visant à fournir de la liquidité (avec la politique d’appel d’offres à 
taux fixe et allocation intégrale des soumissions ; l’élargissement de la gamme des garanties 
éligibles ; l’allongement des maturités jusqu’à trois ans avec les opérations de refinancement à 
très long terme (VLTRO) et b) les instruments permettant d’intervenir directement sur les 
compartiments de marché les plus dysfonctionnels (le CBPP, le SMP).  
Ce mouvement de diversification et d’amplification des interventions de l’Eurosystème a bien sûr 
soulevé des questions sur les objectifs finaux poursuivis, les méthodes utilisées et les risques éventuels 
encourus. 
Il nous a paru essentiel, dans cette période critique, de pouvoir fonder notre action sur un socle solide, 
robuste et clairement défini. En particulier :  
<U+F0B7> Nous avons toujours agi et nous continuerons à agir dans le cadre du mandat qui nous a été 
confié par le Traité : notre objectif prioritaire est le maintien de la stabilité des prix, que nous 
avons définie comme une inflation inférieure à, mais proche de 2 % à moyen terme. Toutes les 
craintes concernant de possibles effets inflationnistes de nos politiques sont donc parfaitement 
infondées.  
<U+F0B7> Par ailleurs, nous avons toujours agi, et nous continuerons à agir, en toute indépendance des 
pouvoirs politiques. Il a toujours été parfaitement clair que les réponses aux véritables racines 
de la crise ne peuvent être apportées que par les gouvernements eux-mêmes et que la politique 
monétaire ne peut en aucun cas pallier durablement des déficiences politiques. Les craintes 
concernant le financement des États de la zone euro sont donc tout autant sans fondement. 
 
2. Focus sur les OMT 
Je voudrais pour finir faire un point plus détaillé sur la dernière mesure annoncée par la BCE : les 
opérations monétaires sur titres (Outright Monetary Transactions - OMT).  
 
 
5 
 
Pour bien comprendre la logique et la puissance de cet instrument, il faut faire un bref détour par la 
théorie de la politique monétaire.  
Vous savez que les impulsions de politique monétaire données par la banque centrale se transmettent à 
l’économie réelle par plusieurs canaux. Dans la zone euro, comme les trois quarts du financement de 
l’économie se font par l’intermédiaire du crédit bancaire, le « canal du crédit » est, de loin, le plus 
important. En temps normal, si la BCE abaisse son taux directeur, les banques voient leurs coûts de 
financement diminuer et peuvent ainsi répercuter cette baisse sur les taux des crédits qu’elles-mêmes 
proposent à leurs clients, entreprises ou ménages.  
Or, nous avons dû constater que ce canal ne fonctionnait plus correctement dans la zone euro. Nous 
avons remarqué qu’une baisse des taux directeurs se traduisait bien par une baisse du coût du crédit 
bancaire dans certaines parties de la zone, mais pas dans toutes. C’était donc l’un des fondements de 
notre politique monétaire et de son efficacité – son unicité - qui était touché. En conséquence, des 
différences de coût du crédit bancaire extrêmement importantes sont apparues d’un pays à l’autre, sans 
pour autant pouvoir s’expliquer complètement par les fondamentaux des pays concernés. Par exemple, 
deux hôtels avec les mêmes activités et les mêmes caractéristiques financières, situés de part et d’autre 
de la frontière italo-autrichienne, doivent emprunter à des taux très différents, et ce, non pas à cause 
d’une vraie différence de risque de crédit. Cette différence s’explique en réalité par le fait que certains 
compartiments des marchés financiers avaient développé des craintes quant à un possible éclatement de 
la zone euro. Ils incluaient dans les taux qu’ils offraient à certains pays une prime de risque de 
« redénomination » des obligations en monnaie nationale.  
 
Il nous est apparu extrêmement important de mettre fin à ces craintes infondées qui non seulement 
fragmentaient les marchés financiers de la zone euro mais qui, à terme, menaçaient également 
l’efficacité de notre politique monétaire. C’est dans ce but que nous avons créé les OMT qui 
consisteront en une intervention a priori illimitée sur le marché secondaire afin d’acquérir les titres 
d’État pour lesquels nous considérons que la prime de risque appliquée par les marchés est exagérément 
élevée. Les OMT constitueront donc un rempart puissant et efficace contre l’augmentation injustifiée 
des taux d’intérêt souverains et permettront ainsi de lutter contre la fragmentation des marchés de la 
zone euro et de restaurer la bonne transmission de notre politique monétaire. Nous n’utiliserons cet 
instrument que sous une conditionnalité très stricte : les États devront avoir précédemment négocié un 
programme avec le MES et tenir leurs engagements en matière de redressement budgétaire, de réformes 
financières et de compétitivité, de sorte que la confiance et la stabilité ne reviennent pas seulement à 
court et moyen terme grâce à notre action, mais aussi plus durablement.

Aujourd’hui, la zone euro avance à pas déterminés dans la bonne direction. La politique monétaire de 
l’Eurosystème est une source de confiance et de stabilité immédiates. Les gouvernements font les 
réformes budgétaires, structurelles, financières et institutionnelles qui assureront la stabilité et la 
croissance futures de la zone euro.  
Notre détermination est totale et nos efforts doivent être poursuivis sans relâche. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Paris,  le 12 décembre 2012  
 
COLLOQUE SUR LE MICROCRÉDIT ACCOMPAGNÉ  
Discours introductif de Christian Noyer,  
Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
C’est avec un grand plaisir et beaucoup d’intérêt que j’ouvre ce Colloque sur le microcrédit 
accompagné qui permettra de mieux en comprendre les principaux aspects et le rôle dans l’inclusion 
financière. Ce sujet est au cœur des préoccupations des pouvoirs publics, et au cœur de l’actualité, 
puisque vous savez certainement que le Premier Ministre a annoncé hier des mesures à venir dans ce 
domaine. Je remercie vivement les universitaires, dirigeants, représentants d’associations et de 
banques, qui ont accepté d’intervenir dans le cadre de cette manifestation. Celle-ci portera à la fois sur 
le micro crédit personnel et sur celui de nature professionnelle, dès lors que l’un comme l’autre a fait 
l’objet d’une sélection ou d’un suivi par une structure d’accompagnement.  
Comme vous le savez, la Banque de France mène une action constante, depuis plusieurs années, en 
faveur de l’accessibilité bancaire et financière. 
 1. Elle agit tout d‘abord dans le cadre de la procédure du droit au compte, qui n’a pas 
d’équivalent à notre connaissance en Europe. Le dispositif consiste à ce que la Banque de France 
désigne à toute personne physique ou morale s’étant vue refuser une ouverture de compte, une banque 
qui sera tenue de lui en ouvrir un. Des services bancaires de base y sont associés, qui permettent de 
faire concrètement fonctionner le compte. En 2011, près de 40 000 désignations, 36 700 exactement, 
sont intervenues. Le Comité consultatif du secteur financier a, en outre, organisé une concertation avec 
l’ensemble des acteurs, qui a permis de développer une gamme de paiements alternatifs aux chèques, 
au travers notamment de la carte de paiement à autorisation systématique, un moyen de paiement sûr 
pour le détenteur comme pour son banquier, et par là même un outil efficace d’inclusion financière. 
A partir de 2013, de nouveaux progrès vont être accomplis grâce à un suivi plus précis du droit au 
compte. Nous allons disposer, dans le cadre de l’Observatoire de l’épargne réglementée que j’ai 
l’honneur de présider, de données complémentaires sur la façon dont l’exercice du droit au compte est 
2 
 
concrètement mis en œuvre. Nous allons ainsi recenser le nombre de cartes de paiement à autorisation 
systématique délivrées lors de l’ouverture du droit au compte. Nous allons aussi progressivement 
mesurer, avec l’aide des établissements de crédit, ce qu’il advient du droit au compte dans l’année qui 
suit sa mise en place. 
 2. La Banque de France est également très active dans la lutte contre le surendettement. Ses 
succursales reçoivent les personnes surendettées, et préparent les dossiers qui seront présentés aux 
commissions spécialisées. Cela représente un travail considérable au service de la collectivité, qu’un 
seul chiffre suffit à illustrer : au cours de chacune des cinq dernières années, plus de 200 000 dossiers 
ont été enregistrés par les commissions de surendettement.  
Ce chiffre ne doit pas cacher le fait que le surendettement est trop souvent encore un phénomène 
partiellement répétitif : près de 40 % des dossiers sont présentés par des personnes qui avaient déjà été 
surendettées précédemment. Il faut donc aussi et surtout mettre en œuvre des mesures préventives. 
A cet égard, je considère encourageants les premiers résultats de la loi du 1er juillet 2010 relative au 
crédit à la consommation. Le comité de suivi des taux des prêts à la consommation, qui a récemment 
remis son premier rapport au gouvernement et au parlement fournit un constat clair : le crédit 
renouvelable, souvent présent dans les dossiers de surendettement, est en réduction, au bénéfice des 
prêts amortissables. De fait, ces derniers, en responsabilisant tout au long de la vie du crédit le prêteur 
comme l’emprunteur, présentent moins de risques de conduire au surendettement. Les statistiques 
nous disent d’ailleurs qu’au cours des douze derniers mois le nombre de dépôts de dossiers de 
surendettement s’est réduit de 5%, alors même que la conjoncture économique était moins favorable 
qu’auparavant.  
Je suis donc persuadé que la prévention est l’une des façons les plus efficaces de lutter contre l’excès 
d’endettement, et qu’elle mérite de ce fait d’être poursuivie.  
Mais je voudrais aussi souligner que le surendettement n’est pas uniquement d’origine financière. Il 
trouve de plus en plus sa source dans la difficulté de certains ménages à honorer les règlements de 
biens de consommation de base. Les remèdes ne doivent donc pas être cherchés exclusivement auprès 
des établissements de crédit, dont il serait injuste de leur reprocher à la fois, ou tour à tour, de prêter 
trop ou trop peu. C’est en amont, dans les causes du surendettement, que je crois aussi utile de 
chercher les remèdes. 
3. Le microcrédit accompagné compte également parmi les moyens de favoriser l’inclusion 
financière. Dès 2006, l’Observatoire de la microfinance, dont je salue la présence cet après midi de son 
président, Michel Camdessus, l’a d’ailleurs inclus dans ses réflexions et ses analyses. De fait, c’est un 
instrument particulièrement bienvenu dans notre pays, pour au moins trois raisons. 
<U+F0B7> Tout d’abord, alors que la population est très largement bancarisée –à 99%-, les ménages les 
plus modestes n’ont pas autant accès au crédit. Or, vivre sans aucun emprunt, même de 
montant très modeste est un vrai handicap pour toute une partie de la population qui a pourtant 
besoin de se transporter, de se loger et de s’équiper pour obtenir l’emploi, les revenus qui lui 
permettront ensuite de subvenir de façon autonome à ses besoins.  
<U+F0B7> Le microcrédit accompagné est aussi une forme concrète d’éducation économique et 
financière de la population, notamment de celle qui n’a pas eu la possibilité d’accéder à un 
niveau élevé d’études. Grâce aux réseaux d’accompagnement du microcrédit, qui jouent un 
rôle remarquable avec une constance et un dévouement auxquelles je rends ici hommage, des 
personnes, des ménages modestes, des apprentis chefs d’entreprise, apprennent concrètement 
3 
 
ce que signifie un prêt, un investissement utile, une trésorerie à gérer, des échéances de 
remboursement à honorer.  
<U+F0B7> Enfin, c’est un moyen certes modeste lorsqu’on considère les chiffres globaux mais 
néanmoins précieux, de préservation du tissu social et de développement de l’esprit 
d’entreprise. C’est aussi souvent une occasion bienvenue de travail en commun des 
établissements de crédit et des réseaux sociaux, leur permettant d’œuvrer ensemble à la 
réalisation des objectifs que je viens d’évoquer. 
Malgré tous ses mérites, le microcrédit accompagné est encore peu connu et reconnu. C’est pourquoi 
la Banque de France souhaite contribuer à le promouvoir.  
<U+F0B7> Tout d’abord, en assurant une meilleure visibilité de ses caractéristiques. Dans le 
prolongement des travaux du Conseil national de l’information statistique, la Banque de 
France a ainsi mis en place à compter de fin 2011, avec l’aide du Fonds de cohésion sociale, 
une collecte ambitieuse de données quantitatives. De nombreuses associations y contribuent 
d’ores et déjà, et je  mesure l’effort particulier que cela représente pour elles. Cet exercice va 
permettre à terme une connaissance complète des microcrédits, de leur objet, de leur coût et de 
leur performance. Je suis persuadé que cette information aidera significativement la réflexion 
et l’action de toutes les parties prenantes. 
<U+F0B7> J’ai aussi décidé de marquer notre soutien à cette forme particulièrement courageuse et 
responsable de financement en attribuant, chaque année à compter de l’automne 2013 deux 
prix destinés à récompenser et à reconnaître publiquement pour l’exemplarité et la qualité de 
leurs projets un particulier bénéficiaire d’un microcrédit personnel et un micro-entrepreneur 
accompagné par un microcrédit professionnel. Le choix des bénéficiaires de ces prix, d’un 
montant respectivement de 3000 et 5000 euros,  sera effectué par un comité de sélection 
comprenant des associations et des banques que j’aurai l’honneur de présider.  
Les travaux de cet après midi seront conclus par François Bourguignon, directeur de l’École 
d’économie de Paris qui nous fera le grand plaisir de faire part de ses réflexions sur ce thème, alors 
même que le modèle économique du microcrédit accompagné reste encore probablement à préciser. 
Auparavant, trois tables rondes se seront tenues pour mieux en cerner les différentes facettes. Je passe 
donc sans tarder la parole à Mme Catherine Barbaroux, présidente de l’Association du droit à 
l’initiative économique, qui a bien voulu présider la première table ronde. 
Je vous souhaite une après midi très fructueuse de travail. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Discours de Christian Noyer, gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Vœux à la Place – 21 janvier 2013 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
Je voudrais commencer en vous présentant mes vœux les meilleurs pour l’année 2013, pour vous et 
l’ensemble des collaborateurs de vos établissements.  
 
2012 a été, certes, une année difficile, mais, elle a été surtout une année fructueuse qui marquera un 
tournant dans la crise de la zone euro. Des décisions déterminantes ont été prises, apportant  des 
solutions durables pour renforcer et sécuriser le fonctionnement de notre union monétaire : la mise en 
place du MES ; le Traité sur la Stabilité, la coordination et la gouvernance ; le nouvel accord sur la 
Grèce ; et enfin, l’accord sur l’union bancaire - j’y reviendrai plus longuement.  
 
Ces avancées ont été le fruit d’un travail collectif : la BCE et l’Eurosystème ont joué un rôle décisif 
dans le retour de la confiance, notamment grâce à la création d’un nouvel outil particulièrement 
puissant : les OMT. Aujourd’hui, plus personne ne doute de la pérennité de l’Euro. Au niveau 
national, les pays ont montré qu’ils étaient capables de tout mettre en œuvre pour réduire leurs déficits 
et redresser durablement leurs finances publiques tout en engageant les réformes structurelles 
nécessaires au retour de la croissance. 
 
2013 sera, je l’espère, l’année de la consolidation et de la concrétisation de ces avancées.  
Je voudrais profiter de votre présence pour vous donner ma vision des défis qui s’annoncent cette 
année. J’en vois quatre en particulier :  
<U+F0B7> S’adapter à un environnement encore en forte évolution ;  
<U+F0B7> Poursuivre avec détermination la démarche de renforcement de la robustesse du système 
financier par la mise en œuvre et la préparation aux nouvelles réglementations ;  
<U+F0B7> Améliorer encore la compétitivité de la Place de Paris ;  
<U+F0B7> Continuer à soutenir l’économie en assurant son financement dans les meilleures conditions 
possibles. 
 
1. Un environnement réglementaire et législatif encore en forte évolution  
D’abord, vous travaillerez dans un environnement encore en forte évolution, aussi bien au regard de la 
réglementation financière internationale, que du contexte législatif français.  
 
1.1. Quelques mots sur le projet de loi bancaire en France. 
La crise financière a mis en lumière de réelles carences du dispositif international de régulation du 
secteur bancaire et financier et l’insuffisance des outils à la disposition des autorités de supervision 
pour réduire et traiter les risques.  
2 
 
Le projet de loi portant réforme bancaire et financière met en œuvre l’engagement du Président de la 
République de séparer les activités utiles au financement de l’économie des activités de marché à 
caractère spéculatif qui seront soit cantonnées, soit interdites. Il répond au besoin de renforcer la 
protection des dépôts et la sécurité des activités de marché tout en veillant - et c’est à mon sens très 
important aussi - à préserver votre capacité à offrir aux acteurs économiques une large palette de 
services financiers leur permettant de se couvrir, de se financer ou d’investir. Il en va de même pour 
les activités de tenue de marché qui jouent un rôle indispensable pour assurer la liquidité des marchés 
et donc convaincre les investisseurs de financer l’économie réelle.  
Ce sera donc une nouvelle organisation pour les banques et des pouvoirs renforcés pour l’ACP – qui 
deviendra ACPR - avec en particulier l’introduction de pouvoirs pour la résolution d’une crise 
bancaire. Dans ces circonstances exceptionnelles, l’ACP pourra mettre à contribution les actionnaires 
et les créanciers subordonnés de l’établissement en crise. Elle pourra ensuite, si nécessaire, faire 
intervenir le Fonds de garantie des dépôts et de résolution qui aujourd’hui n’est tenu d’intervenir que 
dans le cadre de sa mission d’indemnisation des déposants même si, volontairement, il a déjà participé 
à des actions de restructuration. A cet égard, comme souhaité par la Place, le projet de loi prévoit que 
la possibilité d’appel à contribution du Fonds se fera dans la limite d’un plafond fixé par décret de 
façon à assurer que l’intervention du Fonds ne provoque pas d’effet de contagion. 
 
1.2 Quelques mot sur l’union bancaire 
L’année 2012 aura été marquée par des avancées décisives dans le domaine de la supervision bancaire 
européenne. La crise que traverse la zone euro nécessitait que des mesures particulièrement 
ambitieuses soient prises ; elles le sont aujourd’hui. La détermination des dirigeants européens aura 
permis d’aboutir, en fin d’année, à un accord sur les deux projets de règlements devant instituer le 
mécanisme de supervision unique sous l’égide la BCE. Ces deux textes doivent bien sûr être 
complétés par des propositions sur la garantie des dépôts et la résolution, les deux autres piliers 
indispensables de l’union bancaire. Il reste maintenant à la BCE, et à toutes les autorités nationales 
concernées, à poursuivre les travaux préparatoires pour que le superviseur unique puisse être 
opérationnel dès que possible.  
La Banque de France et l’ACP y contribuent très largement et entendent jouer un rôle actif dans le 
nouveau dispositif. Ceci d’autant plus qu’une dizaine de groupes bancaires français feront l’objet, sur 
la base des critères fixés par le règlement, d’une supervision directe de la BCE – même si le contrôle 
au quotidien restera fait par l’ACP.  
 
2. Poursuivre avec détermination la démarche de renforcement de la robustesse du système 
financier par la mise en œuvre et la préparation aux nouvelles réglementations. Le cadre 
réglementaire financier international a encore beaucoup évolué en 2012, et il continuera à le faire en 
2013. Les efforts pour s’y conformer sont dont particulièrement importants.  
 
2-1 Le secteur des assurances doit continuer, en France et en Europe, à se préparer à 
l’application du nouveau régime prudentiel Solvabilité 2. Certes, l’année 2012 a été marquée par 
des discussions difficiles sur la directive Omnibus 2 et notamment sur la question du traitement des 
branches longues, qui n’ont pas abouti et vont conduire à un report de l’entrée en vigueur de 
Solvabilité 2. Mais un signal positif a été donné fin décembre avec l’accord conclu entre le Parlement 
Européen, le Conseil et la Commission sur les termes de référence de l’étude d’impact sur les branches 
longues. Cette étude permettra de faire avancer les discussions et je compte sur la contribution des 
organismes retenus par l’ACP.  
Le délai supplémentaire avant l’entrée en vigueur de Solvabilité 2 doit être mis à profit par les 
organismes d’assurance : en coordination avec l’EIOPA au niveau européen, nous considérons qu’il 
est d’ores et déjà possible et nécessaire de s’appuyer sur certains éléments stabilisés du dispositif 
3 
 
Solvabilité 2, notamment concernant la gouvernance et l’ORSA (pilier 2), ainsi que le reporting à 
l’autorité de contrôle (pilier 3).  
 
2-2 Dans le secteur bancaire, les établissements doivent continuer le renforcement de leur 
solvabilité, qu’ils ont bien engagé, et intensifier les actions d’adaptation à la future 
réglementation en matière de liquidité.  
La réforme « Bâle 3 » va entrer en vigueur et vous avez pu vous familiariser depuis longtemps avec les 
changements à venir dans le cadre de plusieurs réunions de place organisées par l’Autorité de Contrôle 
prudentiel. En matière de liquidité, le dispositif LCR est désormais stabilisé. Lors des vœux à la place 
en janvier 2011, je vous avais dit que les travaux menés sur les ratios de liquidité n’étaient pas 
satisfaisants et qu’il fallait remettre l’ouvrage sur le métier. C’est chose faite. Afin de contrer les 
risques récessifs sur la distribution du crédit que la première version du texte pouvait laisser craindre, 
une phase de transition à été introduite afin que les banques puissent mieux étaler leurs efforts 
d’adaptation. En outre, la calibration des exigences de liquidité a été affinée pour mieux refléter les 
expériences de la crise, tandis que la liste des actifs pouvant être détenus pour satisfaire aux exigences 
de liquidité a été élargie. Même si des ajustements sont encore possible dans le cadre de la phase 
d’observation européenne, il convient que les banques intègrent dès à présent ce nouveau standard 
dans leur politique de gestion de la liquidité. Cela veut dire que les règles du jeu étant désormais 
claires, les évolutions structurelles nécessaires doivent être engagées. 
Nous allons poursuivre nos travaux en 2013 sur le ratio à 1 an mais aussi sur les liens existants entre 
politique monétaire et ratio de liquidité.   
 
2.3 Sur le terrain de l’épargne, le mouvement de réallocation des placements financiers des ménages 
en faveur des produits d’épargne bancaire observé en 2011 s’est poursuivi en 2012. L’augmentation 
du plafond du livret A et du livret de développement durable s’est traduite aux mois d’octobre et de 
novembre par une collecte significative sur ces produits et le plafond du livret A a été une nouvelle 
fois relevé au 1er janvier. Je suis parfaitement conscient que ces évolutions de l’épargne réglementée 
créent des tensions sur la collecte tant des ressources bancaires que d’assurance-vie. Néanmoins, 
j’appelle les établissements de la Place à continuer à faire preuve de prudence et de responsabilité dans 
la recherche des ressources clientèle. La Banque de France et l’Autorité de Contrôle prudentiel y 
seront vigilantes. Il est primordial qu’il soit correctement tenu compte des conditions de marché pour 
fixer le niveau de rémunération des produits financiers, bancaires comme d’assurance-vie. Il est 
également souhaitable que la collecte de l’épargne de long terme indispensable au financement de 
l’économie soit favorisée. Sachez que je m'emploie à faire partager cet objectif par les pouvoirs 
publics. 
  
La Banque veillera à faciliter les adaptations individuelles requises par ces –nombreux ! – nouveaux 
cadres réglementaires. Nous veillerons en particulier à faciliter la gestion de la liquidité et du 
collatéral, notamment en continuant à soutenir la mobilisation des crédits à l’économie dans les 
opérations de refinancement auprès de la banque centrale mais également dans le marché. Dans cette 
perspective, sous l’impulsion de la Banque de France, un groupe de Place développe actuellement des 
mécanismes de titrisation innovants et sûrs, qui devraient permettre aux banques de mieux exploiter le 
gisement de créances privées qui figurent à leur bilan et de renforcer leurs capacités de financement. 
La Banque continuera également à mobiliser l’ensemble des acteurs concernés et en particulier les 
entreprises pour que la migration française vers les moyens de paiement SEPA, qui devra s’achever le 
1er février 2014 pour le virement et le prélèvement, s’accélère et soit un succès. Chacun pourra alors 
tirer les bénéfices en termes de coût, d’efficacité et de sécurité de ses paiements, et de la gestion de la 
liquidité associée, d’un marché désormais intégré, concurrentiel et innovant pour l’ensemble des 
paiements scripturaux en euros. 
4 
 
 
3. Améliorer l’attractivité et la compétitivité de la Place de Paris.  
La compétitivité de la Place de Paris comme centre financier constitue un atout dans la stratégie de 
sortie de crise qu’il est important de continuer à améliorer – et ce d’autant plus que l’annonce d’une 
offre de rachat de NYSE Euronext par ICE est susceptible de modifier sensiblement le jeu des acteurs 
et d’offrir de nouvelles opportunités.  
Il est essentiel que les efforts engagés pour consolider et enrichir les infrastructures et les services de 
marché et post-marché s’intensifient. L’année 2013 sera de ce point de vue marquée par une étape 
importante avec le déploiement complet de l’offre de services de compensation et de gestion tripartite 
du collatéral pour les transactions sur le marché du repo en euro, qui a été développée avec les 
principaux acteurs de la Place, banques, infrastructures de compensation et de règlement-livraison, et 
la Banque de France. Nous veillerons également à saisir les nouvelles  opportunités de développement 
qui s’ouvrent, par exemple dans les services de financement, de placement et de règlement en devises 
en cours d’internationalisation comme le renminbi et dans les infrastructures destinées à assurer une 
meilleure transparence des marchés, comme les entrepôts de données pour le marché du repo par 
exemple. 
 
4. Soutenir l’économie en assurant son financement dans les meilleures conditions possibles.  
Dernier point que je voudrais mentionner tant il est clé pour la reprise : les crédits à l’économie. La 
tendance à la baisse que nous observons depuis quelques temps est principalement due à une baisse de 
la demande. Mais il faut aussi, bien sûr, que l’offre reste suffisamment large, pour que les PME et les 
ETI, qui n’ont que rarement accès aux marchés, puissent passer la période conjoncturelle actuelle sans 
connaître des difficultés supplémentaires. Les crédits de trésorerie doivent en particulier demeurer 
suffisamment disponibles et leurs conditions d’octroi ne pas être systématiquement durcies. Or, nos 
enquêtes trimestrielles auprès de plusieurs milliers de PME mettent en exergue une diminution 
régulière du taux de pleine acceptation des demandes de crédits de trésorerie. Au dernier trimestre, le 
taux n’était que légèrement supérieur à 50 %. Le même phénomène peut être constaté, à un degré 
moindre cependant, pour les « entreprises de taille intermédiaire ». Je vous invite donc à éviter, de 
façon générale, une poursuite du fléchissement de l’offre qui aggraverait la situation des entreprises et 
rendrait plus difficile le nécessaire redressement de la conjoncture.

Mesdames, Messieurs,  
Je ne doute pas que vous aurez à cœur de relever ces défis – vous vous y êtes déjà largement préparés.  
Je vous souhaite à nouveau une très bonne année et je formule en conclusion le vœu qu’elle soit celle 
d’un système financier français toujours plus utile à l’économie, robuste, compétitif et tourné vers 
l’avenir, qui s’appuie sur une banque centrale et un superviseur vigilants et efficaces.

Association Française des Trésoriers d’Entreprise  
Paris, le 28 février 2013 
 
Discours de Robert Ophèle, second sous-gouverneur 
« Nouvelles réglementations bancaires, conséquences pour les entreprises. » 
 
Bonjour,  
Je vais évoquer ce matin quelques problématiques du financement des entreprises françaises 
au regard des évolutions réglementaires en cours dans la sphère financière. 
 
Mon point principal est le suivant : actuellement la demande de financement est limitée en 
raison de la faiblesse de l’activité économique – certains disent l’inverse : l’activité 
économique serait limitée en raison d’un manque de financement ; ce n’est pas mon analyse – 
cette demande limitée est globalement satisfaite mais lorsque cette demande augmentera à 
nouveau avec le cycle économique qui ne manquera pas de se retourner, il n’est pas certain 
que notre système bancaire puisse y faire face faute notamment de dépôts de clientèle : cela 
signifie qu’on doit se préparer soit à réintermédier des dépôts dans les bilans bancaires, soit à 
activer des canaux alternatifs de financement de marché, je pense en particulier à la titrisation, 
soit, et c’est probablement le plus sage, à faire un peu des deux. 
 
Si vous le voulez-bien, je vais d’abord faire un bref état des lieux : les entreprises françaises 
sont largement endettées mais le flux de crédits nouveaux se tarit essentiellement faute de 
demande. Dans un second temps j’évoquerai pourquoi, dans le nouveau contexte 
réglementaire et institutionnel le secteur bancaire aurait du mal à accompagner une reprise de 
la demande de crédit. Nous verrons alors comment compléter ces financements bancaires par 
des financements de marché, notamment via la titrisation. Je conclurai sur les actions 
entreprises par la Banque de France pour faciliter le financement des entreprises. 
 
D’abord un bref état des lieux. Nous observons actuellement une baisse modérée des flux de 
financement des sociétés non-financières mais une baisse rapide de leurs flux de placement ce 
qui nous amène à un flux net de financement exceptionnellement élevé. De façon assez 
2 
 
classique ces évolutions accompagnent avec un peu de retard les évolutions du PIB ; les 
placements sont les plus réactifs, les financements sont un peu plus décalés comme vous 
pouvez le voir sur ces graphiques de droite (cf. slide 1) qui rapprochent la croissance sur un 
an des flux de placement et de financement des SNF en pourcentage du PIB sur un an en 
décalant le taux de croissance de respectivement 2 et 4 trimestres. 
 
Cette baisse modérée des financements recouvre une baisse rapide des crédits compensée par 
une augmentation de l’endettement par émission de titres, les émissions d’actions restant 
symboliques (cf. slide 2). En fait, la baisse des crédits, comme la baisse des placements, est un 
indicateur quasi coïncident de la panne de croissance que traverse l’économie française. 
 
Mais il faut resituer cela dans un contexte où les entreprises françaises, comme l’ensemble de 
l’économie d’ailleurs, se caractérisent par un niveau relativement élevé d’endettement ; 
aucune des grandes catégories d’agents économiques n’est fortement endettée mais toutes le 
sont significativement. Il peut ainsi être intéressant de comparer l’économie française à 
l’économie allemande (cf. slide 3) : l’économie allemande a eu, en gros, un taux 
d’endettement stable depuis la création de la zone euro avec une tendance au désendettement 
des entreprises et surtout des ménages compensée par un endettement public croissant alors 
qu’en France tous les agents économiques ont accru leur endettement et, même si celui des 
entreprises a augmenté moins vite que celui des ménages et des APU, il représente désormais 
67 % du PIB contre 43 % pour les entreprises allemandes. 
 
Nous avons pourtant depuis plus d’un an des flux de crédit quasi nuls avec une compensation 
entre des flux de crédits à l’investissement positifs et des flux de crédit de trésorerie négatifs. 
Et ce malgré des taux d’intérêt qui sont particulièrement bas, même pour les PME, vous voyez 
sur ce graphique de droite (cf. slide 4) le taux des crédits nouveaux de moins de 1 M€ à 1/5 
ans en France, à moins de 4 %, proche des taux allemands et à un plus bas historique. 
 
En fait, les enquêtes montrent une forte baisse de la demande de crédits tant en investissement 
qu’en trésorerie alors même que les réponses des banques restent très largement positives. 
Nous avons pour établir ce diagnostic notre enquête auprès des banques et notre enquête 
auprès des entreprises ; puisque je suis ce matin à l’AFTE je vais me référer à cette seconde 
enquête  que nous conduisons chaque trimestre auprès des PME et ETI sur leur accès au 
crédit. Vous en voyez les derniers résultats (cf. slide 5) : baisse du nombre des PME 
sollicitant un crédit nouveau, acceptation presque systématique de la demande par les 
banques, mais une inflexion est observée sur les crédits de trésorerie aux PME.  
 
Je crois donc qu’il n’y a, actuellement, globalement aucun rationnement des entreprises sur 
leur accès au financement que ce soit sur les marchés pour les grandes entreprises ou via le 
crédit bancaire pour les PME et les ETI. 
 
La véritable question est en fait celle de la capacité de ces canaux, marchés ou banques, à 
répondre à la demande accrue de financement qui ne manquera pas de se manifester lorsque le 
cycle économique se renversera. La qualité de cette réponse déterminera la vigueur de la 
3 
 
reprise car c’est elle qui permettra aux entreprises d’investir, de porter le cycle de production, 
de créer des emplois et de la valeur. 
 
Or rien ne me semble acquis. J’évoquerai successivement les questions de solvabilité, de 
liquidité et de rentabilité. 
 
Je serai très bref sur la solvabilité car les banques françaises sont en très bonne position sur ce 
plan. Début 2013, la plupart des grands établissements français ont Core tier 1 supérieur à 9 % 
Full CDR4 et fin 2013 tous seront nettement au-dessus. Certes il s’agit d’un sujet qui n’est 
jamais refermé, avec aujourd’hui une mise en cause des pondérations déterminées par les 
modèles internes des établissements pour calculer les ratios de solvabilité, mais je crois que 
nos banques n’ont pas grand chose à craindre sur ce plan. Ce n’est donc pas les problèmes de 
ratio de solvabilité qui freineront la distribution des crédits aux entreprises, dès lors, et je crois 
qu’il fait le mentionner, que la rentabilité de leurs opérations et donc en fait la rentabilité de la 
banque de détail qui représente environ les deux tiers du produit net bancaire se maintiendra. 
 
La question de la liquidité est plus délicate. 
On sait que la future réglementation sur la liquidité s’articule autour d’un ratio de court terme, 
à 30 jours, et un ratio de long terme, à plus d’un an. Le premier devrait être respecté 
progressivement à compter de 2015, le second devrait entrer en vigueur en 2019. Ces ratios 
privilégient les ressources stables de la clientèle retail  or les banques françaises sont 
handicapées sur ce plan car leurs ressources « clientèle de particuliers » ont été, via les 
incitations fiscales, siphonnées par l’assurance vie d’un coté et par l’épargne réglementée, 
largement centralisée à la Caisse des Dépôts, de l’autre. L’assurance vie, qui représentait 20 
% de l’épargne financière des ménages en 1995, en représentait 37 % 15 ans plus tard alors 
que les dépôts bancaires passaient de 37 % à 30 %. Cette décrue des dépôts bancaires est 
enrayée, mais c’est l’épargne réglementée – qui représente désormais (livrets A, livrets Bleu, 
LDD et LEP) plus de 30 % du total des dépôts - qui en a bénéficié, donc, pour l’essentiel la 
Caisse des dépôts. Le mouvement, illustré sur ce graphique en bas à droite (cf. slide 6), se 
poursuivra toutes choses égales par ailleurs avec la poursuite annoncée de la hausse du 
plafond du livret A. 
 
Les ratios de liquidité vont donc être « mordants » et ce d’autant plus que la situation actuelle 
est améliorée par les modalités de conduite de la politique monétaire. Le système d’allocation 
de la liquidité en « fixed rate full allotment » et les deux opérations à 3 ans conduites il y a un 
peu plus d’un an se traduisent par un important excédent de liquidité qui améliore 
singulièrement le ratio LCR (et le ratio long NFSR)  puisque les ressources sont à plus de 
30 jours (et à plus d’un an) et que les excédents de liquidité constituent des actifs liquides 
pour ceux qui les détiennent. Mais les opérations à 3 ans tomberont mécaniquement en 2015 
et on ne peut fonder une politique sur le maintien permanent du mécanisme d’allocation 
illimitée de liquidité. 
 
Je ne m’étendrai pas à ce stade sur le ratio de long terme qui doit faire l’objet d’un réexamen 
mais il faut  avoir conscience que pour des établissements en manque de dépôt, il conduit à 
4 
 
une transformation à l’envers en obligeant à financer des crédits courts par des ressources 
échéancées longues. 
 
Quelles conséquences faut-il en tirer en termes de financement de l’économie en général et 
des entreprises en particulier ? 
 
Cela me paraît extrêmement simple dans son principe : soit le système bancaire peut 
réintermédier une part plus importante de l’épargne financière des ménages, soit les 
financements devront être portés par les établissements qui bénéficient de cette épargne, à 
savoir la Caisse des Dépôts et les organismes d’assurance vie. 
 
Et de fait, on constate une appétence forte de l’une comme des autres pour les activités de 
crédit. Je vais si vous le voulez bien revenir plus précisément sur les perspectives en matière 
de financement de crédits par les organismes d’assurance. 
En effet, si le Code des assurances autorise explicitement les entreprises d’assurance à détenir 
des prêts en représentation de leurs engagements réglementés, cette détention est strictement 
limitée, en particulier s’agissant des prêts aux entreprises,  
<U+F0B7> Seuls les prêts aux entreprises, dont les actions sont négociées sur un marché reconnu, 
ainsi qu’aux entreprises publiques sont admis largement et sans garantie particulière 
en représentation des engagements réglementés ; ils entrent dans la vaste catégorie des 
actifs qui, au total ne doit pas dépasser 65 % des engagements. 
<U+F0B7> Les parts d’organismes de titrisation ne sont, quant à eux, admis que si elles sont 
négociées sur un marché reconnu et dans la limite des actifs dont l’enveloppe globale 
est plafonnée à 5 % des engagements réglementés. 
 
Or, la notion de marché reconnue du code des assurances renvoie aux marchés réglementés 
des États de l’Espace Économique Européen ainsi qu’aux marchés des autres pays de l’OCDE 
en fonctionnement dit régulier qui ont défini des conditions de fonctionnement, d’accès au 
marché, d’admission aux négociations et qui respectent des obligations de déclaration et de 
transparence. C’est en fait une définition très restrictive pour la partie française puisqu’un 
marché comme Alternext n’est pas un marché reconnu alors même qu’il respecte les critères 
imposés aux marchés en fonctionnement régulier. 
L’achat en direct de prêts aux entreprises ne peut donc concerner que des prêts aux grandes 
entreprises, et, quant aux autres, on est conduit à passer par des FCT dont le montage 
constitue de l’évitement réglementaire avec un passage en Irlande et une cotation au 
Luxembourg qui les rend éligibles au titre de l’enveloppe de 5 %. 
 
Il est clair que si on souhaite s’engager plus avant dans cette direction, il convient de 
promouvoir des mécanismes de titrisation simples qui évitent les errements des années 2000  
et il faut également réexaminer les traitements réglementaires de la classe d’actifs prêts aux 
entreprises dans les compagnies d’assurance au sens large. 
 
Ces observations sur la notion de marché reconnu et sur la titrisation met en évidence 
l’importance que ne peut manquer de prendre le recours aux financements de marché et, ce 
5 
 
faisant, l’importance d’une bonne maîtrise de la chaîne de marché qui va du listing au 
settlement en passant par le trading et le clearing. De ce point de vue, on ne peut que se 
réjouir du maintien des activités de tenue de marché dans le périmètre de la banque 
universelle tel qu’il est prévu dans le texte de loi bancaire en discussion au Parlement – c’est 
d’ailleurs aussi le cas dans le projet de loi bancaire allemand- ; mais il est clair que le 
financement de l’économie française passera également par le maintien, voire le renforcement 
de l’influence française dans les infrastructures de marché qui traitent nos valeurs ; cela 
concerne les intermédiaires financiers mais, in fine, surtout les entreprises émettrices. 
L’avenir d’Euronext est aussi important pour le financement de notre économie que le 
maintien d’une activité de tenue de marché par des banques françaises.   
 
Nous considérons à la Banque de France que le financement des entreprises est au cœur de 
nos missions. Nous sommes donc résolument proactifs dans ce domaine. Au-delà de notre 
appareil statistique, le socle de notre intervention est constitué par notre activité de notation 
des entreprises avec une orientation résolument PME-ETI ; nous notons actuellement 
280 000 entreprises ; cette notation, qui est à l’attention exclusive de l’entreprise notée et du 
système bancaire peut être utilisée notamment pour refinancer les crédits « bien » notés ou 
pour calculer la pondération des risques au titre des ratios de solvabilité. Ce dispositif très 
granulaire permet en fait de refinancer des crédits aux entreprises de qualité moyenne puisque 
la BCE a étendu de la notation 3 à la notation 4+ ses critères d’éligibilité en 2008 puis 
accepté, début 2011, que la Banque de France refinance à ses propres risques les crédits 
associés à la notation 4, ce qui correspond en gros à une probabilité de défaut de 1 % à 
l’horizon de 1 an. Comme le montre le graphique (cf. slide 7), cette éligibilité  couvre 
actuellement, au total, 55 % des prêts aux PME. De fait, aujourd’hui dans le pool d’actifs 
mobilisables déposés par les banques à la Banque de France, les créances privées représentent 
50 % du total. Nous exerçons par ce dispositif une très forte incitation à l’octroi de crédit aux 
entreprises. 
 
Mais nous souhaitons que ce gisement d’actifs de bonne qualité soit mieux exploité et soit 
rendu plus liquide. Avec la Place de Paris,  nous menons une  réflexion sur la mise en œuvre 
d’un dispositif qui permettrait aux banques, via un véhicule de titrisation, de loger certaines 
de leurs créances privées au sein d’un instrument mobilisable dans les transactions de 
pensions bilatérales et auprès de l’Eurosystème. Les sous-jacents envisagés seraient 
exclusivement des prêts aux sociétés non financières afin d’exclure toute  « cannibalisation » 
du marché des ABS, dont les sous-jacents sont majoritairement des prêts aux ménages. La 
Banque de France serait partie prenante du dispositif puisqu’elle évaluerait les sous-jacents et 
pourrait noter les titres – des obligations non-tranchées - émis par les structures de titrisation. 
La Banque de France a simultanément entrepris des démarches auprès de l’Eurosystème afin 
de faire accepter de façon pérenne ce mécanisme qui s’apparente à un véhicule de titrisation 
de Place et d’en promouvoir l’utilisation dans les autres pays de la zone euro. En effet, les 
gisements de créances privées sont aujourd’hui sous-exploités dans de nombreux pays de la 
zone euro, pour des raisons juridiques ou opérationnelles.  
 
6 
 
Cette démarche s’inscrit, en outre, dans une volonté plus large de rendre plus liquides les prêts 
présents dans les bilans des banques. Ainsi, en parallèle, la Banque de France a initié une 
réflexion sur la possibilité d’assigner à chaque ligne de prêts, à l’instar de ce qui est pratiqué 
pour les titres négociables, l’équivalent d’un code ISIN. L’avantage d’un tel système serait 
double : il rendrait beaucoup plus simple la manipulation et la mobilisation des créances 
privées, notamment dans le cadre d’opérations de repo bilatérales ou tripartites ; il réduirait le 
risque d’une double mobilisation comme collatéral des prêts.  
 
Si nous voulons être au rendez-vous de la reprise économique, nous devons engager 
maintenant ces réformes ; la Banque de France s’y emploie avec l’ensemble des acteurs 
économiques.

Revue de la stabilité financière - Les produits dérivés de gré à gré : 
Nouvelles normes, nouveaux acteurs, nouveaux risques 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
New York - 22 avril 2013 
 
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui pour le lancement du dernier numéro de la Revue de 
la stabilité financière de la Banque de France intitulé « Les produits dérivés de gré à gré : nouvelles 
normes, nouveaux acteurs, nouveaux risques ». 
Comme vous le savez, chaque année depuis 2002, notre Revue rassemble les contributions d’éminents 
universitaires, professionnels et décideurs venant du monde entier sur un sujet d’actualité.  
Je remercie chaleureusement tous les auteurs qui nous ont permis de produire une Revue d’un grand 
intérêt grâce à leurs contributions d’une qualité et d’une densité exceptionnelles. Je ne peux pas tous 
les citer et seuls certains d'entre eux sont présents aujourd’hui ; mais vous pouvez trouver tous les 
articles dans les versions électronique et papier de la RSF, dont des exemplaires sont disponibles sur 
les tables au fond de la salle. Ces contributions sont très diverses, voire divergentes, en termes 
d’analyses et de propositions. Nous voulons qu’il en soit ainsi. Il est clair que nous ne partageons pas 
nécessairement les opinions exprimées dans les articles, mais nous croyons tous en la confrontation 
des idées. 
Pour introduire cette Revue de la stabilité financière, nous avons le grand privilège de réunir un panel 
exceptionnel :  
<U+F0B7> Un éminent législateur américain : Sénateur Dodd, je vous remercie, c’est un honneur de vous 
accueillir aujourd’hui ;  
<U+F0B7> Un régulateur de premier plan : Paul Tucker, sous-gouverneur de la Banque d’Angleterre, 
responsable de la stabilité financière. Paul, vous présidez également le Comité sur les 
systèmes de paiement et de règlement et co-présidez le Groupe de pilotage CSPR/OICV sur 
les contreparties centrales : vos idées sur le sujet sont particulièrement pointues.  
2 
 
<U+F0B7> Deux professionnels des marchés de haut niveau : Michael Bodson, président et PDG de 
DTCC, et Craig Overlander, PDG de Société Générale Americas. Vous nous donnerez une 
vision « de l’intérieur ». 
<U+F0B7> Un universitaire distingué, spécialiste notamment du risque de contrepartie et des produits 
dérivés de gré à gré : Manmohan Singh, du FMI. Merci d'être parmi nous aujourd'hui. 
Comme vous le savez, pour nos différents numéros de la RSF, nous essayons toujours de choisir des 
thèmes à la fois complexes du point de vue de l'analyse et pertinents pour la conduite actuelle de la 
politique économique. Cette édition répond parfaitement à cet objectif : la crise a conduit les dirigeants 
du G20 à prendre l’engagement de modifier les règles régissant les marchés des produits dérivés de 
gré à gré, afin de renforcer leur sécurité et leur transparence.  
Premièrement, renforcer leur sécurité : tous les produits dérivés suffisamment standardisés doivent 
faire l’objet d’une compensation obligatoire par le biais d’une contrepartie centrale afin de réduire le 
risque de contrepartie et de favoriser la liquidité de marché.  
Deuxièmement, s’agissant de la transparence, l'objectif est de parvenir à un enregistrement de toutes 
les transactions auprès des registres centraux de données afin de fournir aux autorités une vue 
d'ensemble consolidée des opérations sur produits dérivés.  
Les contributions à la RSF montrent que la plupart des engagements se sont concrétisés au travers 
d’un cadre réglementaire en cours de finalisation : en particulier, au niveau international, le Comité sur 
les systèmes de paiement et de règlement (CSPR) et l’Organisation internationale des commissions de 
valeurs (OICV) ont publié, en avril 2012, les « Principes pour les infrastructures des marchés 
financiers » qui actualisent, renforcent et étendent les normes antérieures applicables dans les 
différentes juridictions.  
Je salue tout particulièrement l’impulsion donnée par le législateur américain dans ce domaine de la 
règlementation ainsi que l’action personnelle et l’implication du Sénateur Dodd, dont la loi porte le 
nom ainsi que celui de son collègue le Sénateur Frank. La législation européenne dite EMIR 
(European Market Infrastructures Regulation) a également marqué une étape décisive pour répondre à 
la nécessité de renforcer la sécurité et la transparence sur les marchés de produits dérivés de gré à gré.  
Les contributions à la Revue de la stabilité financière montrent cependant également que les réformes 
doivent être poursuivies. 
Avant que nous n’entamions notre discussion, je souhaiterais vous livrer quelques réflexions 
personnelles sur le sujet.   
Les efforts en matière de réforme doivent être axés sur la mise en place d’un cadre réglementaire 
complet, judicieusement calibré et cohérent.  
3 
 
1. Un cadre complet s’impose.  
Cela signifie que nous devons développer et renforcer la sécurité et la transparence.  
<U+F02D> Premièrement, porter une attention particulière à la réglementation des produits dérivés de gré 
à gré qui ne feront pas l’objet d’une compensation.  
<U+F02D> Deuxièmement, porter une attention particulière à la mise en œuvre des principes pour les 
infrastructures des marchés financiers et des différentes règlementations pour garantir que les 
contreparties centrales adoptent les pratiques les plus performantes en matière de gestion du 
risque (appels de marge, collatéral, fonds de défaillance) et une gouvernance adéquate de 
nature à préserver à la fois leur propre solidité et la capacité de résilience des marchés qu’ils 
servent.  
<U+F02D> Troisièmement, définir des principes appropriés en matière de résolution et de redressement 
des infrastructures des marchés financiers, en particulier des contreparties centrales qui 
concentrent désormais un degré élevé de risques.  
<U+F02D> Enfin, assurer la transparence dans le domaine des activités de prêt interbancaire garanti et en 
blanc, qui constituent la référence pour les produits dérivés de taux d’intérêt. Les 
considérations de politique monétaire appellent également à une plus grande transparence à 
cet égard, ce domaine nécessitant une connaissance détaillée de l’organisation du marché 
monétaire et des conditions réelles dans lesquelles les opérations interviennent.  
2. Dans l’intervalle, il convient d’être très attentif à la calibration adéquate du cadre.  
L’élaboration de plusieurs réglementations concomitantes (capital, liquidité, etc.) nécessite une 
coordination parfaite. Nous ne pouvons accumuler ces différentes approches sans évaluer leur 
incidence et les coûts induits pour le marché et le public. Ce point est particulièrement préoccupant si 
l’on considère les exigences en matière de collatéral qui découlent des différentes règlementations.  
 
3. Enfin et surtout, nous devons promouvoir la mise en place d’un cadre cohérent.  
La notion de cohérence revêt plusieurs aspects : 
<U+F02D> Cohérence entre les juridictions : elle est vitale dans la mesure où la plupart des acteurs des 
marchés dérivés de gré à gré sont d’envergure mondiale : nous devons réduire au minimum les 
incitations à l’arbitrage réglementaire ; 
<U+F02D> Cohérence quant à la localisation des infrastructures de marché, en ce qui concerne les devises 
négociées : les infrastructures doivent être à la portée immédiate de la banque centrale 
concernée par le risque systémique attaché à la compensation de positions importantes dans 
une devise donnée ; 
4 
 
<U+F02D> Cohérence du point de vue des différents types d’acteurs/de contreparties : afin d’éviter de 
dériver d’une sphère réglementée à une sphère non réglementée, nous devons mettre en place 
un cadre dans lequel l’innovation financière, facteur-clé de la croissance économique, poursuit 
son développement dans la sphère réglementée en s’appuyant sur une réglementation 
appropriée du risque.  
Je ne m’attarderai pas davantage sur ces sujets d’actualité, qui vont à présent donner lieu à une 
discussion extrêmement intéressante.  
J’ai l’espoir que nous pouvons contribuer collectivement à enrichir le débat. 
Je donne à présent la parole à nos experts.

Forum Paris Europlace, 22 avril 2013 – New York 
«Croissance postcrise et opportunités d’investissement en Europe » 
 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer « La zone euro se renforce » 
  
 
 
Monsieur le Président, 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir de pouvoir m’adresser à vous ici à New York. 
J'aimerais partager avec vous quelques idées sur la zone euro dans une double perspective, de court 
terme et de long terme. 
 
Je commencerai par aborder la question de Chypre, qui a fortement marqué les esprits 
récemment. Clairement, le processus de décision n'a pas été optimal et l’effort d’ajustement exigé du 
pays, bien qu'absolument nécessaire, était totalement inattendu pour la population. En conséquence, de 
nombreux observateurs ont interprété la crise chypriote comme un signal de fragilité et d’incertitude 
quant à l’euro. 
 
En réalité, c’est exactement le contraire. Imaginez que la même situation se soit produite il y a neuf 
mois. Elle aurait alors très probablement provoqué une nouvelle vague de turbulences sur les marchés 
souverains de la zone euro, avec des hausses de taux d’intérêt et d’importantes sorties de capitaux des 
pays périphériques. Il n’en a rien été : il n’y a eu ni contagion, ni répercussions sur d’autres pays de la 
zone euro. Au premier trimestre 2013, lorsque la crise chypriote s’est produite, les taux d’intérêt à 
long terme ont diminué en Grèce, au Portugal et en Irlande, de quelque 270, 120 et 130 points de base 
respectivement. Ils ont baissé de 70 points de base en Espagne et de 30 points de base en Italie. 
C’est la première fois en trois ans qu’une crise grave touchant un pays de la zone euro n’en affecte 
pas d’autres. La conclusion qu'il faut en retirer est que la zone euro est plus robuste aujourd’hui qu’elle 
ne l’était il y a un an. Même si des défis persistent, les mesures prises ont augmenté 
notre résilience aux chocs internes et externes.  
 
Avant de vous en donner d'autres exemples, j’aimerais ajouter quelques mots concernant Chypre. 
D'abord, le soutien financier fourni par les pays de la zone euro et le FMI a été  substantiel, atteignant 
10 000 euros par citoyen chypriote. Ceci invalide les allégations de mauvais traitement ou de 
discrimination de Chypre. Ensuite, la protection des dépôts a été assurée dans la zone, et cet 
engagement ressort renforcé par les récents événements. Enfin, il faut souligner que Chypre est un cas 
unique, avec une situation d'aléa moral extrême dans laquelle de gros déposants recherchaient des 
rendements anormalement élèves auprès du système bancaire national. Cette situation exceptionnelle 
justifiait un traitement exceptionnel. Chypre ne constitue ni un précédent, ni un modèle, pour une 
future gestion de crise. Il faut affirmer avec force qu’un tel modèle bancaire n’a pas sa place dans la 
zone euro. Et qu’une telle situation n’aurait pas existé si l’union bancaire avait été en place. 
Ceci m’amène à évoquer de façon plus générale les progrès réalisés pour restaurer la robustesse et la 
cohérence de la zone euro. 
Il y a neuf mois, nous avions atteint un niveau de fragmentation du marché qui menaçait l’intégrité de 
la zone euro. Les écarts de rendement des obligations souveraines entre les pays périphériques et les 
pays du centre avaient atteint un pic historique ; les flux de capitaux privés des pays du centre vers les 
pays périphériques s’étaient taris et les conditions de financement divergeaient de plus en plus. Un 
même emprunteur était confronté à des conditions de crédit très différentes d’un pays à l’autre. 
 
Comme chacun sait, l’introduction des opérations monétaires sur titres (OMT), faisant suite aux 
déclarations du président Draghi en juillet 2012, a constitué un changement majeur. La création de cet 
outil a restauré la confiance, éliminé les risques de perte extrême et de redénomination et inversé la 
dynamique de fragmentation du marché. Le processus de rétablissement de l’intermédiation financière 
enregistre actuellement des progrès significatifs. Ces dernières semaines, les investisseurs extérieurs à 
la zone euro sont revenus sur les marchés d'actions et de dette des pays en difficulté. Les flux de 
dépôts se sont également inversés revenant des pays du centre vers ceux de la périphérie, 
où des rapatriements importants ont été réalisés par les ménages résidents. Les soldes des balances 
TARGET2, qui déterminent dans quelle mesure l’intermédiation financière compense l’insuffisance 
des flux de capitaux privés, ont diminué de 20 % depuis l’été dernier.   
 
La deuxième grande source de progrès a été l’union bancaire. Jamais au cours de son histoire l’UE 
n’avait été capable de décider et de mettre en œuvre une réforme de cette ampleur en aussi peu de 
temps. Il y a un an, le sujet n’était même pas sur la table. En juin dernier, les responsables européens 
ont fait un premier pas décisif puis, après des jours et des nuits de travail acharné et 
de rudes négociations, un accord détaillé a finalement été conclu en décembre. 
 
Nous ne saurions trop insister sur les bénéfices qu’apportera l’union bancaire. Elle mettra fin au lien 
entre les États et leurs banques. Elle mettra fin à ces interactions négatives qui ont des effets 
extrêmement pervers en périodes de tensions. Elle garantira que les conditions de crédit dans la zone 
euro ne dépendent pas de la nationalité de l'emprunteur mais de la qualité de sa 
signature, soit précisément ce que chacun est en droit d’attendre d’un marché financier efficient. 
 
La structure de gouvernance que nous avons adoptée garantira - alors même que le Conseil des 
gouverneurs conserve bien le pouvoir de décision - qu'il n’y aura pas de conflit d’intérêt entre la 
politique monétaire et la supervision bancaire. Par ailleurs, une surveillance plus homogène 
dans l’ensemble de la zone euro devrait permettre la détection précoce de risques et de déséquilibres 
potentiels et, au final, améliorer la transmission de la politique monétaire.   
 
Actuellement, le premier pilier de l’union bancaire, le mécanisme de surveillance unique, est en cours 
d’édification. Il s’agit là d’une première étape fondamentale et sa mise en œuvre rapide sera une 
avancée majeure pour la zone euro. 
Pourtant, à lui seul, il ne permettra pas de réaliser tous les objectifs de l'union bancaire. Nous devons 
donc construire rapidement ses deux autres piliers : une autorité supranationale de résolution des 
défaillances bancaires (la Commission européenne doit présenter un projet à cet égard avant l’été) et 
un système unifié de garantie des dépôts. 
 
Naturellement, la situation actuelle présente des points négatifs. Une préoccupation majeure est la 
stagnation du crédit bancaire, qui affecte tout particulièrement les PME. Dans l’ensemble, 
l’amélioration de la situation de financement des banques ne s’est pas traduite par une augmentation 
des prêts consentis au secteur privé non financier, qui ont diminué au cours des derniers mois. 
Certes, cette situation s’explique en partie par la faiblesse de la demande de crédit. Là encore, une 
fragmentation peut être observée. Selon les pays : la distribution du crédit est plus dynamique en 
Allemagne ou en France qu’en Italie ou en Espagne. Et selon les emprunteurs, les grandes entreprises 
pouvant émettre à des taux très favorables alors que dans le même temps, les PME sont privées d’un 
financement indispensable. Cette divergence est une source d’inquiétude, notamment parce que, dans 
nos économies, les PME jouent un rôle prépondérant pour favoriser l’innovation et l’emploi. 
 
Cette situation ne traduit pas nécessairement une faiblesse spécifique à la zone euro. Dans toutes les 
économies avancées, les banques sont engagées dans un processus de redressement de leur bilan et de 
désendettement. Des chiffres récents montrent les avancées majeures des banques européennes dans le 
renforcement de leur capital, en ligne avec les exigences de Bâle III et, en particulier pour les grandes 
banques internationales, en ligne avec ce qui se passe aux États-Unis. Mais il faut garder à l'esprit que, 
dans la zone euro, les banques assurent 80 % du financement total, soit le double des États-Unis. Par 
conséquent, l’impact est nettement plus important sur l’économie réelle. 
Que peuvent faire les banques centrales ? Notre action est guidée par les éléments suivants. Il est clair 
que l’inflation est fermement maîtrisée. Les taux directeurs sont très bas. Dans les faits, la plupart des 
banques centrales pratiquent actuellement des taux proches de zéro. Par conséquent, leur action, dans 
toutes les économies avancées, vise essentiellement à s’assurer que l’impact de leurs décisions se fait 
sentir sur tous les compartiments de l’économie. En d’autres termes, leur objectif est de garantir que le 
mécanisme de transmission de la politique monétaire fonctionne. 
  
Venons-en maintenant à la politique budgétaire. Dans toutes les économies avancées, et surtout aux 
États-Unis, l’orientation budgétaire fait l’objet de débats très vifs. Comme nous le savons tous depuis 
que Musgrave a introduit sa célèbre distinction, la politique budgétaire a trois grandes fonctions : 
stabilisation, allocation des ressources et redistribution. Dans un environnement d'après-
crise, les gouvernements s’efforcent de trouver le juste dosage. Aujourd’hui, qu’est-ce qui constitue 
une politique budgétaire propice à la croissance ? La discussion s’est quelquefois focalisée sur l’aspect 
stabilisation, et plus spécifiquement, sur une caractéristique importante, mais limitée : les 
« multiplicateurs budgétaires » qui visent à déterminer l’incidence sur le PIB d’une variation du solde 
budgétaire. Ce point de vue restrictif insiste sur les aspects négatifs de l’assainissement budgétaire, 
notamment lorsque l’écart de production est fortement négatif, comme c'est le cas actuellement.  
 
Cependant, nous devons nous placer dans une perspective plus large et prendre en considération 
l'incidence de la politique budgétaire sur la confiance des consommateurs et des investisseurs ainsi que 
sur l’allocation efficiente des ressources. D’où peuvent provenir les gains ? Pour répondre à cette 
question, il est important d’examiner les interactions entre l’orientation budgétaire et les marchés de la 
dette. À l’évidence, une stratégie propice à la croissance doit réduire au maximum les risques de chocs 
financiers majeurs à l’avenir, ne pas entraver le bon fonctionnement de l’intermédiation financière et 
ne pas bloquer la transmission de la politique monétaire. Dans de nombreux pays de la zone euro, les 
rendements des obligations souveraines se situent encore à des niveaux pénalisants. Dans les pays 
du « cœur » de la zone euro, dont la France, la situation est différente avec des taux d’intérêt 
historiquement bas. Dans certains cas, cette situation reflète l’assainissement budgétaire réalisé, mais 
d’autres facteurs temporaires sont également à l’œuvre, comme la faiblesse des perspectives de 
croissance à court terme et les conditions monétaires et de liquidité exceptionnellement 
accommodantes à l’échelle mondiale. Cet environnement offre une opportunité unique pour ramener la 
dette publique à un niveau plus approprié. 
 
La croissance de la zone euro dépendra, en dernière analyse, de sa capacité à entreprendre les réformes 
structurelles indispensables et à améliorer la compétitivité. La zone euro, comme toutes les économies 
avancées, est confrontée à un double défi. Premièrement, elle doit absorber les conséquences de la 
crise, résorber les déséquilibres financiers, éliminer l’excès d’endettement et rétablir le fonctionnement 
normal des marchés de capitaux. Et deuxièmement, elle doit s’adapter aux profondes mutations de 
l’économie mondiale. Au delà des difficultés actuelles, il est clair que la zone euro est bien armée pour 
faire face aux défis du 21
e
 siècle. Avec 370 millions de consommateurs et un pouvoir d’achat élevé, 
elle reste le plus grand marché du monde. Elle est également la zone économique la plus intégrée, avec 
une main-d’œuvre hautement qualifiée et des infrastructures de qualité. Trop souvent, toutefois, les 
pays de la zone euro ne tirent pas les avantages que leur procure leur position à cause des rigidités 
accumulées au fil du temps, pendant les périodes de croissance facile. Aujourd’hui, l’environnement 
international est plus difficile : de nouveaux concurrents puissants sont apparus et les avantages 
comparatifs ont été modifiés. Il n’y a pas d’alternative à l’ajustement. 
 
La crise a déjà entraîné d’importantes réformes dans de nombreux pays, avec la réduction de la 
taille du secteur public, des modifications de la réglementation du travail et une concurrence plus forte 
sur les marchés de biens. On observe une amélioration significative de la compétitivité-prix mesurée 
par les coûts unitaires du travail (CUT) : entre 2008 et 2012, dans les trois pays sous programme (la 
Grèce, le Portugal et l’Irlande), la croissance cumulée des CUT a été inférieure de quelque 12 points 
de pourcentage à la moyenne de la zone euro, grâce à des baisses de salaire, à des gains de productivité 
ou aux deux. Les soldes des transactions courantes affichent également une forte correction. Dans les 
trois pays sous programme, ils se sont redressés de plus de 9 points de pourcentage du PIB entre 2008 
et 2012. En Espagne, le déficit courant s’est amélioré de plus de 7 points de pourcentage sur la même 
période. L’ajustement est attribuable, pour partie, à une contraction de la demande 
intérieure.Toutefois, en Irlande, en Espagne et au Portugal, les performances à l’exportation ont été 
très solides par rapport à la période antérieure à la crise. Au total, l’excédent commercial de la zone 
euro a dépassé 1 % du PIB en 2012 contre un résultat proche de zéro les années précédentes. Cet 
excédent devrait persister au cours des prochaines années. 
 
En France, les gouvernements successifs ont réformé les régimes de retraite, introduit des mesures 
pour réduire les coûts du travail (le pacte de compétitivité) et accru la flexibilité du marché du 
travail. Il s’agit là des premières étapes d’un effort continu de redressement de la compétitivité et de 
reconstruction d’une base d’exportations. Ces mesures doivent être poursuivies et amplifiées. 
 
Permettez-moi maintenant de conclure. Les trois dernières années ont été les plus difficiles pour 
l’Europe depuis la création de l’Union européenne. Il est certainement trop tôt pour dire que la crise 
est terminée. Cependant, les tendances actuelles sont positives et la zone euro paraît beaucoup plus 
solide aujourd’hui qu’il y a un an. Les projections actuelles vont dans le sens d’un retour à une 
croissance positive au second semestre 2013 et en 2014. De nombreux signes indiquent que les efforts 
entrepris ces deux dernières années portent leurs fruits. D’importantes modifications ont été apportées 
à la gouvernance de la zone euro, concernant à la fois le renforcement des cadres budgétaires et 
l’amélioration des mécanismes de gestion des crises. Beaucoup reste encore à faire. Mais si 
nous tenons le cap, nous sortirons de la crise mieux armés pour tirer profit des opportunités offertes 
par notre monnaie unique.

Remise du Prix du Meilleur Article Financier 
Discours de Christian Noyer 
 
18 juin 2013 
------------ 
Mesdames, Messieurs les membres du jury, 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
Chers amis, 
 
C’est un grand plaisir pour moi d’être présent parmi vous pour conclure 
cette remise du Prix du meilleur article Financier 2013. 
 
De manière paradoxale la finance n’a pas toujours bonne presse et nous remettons 
ce jour le prix du meilleur article financier.  
 
(La succession  historique de crises financières dans la période  récente justifie en 
partie cette méfiance. Cette crise a été causée par des excès et des dérives dans le 
monde de la banque et de la finance. Nous faisons en sorte que cela ne 
recommence pas. C’est pourquoi, avec le gouvernement et avec nos homologues 
étrangers, nous travaillons à réformer et renforcer la réglementation et le contrôle 
des activités financière à contingenter les activités spéculatives, à lutter contre le 
blanchiment des capitaux. Mais nous avons aussi besoin de la « bonne » finance, 
celle qui permet de créer, d’entreprendre, d’acquérir son logement, de s’assurer 
contre les risques de la vie, de financer les entreprises.) 
 
 
Ce prix fait œuvre utile. Toutes les enquêtes d’opinion le confirment : économie et 
finance restent pour les Français terra incognita.  Je rappelle ici les résultats d’un 
sondage TNS Sofres réalisé il y a six mois pour la Banque de France : Les Français 
se jugent insuffisamment formés en économie 91% des Français jugent le niveau de 
connaissances de leurs concitoyens de moyen à faible. 
Si un peu plus du tiers des Français (37%) est d’accord avec l’affirmation selon 
laquelle « l’information économique est compréhensible », 60% ne souscrivent pas à 
cette affirmation.  
C’était donc pour les auteurs appelés ici ce soir un  défi – et il a été remporté - que 
de rendre compréhensible les CDS, les manipulations de LIBOR, les anticipations 
ricardiennes ou de rendre limpide les enchainements des crises récentes par le 
grand public. 
 
Contribuer à démystifier les notions et les mécanismes financiers et in fine éclairer 
les Français sur ces matières mais également sur les risques et dérives de la 
finance, c’est une condition nécessaire pour une société qui veut s’inscrire dans un 
environnement mondialisé    
 
En matière financière, plus que dans d’autres domaines, le journaliste est confronté à 
de multiples contraintes : la complexité des sujets qui ne font pas, loin sans faut, 
l’objet d’un consensus entre experts, l’exigence d’un décryptage simple d’une 
actualité complexe, mais aussi la nécessaire brièveté dans l’espace accordé par les 
rédactions en chef. Vos articles sont donc l’objet d’arbitrages et de maximisation 
sous contraintes qui soulignent la difficulté de votre tâche.  
Grâce à vos articles, vos lecteurs seront des citoyens mieux informés éclairés et des 
agents économiques peut-être plus efficients, mieux à même de prendre des 
décisions. L’information économique joue j’en suis convaincu un rôle clef et les 
journalistes économiques et financiers ont à cet égard une vraie responsabilité. 
 
Le jury s’est attaché à sélectionner et à récompenser des articles de fond avec un 
recul indispensable à l’analyse et à primer des articles pour leurs qualités 
pédagogiques. Je partage entièrement son choix. Les livraisons ont été cette année 
d’excellent niveau, les articles sélectionnés sont rigoureux sur le fond et la forme, 
attractifs et originaux. Vos articles méritaient largement un AAA. 
 
La participation de la Banque de France au prix du meilleur article financier marque 
notre volonté et notre engagement de contribuer à diffuser la culture économique et 
financière auprès du grand public et à permettre aux lecteurs d’avoir une meilleure 
compréhension de la sphère financière souvent mal aimée mais surtout objet de 
perplexité . Nous aurions pu vous recevoir dans le cadre de l’exposition « L’économie 
krach, boum, mue ? » que nous coproduisons à la Cité des Sciences, mais les lieux 
s’y prêtaient moins que cet auditorium. Je compte bien vous accueillir dans deux ans 
à la Cité de l’économie et de la Monnaie ! 
 
Je me réjouis pour la Banque de France qu’elle parraine ce prix et je me félicite de ce 
que vous continuerez à éclairer vos lecteurs, ce dont tout citoyen peut se féliciter.

Rencontres économiques d’Aix-en-Provence – 6 juillet 2013 
Session 5 – « La fin de la dictature de la finance ? » 
Introduction de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
1. D’abord y-a-t-il véritablement une dictature de la finance ?  
Cette question n’est pas nouvelle : déjà Pétrone, à Rome, au tout début de notre ère, posait cette 
question : « Que peuvent les lois là où l’argent est roi ? ».  
L’on sent dans cette question désabusée qui semble porter sa réponse l’inquiétude de l’écrivain latin 
(né d’ailleurs dans la ville voisine de Marseille) face à la difficulté d’imposer le primat du pouvoir 
politique sur le pouvoir financier. 
i) La finance a incontestablement des pouvoirs très importants : 
 Un pouvoir créateur, de soutien au développement économique. Dans ses formes les plus 
traditionnelles, c’est bien son rôle – et son pouvoir – le plus crucial : elle est un rouage 
essentiel de l’activité économique car elle alloue les capitaux, elle fournit du crédit, elle 
permet de gérer le risque. Plus encore que « le nerf de la guerre », elle est un peu le sang qui 
circule dans notre corps et alimente nos organes.  
 
 Un pouvoir destructeur très fort également : ce sont bien les dérives d’une sophistication 
incontrôlée de la finance qui sont à l’origine de la crise financière de 2007-2008, crise 
financière qui s’est ensuite transformée en crise économique, sociale, et politique. Des pertes 
limitées sur les subprimes ont finalement abouti à la destruction de millions d’emplois de par 
le monde : le lien entre la finance et l’économie réelle est alors apparu cruellement concret.   
 
ii) Mais il n’y a certainement pas de « toute puissance » de la finance : le pouvoir politique de la 
finance n’est, à mon sens, que celui que les États lui donnent. 
 Bien sûr, la pression des marchés financiers a accentué les difficultés de certains États, dans la 
zone euro notamment –repensez aux attaques contre la dette italienne à l’été 2011-. Mais si les 
marchés ont été capables d’exercer cette pression, c’est bien parce que les États s’étaient, en 
2 
 
quelque sorte, « remis entre leurs mains » en leur demandant de financer l’accumulation de 
leurs déficits, y compris durant les périodes de croissance.  
 
 Dans la plupart des épisodes de crise de la zone euro depuis 2009, les marchés ont eu des 
réactions souvent brutales et extrêmes, c’est vrai. Mais ces réactions reposaient souvent sur 
des inquiétudes bien fondées : la non-soutenabilité de la dette grecque, les failles dans le 
dispositif institutionnel de l’union monétaire, la divergence de compétitivité au sein de la zone 
euro, par exemple. Ici encore, c’est parce que les États n’ont pas fait les efforts nécessaires (de 
discipline budgétaire, de maintien de la compétitivité, de finalisation institutionnelle de 
l’Europe financière par exemple) qu’ils se sont mis en situation d’être pressés voire 
pressurés par les marchés et de subir leurs sur-réactions.  
 
La finance ne devrait servir ni d’alibi, ni de bouc-émissaire aux gouvernements qui, bien au contraire, 
doivent par leur discipline de gestion réaffirmer leur ascendant sur elle.  
 
2. La finance ne doit pas asservir l’économie ; elle doit la servir. 
i) Réaffirmer l’importance de la régulation et de la supervision : 
 La période des années 1990 au début des années 2000, qu’on appelle parfois la « Grande 
Modération » parce que l’inflation y était stable et modérée et la croissance apparemment 
solide et soutenable a en réalité souvent été aussi une période d’empilement d’excès 
financiers. Ces excès ont conduit à la crise et ont largement pris racine dans le dogme de 
l’autorégulation – dogme qui, lui-même, était nourri par une certaine sacralisation des marchés 
financiers considérés comme « efficients » par nature et capables de former les « vrais » prix-.  
 
 La crise a violemment invalidé cette thèse. L’opacité de certains segments des marchés 
financiers – les CDO notamment – a largement amplifié la perte de confiance dès les 
premières étincelles de la crise. L’insuffisance des coussins de capital de nombreuses 
institutions financières les a empêché d’amortir les chocs, a entraîné des faillites ou  a obligé 
les États à venir à leur secours, opération d’abord extrêmement coûteuse pour les finances 
publiques mais aussi très préjudiciable en termes de responsabilisation des acteurs financiers 
puisqu’elle a parfois consisté à « socialiser » des pertes, alors que les profits avaient 
auparavant été « privatisés ». C’est toute la problématique de l’aléa moral  qui sera sans doute 
évoquée au cours de cette session.  
 
 Les faits ont donc violemment rappelé que l’autorégulation « ça ne marche pas », notamment 
à cause des imperfections de certains marchés financiers qui ne sont ni transparents ni 
efficients (le marché des CDS par exemple) et produisent des externalités négatives 
potentiellement immenses. La régulation et la supervision ont donc retrouvé leur place après la 
crise – place qu’elles n’auraient jamais dû perdre. Par parenthèse, je remarque que la crise a 
débuté aux États-Unis du fait d’entités non-régulées (les conduits) ou de banques qui 
n’appliquaient pas Bâle 2 (investment banks théoriquement régulées par la SEC), alors que les 
banques françaises par exemple, dont la supervision a parfois été qualifiée d’ « intrusive » ont, 
dans l’ensemble, plutôt bien traversé les différents épisodes de crise.  
 
ii) Quelles règles pour la finance ? 
 Une fois le constat posé qu’il fallait renforcer la régulation et la supervision financières, la 
question suivante était bien sûr : quelle régulation ?  
3 
 
 Le principe qui a guidé les régulateurs, notamment dans le cadre du comité de Bâle, a été de 
remettre la finance au service de l’économie : que la finance serve l’économie, et non qu’elle 
la gouverne.  
 
 Plus précisément, cinq grands objectifs ont guidé les nouvelles réglementations :  
i) Renforcer la résilience des banques (ratios de solvabilité et de liquidité) ; 
ii) Prévenir les excès de levier et de transformation (ratios de levier et de liquidité à long 
terme) ; 
iii) Réduire les risques de marché et leur opacité (réforme des dérivés de gré à gré, Bâle 
2.5 sur les risques de marché) ; 
iv) Limiter les risques systémiques (règles macroprudentielles, identification et règles 
particulières pour les institutions à caractère systémique, règles de résolution) ; 
v) Lutter contre la « finance-casino » (règles de séparation de certaines activités 
bancaires spéculatives).  
 
 Dans tout le processus de préparation des nouvelles règles, l’idée n’a jamais été d’étouffer les 
banques par des règles inutilement contraignantes. Les régulateurs ont essayé de calibrer les 
règles de manière équilibrée et ont pris en compte la réalité de la situation des institutions – et 
le risque que les règles ne conduisent pas à une limitation des activités bancaires dangereuses 
mais à un déplacement de ces activités des banques vers les entités non-régulées-. La France, 
en particulier, s’est employée à ne pas laisser la « loi du pendule » fixer le curseur de la 
réglementation à un niveau incompatible avec une activité bancaire capable de poursuivre le 
financement de l’économie. Je pense à deux exemples en particulier : l’amélioration du ratio 
court de liquidité (LCR) en début d’année et les choix équilibrés faits par les autorités 
politiques françaises et allemandes en termes de séparation des activités bancaires.  
 
 L’idée n’a jamais été non plus d’interdire l’innovation financière. Vous connaissez 
probablement le mot de l’ancien Président de la Fed Paul Volcker : « la seule innovation 
financière qui selon moi ait jamais servi l’économie, c’est le distributeur automatique de 
billets ». Je ne partage pas complètement cet avis (son auteur non plus sans doute, c’est une 
boutade) et je pense que, comme dans les autres industries, l’innovation et la compétitivité 
doivent être encouragées dans l’industrie financière. Depuis les marchés dérivés de matières 
premières créés à Chicago, l’innovation sur les marchés a le plus souvent servi l’économie 
réelle en permettant notamment aux entreprises du secteur réel de mieux gérer leurs risques. 
Mais compte tenu du potentiel de nuisances des excès de cette industrie sur toute l’économie, 
plus qu’ailleurs, l’innovation doit y être contrôlée.   
 
 Au total, beaucoup a déjà été fait, depuis 2009, pour mieux contrôler la finance, faire en sorte 
qu’elle remplisse ses fonctions cruciales au service de l’économie, sans la déstabiliser. Mais 
de nombreux travaux en cours doivent encore aboutir. Je pense en particulier aux travaux dans 
les secteurs sur lesquels les régulateurs ont une prise moindre que sur les banques : le shadow 
banking, les hedge funds, les paradis fiscaux, ou plutôt les paradis réglementaires. Je suis 
certain que les discussions de cette session permettront de donner des pistes.

Dîner du think tank Etienne Marcel 
« Les banques ont-elles encore un rôle à jouer  
dans le financement des entreprises ? » 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Salons du Sénat – Lundi 23 septembre 2013 
 
 
Monsieur le Président,  
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
Je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous ce soir pour parler d’un sujet crucial pour la croissance 
économique de notre pays et qui est au cœur de nombreuses préoccupations de la Banque de France : 
le financement des entreprises, et plus particulièrement des PME puisque votre think tank leur est 
consacré.  
 
A titre liminaire, je voudrais rapidement vous donner quelques éléments de contexte et éventuellement 
lancer certaines pistes qui pourront être reprises dans la discussion. Je serai alors évidemment à votre 
disposition pour répondre à toutes vos questions et débattre ensemble.  
 
 
1. Pour commencer, une réponse simple à votre question : oui, les banques jouent encore un rôle 
considérable dans le financement des entreprises : 
<U+F0B7> Elles couvrent aujourd’hui encore 64% des besoins en financement des entreprises, soit 
environ 820 milliards€, contre 36% pour les financements de marché ;  
 
<U+F0B7> Bien sûr, ce chiffre est en baisse depuis le début de la crise financière : en 2008, les crédits 
bancaires représentaient 73% du financement des entreprises contre 27% au marché ;  
 
<U+F0B7> Mais cette diminution est essentiellement le fait des grandes entreprises qui peuvent avoir et 
ont massivement eu recours à des émissions de titres sur le marché (+7.7% en 2011 ; +12.5% 
en 2012) ;  
 
<U+F0B7> Cette substitution a une explication très simple : les coûts de financement sur le marché sont 
inférieurs aux coûts du crédit bancaire depuis 2011, notamment du fait de la baisse des taux 
d’intérêt de la BCE à des niveaux historiquement bas qui se répercute plus directement sur les 
taux de marché que sur les taux des crédits (en moyenne mensuelle, les coûts de financement 
pour les entreprises françaises étaient en juillet de 2.7% en intermédié contre 2.2% sur le 
marché);  
 
<U+F0B7> Les tout derniers chiffres de juillet 2013 confirment cette tendance : alors que l’encours de 
crédits mobilisés par les grandes entreprises est en repli de 10.3% par rapport à juillet 2012, 
l’encours de crédits mobilisés par les PME croît de 0.4% par rapport à l’année dernière.  
 
2. Bien que le crédit aux PME ait continué de croître depuis la crise, il y a indéniablement eu une 
forte décélération, en particulier depuis un an, qui explique en partie votre inquiétude : 
<U+F0B7> Or, ce que l’on constate à la Banque de France, c’est que ce phénomène n’est pas dû à un repli 
de l’offre de crédits bancaires : 
- les critères d’octroi ne se sont pas significativement resserrés pour les PME et les demandes 
de crédit sont très largement satisfaites (84% des PME  ont obtenu en totalité ou au moins aux 
¾ le crédit demandé au T2 2013) ;  
- les taux ont largement baissé (d’un pic à 6% en moyenne à mi-2008 à moins de 3% 
aujourd’hui) ;  
 
<U+F0B7> Le repli (faible, j’insiste, notamment par rapport à tous nos voisins européens) des crédits aux 
PME est en réalité essentiellement imputable à une baisse de la demande, elle-même résultant 
d’un contexte économique baissier et marqué par l’incertitude. Nous voyons récemment cette 
demande remonter légèrement, accompagnant les nouvelles plutôt positives sur l’état de notre 
économie ;  
 
<U+F0B7> Un seul secteur a montré un resserrement de l’offre qui a attiré notre attention : ce sont les 
crédits de trésorerie, dont le taux d’obtention par les PME avait baissé jusqu’à 63% au dernier 
trimestre 2012. Il est depuis remonté à 72%, mais nous continuons à rester vigilants sur ce 
point.  
 
3. Je crois aussi que les craintes concernant la pérennité du financement intermédié des PME sont 
liées au nouveau contexte réglementaire. Sur ce point, je crois être en mesure de pouvoir vous 
rassurer quelque peu, même si des efforts seront encore nécessaires :  
<U+F0B7> Le Comité de Bâle a tenu compte des conséquences potentiellement néfastes pour le 
financement des entreprises de ces nouveaux ratios de solvabilité et de liquidité :  
- le calibrage des dispositifs en matière de solvabilité a été revu de façon à corriger certaines 
règles sur les charges en capital et les lignes de liquidité qui pénalisaient les entreprises. Les 
banques françaises sont parvenues à se mettre au niveau de ces nouvelles exigences de 
solvabilité sans impact notable sur le crédit bancaire ;  
- le ratio de liquidité a également été revu en profondeur en début d’année pour limiter les 
effets contre-productifs sur le financement de l’économie. La situation pour les banques 
françaises est moins confortable sur ce point : leurs ratios de liquidité sont relativement bons 
mais dépendants de conditions de politique monétaire très accommodantes et qui n’ont pas 
vocation à durer éternellement. En outre, les banques françaises restent structurellement 
désavantagées en termes de liquidité par le trio OPCVM/assurance-vie/épargne réglementée.  
 
4. Pour s’assurer qu’une reprise de l’économie française puisse être soutenue par un 
financement adéquat des entreprises, plusieurs pistes me semblent importantes à creuser :  
<U+F0B7> Il faut maintenir nos efforts pour faire en sorte que les nouvelles normes réglementaires 
n’aient pas d’impact sur le financement intermédié et, plus spécifiquement, poursuivre nos 
actions pour éviter des tensions sur la liquidité des banques française (un point sera fait à 
l’automne sur l’impact de la réforme de l’épargne réglementée, notamment sur la mise à 
disposition des banques d’une partie des fonds centralisés) ;  
 
<U+F0B7> La situation requiert, dans ce domaine comme dans beaucoup d’autres, de la créativité et de 
l’audace.  
Je veux citer ici le projet de Place, porté par la Banque de France, de collatéralisation des 
créances privées dont vous avez probablement déjà entendu parler.  
L’idée est assez simple, elle consiste à exploiter les gisements importants de créances privées 
de bonne qualité qui ne le sont pas aujourd’hui. Les banques qui le souhaiteront, pourront, via 
un véhicule de Place, adosser ces créances à une obligation, elle-même négociable et 
permettant aux banques de lever des ressources à moyen/long terme. Nous faisons en outre en 
sorte que ces obligations puissent être mobilisables, sous réserve bien sûr de remplir les 
conditions d’éligibilité, en tant que collatéral pour le refinancement Eurosystème.  
Ce système aura le double avantage de permettre aux banques de diversifier leurs sources de 
financement et d’encourager l’activité de crédit aux PME. Les travaux avec la Place ont déjà 
bien avancé et nous espérons qu’une première émission pourra avoir lieu avant la fin de 
l’année.  
La Banque de France a été à l’origine de ce projet et sera partie prenante au dispositif puisque 
nous fournirons les informations sur la qualité des créances qui garantiront les obligations 
grâce à notre cotation (je rappelle que nous notons plus de 280 000 entreprises en France, dont 
une large majorité de PME).  
 
<U+F0B7> Je rappelle également que la Médiation du Crédit (Jeanne-Marie PROST est présente), qui a 
été mise en place en 2008 et qui s’appuie sur la Banque de France, est toujours un recours 
possible pour les entreprises qui auraient des difficultés de financement.  
 
<U+F0B7> D’autres initiatives récentes méritent d’être saluées je crois, comme la mise en place de 
placements privés en France (« EuroPP »), à l’image du Schuldschein allemand, qui donnent 
une nouvelle option de financement – plutôt aux ETI non-cotées cependant – et qui connu un 
essor assez rapide (5Mds depuis son lancement en 2012), ou encore le lancement du PEA-
PME.  
 
5. Je m’arrête là pour mon propos introductif. J’espère avoir donné des pistes de réponse ou de 
réflexion à vos inquiétudes sur la pérennité du financement intermédié des entreprises françaises. Je 
crois que la crise a effectivement provoqué des changements, dont certains seront durables, mais je 
crois aussi que nous avons les moyens de trouver des solutions pour nous y adapter.  
 
Je vous remercie pour votre attention et suis à votre disposition pour vos remarques ou questions.

Europlace International Forum 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Pékin, 26 novembre 2013 
 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
Je suis très heureux de pouvoir m’exprimer ici aujourd’hui. Je tiens à remercier et à féliciter 
toute l’équipe de Paris Europlace pour l’organisation de ce Forum qui est chaque année une 
précieuse occasion de dialogue direct avec les responsables économiques et financiers et 
les investisseurs asiatiques.  
 
Avant d’échanger directement avec vous, je voudrais centrer mon introduction sur les trois 
thèmes suivants :  
 
<U+F0B7> L’avancement de la reprise en zone euro ;  
<U+F0B7> Les progrès de l’union bancaire européenne ;  
<U+F0B7> La stratégie de politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème. 
 
Ces trois sujets sont indissociables pour analyser la zone euro actuellement et pour 
comprendre le chemin qu’elle est en train de prendre vers une croissance solide et durable.  
********* 
 
Tout d’abord, permettez-moi de m’appuyer sur quelques chiffres pour éclairer la situation 
économique et financière actuelle de la zone euro :  
 
• Le deuxième trimestre 2013 a marqué la fin d’une période de six trimestres de 
récession. La zone euro a ainsi renoué avec une croissance positive de 0,3 % par 
2/5 
rapport au trimestre précédent. L’amélioration est certes modeste, mais elle est 
indiscutable et traduit une dynamique globalement bien meilleure et, malgré la 
volatilité et la fragilité persistante de cette reprise, elle a été confirmée par une 
croissance de 0,1 % au troisième trimestre ;  
• Depuis quelques mois, les indices PMI sont repassés au-dessus de leur moyenne de 
long terme dans la zone euro, confirmant un rebond de l’activité économique. En 
octobre par exemple, le PMI zone euro était de 51,9 (avec une évolution positive 
commune au secteur des services – 51,6 – et à celui des produits manufacturiers – 
52,9) ;  
• Sur le plan financier, on observe une normalisation significative de la situation: i) les 
marchés obligataires périphériques poursuivent leur stabilisation et ont retrouvé des 
conditions de taux soutenables ; ii) la fragmentation au sein de la zone euro décroît – 
comme en témoignent par exemple la baisse des excédents de liquidité ou les 
balances Target 2. 
 
Comme nous l’avions prévu, nous sommes donc depuis le milieu de l’année dans une 
dynamique de reprise. Mais cette reprise est encore faible et fragile, notamment parce 
qu’elle part de niveaux très bas.  
 
Pourquoi partons-nous de niveaux de croissance si bas ? Pour deux raisons : 
• La zone euro a traversé une crise financière, économique et institutionnelle très 
sévère et complexe ;   
• Et, pour s’en sortir, elle ne s’est pas contentée de traiter la surface des problèmes ; 
elle a engagé des chantiers de fond, pour agir sur la racine des difficultés.  
 
Ces chantiers ont concerné toutes les causes de la crise. Les finances publiques ont été 
fortement redressées, le système bancaire a été assaini en profondeur, des réformes 
structurelles sont engagées pour améliorer la compétitivité des économies et la gouvernance 
économique de la zone euro a été renforcée.  
 
Naturellement, ces évolutions, menées simultanément et rapidement dans la plupart des 
pays de la zone, ont pesé sur la demande interne et sur la croissance. C’est la rançon du 
courage. Mais ces mesures ouvrent également la voie à une croissance future durable et 
robuste, car la zone euro a considérablement renforcé ses fondamentaux depuis lors. En 
termes budgétaires, nous avons le plus faible déficit public des zones développées et un 
solde primaire pratiquement à l’équilibre, et notre compétitivité progresse ainsi que notre 
excédent de balance des paiements en témoigne. 
3/5 
 
Actuellement, nous menons un autre chantier de réforme particulièrement crucial pour la 
croissance et la stabilité futures de la zone euro : la mise en place de l’union bancaire 
européenne.  
 
La crise a révélé qu’un système financier uniformément sain était essentiel pour la stabilité 
de l’ensemble de la zone euro et pour une bonne transmission de la politique monétaire 
unique. Une fois ce raisonnement bouclé, il a fallu penser la solution concrète. La clé de 
toute l’union bancaire pourrait se résumer dans cette phrase : il faut faire en sorte que les 
banques de la zone euro soient considérées comme telles, comme des banques « de la 
zone euro » et plus comme des banques « irlandaises », « allemandes » ou « italiennes ». 
 
Et pour cela, il faut mettre trois choses en place : 
1) une supervision fédérale des établissements, assurant que les mêmes règles et les 
mêmes méthodes de contrôle sont appliquées partout ; 
2) un mécanisme unifié de résolution des crises bancaires, pour éviter que la gestion d’une 
crise importante repose sur un seul État ; 
3) un système unifié de garantie des dépôts, pour éviter les phénomènes de panique 
bancaire. 
 
Depuis un an, les idées et les paroles se sont transformées en actes concrets. Permettez-
moi de faire un point sur l’état d’avancement des travaux à l’heure actuelle.  
 
1. Le principe de la création d’un mécanisme de supervision unique a été acté par les chefs 
d’État à la fin de l’année dernière et nous en préparons actuellement la mise en œuvre. Dans 
un an, les principales banques de la zone euro seront contrôlées par un système fédéralisé 
placé sous l’égide de la BCE et s’appuyant sur les équipes et l’expertise nationales. Par 
ailleurs, tout le système bancaire européen –y compris en Grande-Bretagne– sera supervisé 
sur la base d’un corpus réglementaire unique (Single Rulebook). 
Comme l’a indiqué la BCE le 23 octobre, nous travaillons maintenant activement à la 
préparation d’une évaluation exhaustive des bilans à laquelle les banques européennes 
seront soumises avant la mise en place du MSU en novembre 2014. Cet exercice sera sans 
précédent : environ 130 banques participantes, représentant 85 % du total des actifs des 
banques européennes, seront soumises de façon simultanée à un examen exhaustif de la 
qualité de leurs actifs, qui sera mené selon une méthodologie commune. L’objectif est triple : 
favoriser une plus grande transparence sur la situation du système bancaire européen, 
prendre les actions correctives nécessaires et enfin, rétablir la confiance. 
4/5 
Il s’agit là d’une grande chance offerte aux banques de montrer qu’elles ont assaini leurs 
bilans et qu’elles sont dignes de confiance. 
 
2. Comme mes collègues de la BCE, je considère que le Mécanisme de résolution unique 
constitue un autre pilier essentiel de l’union bancaire, avec le MSU. Le MRU devrait se 
composer de trois éléments principaux : un système unique, une autorité unique et un fonds 
unique, et il devra être en place au moment où le MSU deviendra opérationnel. Lors du 
dernier sommet européen du 22 octobre, tous les pays ont exprimé leur volonté de parvenir 
avant la fin de l’année à un accord sur la directive sur le redressement et la résolution des 
crises bancaires, afin que le MRU soit en place d’ici à 2015. 
 
Je tiens à le souligner encore une fois : la mise en œuvre de l’union bancaire constitue une 
étape décisive dans la construction d’une zone euro plus forte :  
<U+F0B7> Elle permettra de renforcer la stabilité du système bancaire européen ;  
<U+F0B7> Cette stabilité et la confiance retrouvées devraient permettre de stimuler la production 
de crédits bancaires qui sera nécessaire à la reprise ;  
<U+F0B7> Elle renforcera l’efficacité de la transmission de notre politique monétaire unique en 
renforçant notre principale courroie de transmission : le système bancaire.  
 
Permettez-moi, pour finir, de dire un mot de la stratégie de politique monétaire menée par 
l’Eurosystème.  
Depuis le début de la crise, nous avons utilisé tous les moyens à notre disposition, dans le 
respect de notre mandat, pour assurer notre mission – maintenir la stabilité des prix – et pour 
accompagner l’ajustement économique et financier dans la zone euro. Je voudrais revenir 
sur nos décisions les plus récentes : 
<U+F0B7> Par l’annonce des OMT l’année dernière, nous sommes parvenus à anéantir les 
spéculations d’éclatement de la zone. Nous avons convaincu de notre engagement 
infaillible à défendre la monnaie unique et avons ainsi tari une source d’inquiétudes 
extrêmes et injustifiées ;  
<U+F0B7> Nous avons assuré un soutien constant au refinancement des banques, pour pallier 
l’assèchement des marchés interbancaires et éviter une aggravation de la crise 
financière. Lors du dernier Conseil des gouverneurs, nous avons réitéré notre 
engagement en ce sens : nous avons décidé de continuer à effectuer les opérations 
principales de refinancement sous la forme d’appels d’offres à taux fixe, la totalité des 
soumissions étant servie, aussi longtemps que nécessaire et au moins jusqu’en 
juillet 2015 (c’est-à-dire au-delà de l’échéance de nos opérations de refinancement à 
long terme d’une durée de trois ans) ;  
5/5 
<U+F0B7> Nous menons une politique « conventionnelle » de taux très accommodante, comme 
en témoignent la récente baisse de notre principal taux de refinancement à 0.25 % et 
la poursuite de notre politique de Forward guidance. Nous le faisons pour assurer 
notre mission, qui consiste à maintenir, sur le moyen terme, une inflation inférieure à, 
mais proche de 2 %. Ce mandat est très clairement symétrique : l’inflation ne doit être 
ni trop forte, ni trop faible dans la zone euro, et ce pour des raisons fondamentales, 
en particulier dans cette période de réformes, de bon fonctionnement de l’économie. 
Même si les anticipations d’inflation restent bien ancrées dans la zone euro, plusieurs 
indicateurs nous ont convaincus que l’inflation resterait probablement très faible 
pendant une période prolongée, d’où la nécessité d’une réponse claire et rapide.  
 
Notre stratégie de politique monétaire est donc extrêmement claire : nous sommes 
déterminés à assurer la stabilité des prix dans la zone euro ; nous sommes déterminés à 
combattre la fragmentation financière de la zone pour que notre politique puisse être 
efficacement transmise.  
Ceci étant dit, bien évidemment, la politique monétaire ne peut pas et ne doit pas se 
substituer à des efforts de fond des différents États. Je pense en particulier à des efforts de 
redressement budgétaire calibrés pour ne pas heurter la reprise et à des réformes 
structurelles qui, seules, assureront la compétitivité et la croissance futures.  
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

« Répression réglementaire et politique monétaire » 
Discours de Robert Ophèle, second sous-gouverneur  
de la Banque de France 
 
« Mon propos ce matin est d’explorer dans quelles mesures la modification en profondeur de 
la réglementation s’appliquant aux institutions financières et plus particulièrement aux 
banques - et c’est en raison de l’importance que je crois largement sous-estimée dans 
l’opinion de ces modifications réglementaires que j’ai employé le terme provocateur de 
« répression réglementaire » - dans quelle mesure donc cette modification est susceptible 
d’affecter la politique monétaire, que cela soient les « grandes » décisions qui déterminent le 
caractère plus ou moins accommodant de cette politique monétaire – le « stance » - ou 
celles, plus techniques, qui fixent les instruments utilisés par la banque centrale pour mettre 
en œuvre cette politique monétaire. 
Le foisonnement réglementaire qui a suivi les sommets du G20 de Londres et de Pittsburgh 
en 2009, tant en matière de renforcement des fonds propres des banques, de mise en place 
de règles concernant leur liquidité et leur transformation, de gestion ordonnée des crises 
bancaires avec en particulier la participation des créanciers à la couverture des pertes, et 
enfin d’encadrement des opérations sur dérivés via leur compensation par des chambres et 
pour les opérations de gré à gré par l’imposition de marges initiales, tout cela a 
singulièrement modifié le cadre d’exercice de l’activité des banques en modifiant les 
incitations réglementaires donc les circuits financiers. 
Naturellement les incidences de ces réformes sont plus ou moins fortes selon les 
caractéristiques de chaque système bancaire (est-ce que les réformes mordent ou non), 
selon la structure de financement de chaque économie (intermédiation par des institutions 
financières versus  financements de marché ; financement par la dette ou par des fonds 
propres) et selon la position de chaque pays dans le cycle macroéconomique (la demande 
2 
 
de financement est-elle forte ou non). Je centrerai donc mes observations sur le cas de la 
zone euro et pour m’en tenir aux conséquences que la politique monétaire doit prendre en 
compte, structurerai ma présentation ce matin autour de deux idées :  
<U+F0B7> les modifications réglementaires en cours entrainent mécaniquement, toutes choses 
égales par ailleurs, une réduction de l’offre de crédits par les banques avec une 
baisse toute particulière sur les crédits à très long terme  et un renchérissement de 
l’ensemble de ces crédits ; cela devrait donc amener la banque centrale à conduire 
une politique plus accommodante que ce qui serait justifié par le contexte 
macroéconomique ; mais le calibrage de ce facteur spécifique est délicat à 
effectuer en raison de l’hétérogénéité de la zone euro ; 
<U+F0B7> les modalités d’intervention de la banque centrale, qui assurent la bonne 
transmission des décisions de politique monétaire, pourraient par ailleurs être 
reconsidérées en raison de deux types de facteurs : 
o les nouvelles réglementations modifient en profondeur la microstructure du 
marché monétaire, vecteur habituel de la transmission de la politique 
monétaire en zone euro : incitation aux arbitrages entre collatéral HQLA et 
non HQLA, incitation à se refinancer à plus d’un mois, pénalisation de 
l’intermédiation sur le marché monétaire ; tout cela pourrait conduire la 
banque centrale à modifier ses modalités d’intervention ; 
o les modifications réglementaires incitant par ailleurs à une désintermédiation 
du financement de l’économie il serait tentant de passer d’un modèle d’apport 
de liquidité banque centrale par le refinancement bancaire via la prise en 
pension d’actifs de bonne qualité à un modèle donnant une place plus 
importante aux achats de titres ; mais en zone euro la sélection de ces titres 
pose à l’évidence des problèmes spécifiques. 
Le graphique suivant (diapo 1)  illustre le raisonnement général : nous avons une 
accumulation de nouvelles réglementations qui modifient en profondeur le cadre d’exercice 
du métier bancaire ce qui a des effets sur la politique monétaire : 
 
1 ) Dès le début du processus d’élaboration des nouvelles normes prudentielles en 2009, les 
régulateurs ont essayé d’intégrer la mesure des effets macroéconomiques probables des 
réformes envisagées même s’il était clair que la quantification précise de ces effets était 
particulièrement incertaine avec des études aux résultats très divergents. 
En fait, tous les effets potentiellement négatifs de ces réformes ont été écrasés par la 
perspective de réduire, avec la mise en œuvre des nouvelles réglementations, la probabilité 
d’occurrence d’une crise financière majeure dont le coût économique est, nous l’avons vécu, 
très élevé. Je ne vais pas m’appesantir sur ce point qui n’a pas d’interaction directe avec la 
politique monétaire des années à venir mais je crois qu’il faut qu’on ait tous en tête à la fois 
l’importance quantitativement déterminante de ce facteur positif et son caractère pourtant 
très incertain. 
3 
 
<U+F0B7> Quantitativement dominant car on considère que le coût moyen actualisé d’une crise 
économique déclenchée par une crise financière est d’environ 60 % du PIB annuel1 
ce qui fait que toute réforme réduisant, même marginalement, la probabilité de crise 
est bénéfique car il est peu vraisemblable que son coût macroéconomique soit 
supérieur. Ainsi, même un risque a priori anecdotique comme le risque annuel de 
crise découlant du traitement actuel des opérations OTC sur dérivés, estimé à 0,26 % 
(soit une crise tous les 400 ans !)2, s’il est supprimé par une réforme réglementaire, 
« rapporte »  près de 20 points de PIB (0,0026x0,63) ; 
<U+F0B7> Mais tout cela est largement incertain car on combine l’incertitude sur la probabilité 
de crise, celle de l’effet des réformes sur cette probabilité et celle sur le coût effectif 
d’une crise ; dans ce dernier registre les estimations vont de 19 % du PIB annuel à 
153 % du PIB annuel selon qu’on considère ou non que la perte de PIB liée à une 
crise est définitive ou non. De ce fait, l’estimation du gain de PIB correspondant à la 
mise en place d’une réglementation de type Bâle 3 peut varier de façon 
considérable (diapo 2). 
   
Le caractère massif des gains attendus à long terme ne doit cependant pas occulter les 
incidences négatives de court terme à travers la réduction du financement bancaire du 
secteur privé qui pèsera sur la croissance: 
<U+F0B7> la très forte augmentation des exigences en fonds propres conduit à une réduction 
des crédits portés au bilan : soit qu’il soit plus simple de réduire la distribution de 
crédit que de lever des capitaux propres, soit que leur rentabilité doive être plus 
élevée pour assurer un ROE normal 
<U+F0B7> Les crédits les plus longs, qui dans le cas d’une gestion ALM doivent faire l’objet de 
couvertures sur les marchés dérivés seront tout particulièrement pénalisés compte 
tenu du renforcement des charges en capital sur les opérations de marché. 
<U+F0B7> Au sein des actifs bancaires, les actifs peu risqués – en fait les dettes souveraines 
par opposition aux crédits aux agents non financiers privés - donc peu exigeant en 
capital seront d’autant plus privilégiés qu’ils permettront de respecter la 
réglementation LCR.  
<U+F0B7> D’une manière générale, le coût de la ressource augmentera car l’effet bénéfique 
d’une hausse des fonds propres est contrebalancée par la concurrence accru sur les 
dépôts de la clientèle « retail » et la prime de risque qu’il faudra payer pour couvrir le 
risque de bail-in. 
 
Dans la plupart des modélisations l’incidence de ces réformes passe par une hausse du 
spread de crédit ce qui réduit la demande de crédit et pèse in fine sur la croissance. 
                                                          
1 La médiane des diverses estimations de la perte de PIB induite par une crise est de 63 %  (« An 
assessment of the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements » août 
2010 ; http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs173.pdf  ). 
2 « Macroeconomic impact asssessment of OTC derivatives regulatory reforms” août 2013  
http://www.bis.org/publ/othp20.pdf   
4 
 
L’incidence dépend du temps mis par les banques pour s’adapter ; plus l’adaptation est 
rapide et donc concentrée dans le temps plus le choc est important. 
La hausse des spreads était estimée par le Macroeconomic Assessment Group, mandaté 
par le FSB et le BCBS pour évaluer l’impact des mesures envisagées, à environ 13 points de 
base par point de ratio de solvabilité pondéré :  
En fait,    
<U+F0B7> Bâle 3 était supposé se traduire par une augmentation du ratio de capital de 130 
points de base, qui, mise en œuvre sur 4 ans, impliquait une hausse des spreads de 
crédit d’un peu plus de 30 bp et une baisse maximale ponctuelle de la croissance 
annuelle du PIB de 0,19 % ; 
<U+F0B7> La couche SIFIs se traduirait par une augmentation du ratio de capital de 200 points 
de base pour cette catégorie de banques, qui, mise en œuvre sur  4 ans, impliquerait 
une hausse des spreads de crédit de près de 35 bp et une baisse maximale 
ponctuelle de la croissance annuelle de 12 bp   
 
Naturellement il fallait ajouter à cela l’effet de la réglementation de la liquidité ; soit 25 points 
estimés au titre du NFSR. L’effet combiné sur les spreads pouvait cependant être réduit par 
une substitution à l’intérieur des actifs des banques entre crédits associés à un RWA élevé 
et titres de haute qualité liquides à très faible RWA. Mais in fine l’estimation de l’incidence 
totale de la réglementation était comprise entre 50 et 75 points de base. 
Ces approches, très « macro », même si elles utilisent pour certaines des DSGE, doivent 
toutefois être confrontées avec des approches plus micro qui ont plutôt tendance à mettre en 
évidence des effets des réglementations plus forts sur la distribution du crédit que ce qui 
ressort des approches « macro ». 
<U+F0B7> Ainsi, à partir de données couvrant la période où l’ABE a demandé la recapitalisation 
d’une partie du système bancaire européen, à savoir octobre 2011 – juin 2012, des 
travaux conduits à la Banque de France (Mesonnier et Monks “Did the EBA Capital 
Exercise lead to a Credit Crunch in the Euro Area?” 2013 document de travail à 
paraître) montrent que pour 1 point de ratio à combler, les banques concernées ont 
réduit leur distribution de crédit de 1,3 %. 
<U+F0B7> De même Brun, Fraisse et Thesmar dans un papier récent3 mesurant l’effet sur la 
distribution de crédit induit par le passage de Bâle 2 par rapport à Bâle 1 à partir des 
données individuelles de crédits aux entreprises françaises et des modèles internes 
des banques, laisse à penser qu’un durcissement (allègement) de 1 point des 
exigences en fonds propres, se traduit par une réduction (hausse) de 3 à 8 % de la 
distribution de crédit aux société non financières. 
 
Naturellement les modèles macro intègrent une fonction de réaction de la banque centrale ; 
face à ce choc exogène sur l’offre de crédit et à la hausse des taux associée, les banques 
                                                          
3 The Real Effects of bank Capital Requirement, Juillet 2013

centrales sont censées conduire une politique monétaire plus accommodante. C'est-à-dire 
avoir des taux directeurs plus bas que normalement nécessaire. La difficulté de l’exercice 
tient à la mesure du phénomène ;  celui-ci varie selon la place des financements intermédiés 
par les systèmes bancaires et le degré de morsure des nouvelles réglementations, or force 
est de constater que ceux-ci sont très différents à l’intérieur de la zone euro. 
S’agissant de la structure de financement, on voit d’abord  que l’endettement des SNF varie 
du simple (Allemagne) à plus du double (Italie et Espagne) avec des trajectoires assez 
différentes (baisse en Espagne, accroissement en France). De plus, alors que l’émission de 
titres négociables de dettes, donc le financement de marché, couvre moins de 3 % des 
besoins d’endettement des sociétés non financières en Espagne , il en couvre près de 40 % 
en France, qui est de ce point de vue le pays de la zone le plus « avancé » - je mets avancé 
entre guillemets-, en raison de la place importante des très grandes  entreprises dans 
l’économie française. 
Pénaliser le financement bancaire aura donc une incidence beaucoup plus forte en Espagne 
qu’en France (diapo 3). 
S’agissant de l’incidence des évolutions réglementaires, la répartition par pays des efforts à 
effectuer n’est pas publique mais on peut se référer ici au suivi qu’en fait l’EBA4  qui illustre 
bien la dispersion des situations (diapo 4): 
<U+F0B7> S’agissant des ratios pondérés de solvabilité,  si le plancher de 4,50 % de CET1 est 
atteint par la quasi-totalité des banques, il reste du chemin à parcourir pour que tous 
les établissements constituent leur conservation buffer d’ici la fin de la période de 
montée en puissance du dispositif (2019) ; au 30 juin 2012 il « manquait » près de 
400 Md€, sans intégrer le coussin des banques systémiques qui je le rappelle peut 
aller jusqu’à 2,50 %, ni de coussin contra-cyclique.  
<U+F0B7> S’agissant du ratio de levier, on observe qu’en gros seule la moitié des 
établissements le respecteraient sur une base de capital « full Bâle 3 »  
<U+F0B7> Quant au ratio de transformation, qui ne devrait pas être mis en place avant 2018, la 
situation est plus simple puisque quasiment personne ne le respecterait ; le manque 
de ressources longues est estimé à 1 230 milliards d’euros mais là encore la 
dispersion des situations est grande. 
<U+F0B7> S’agissant enfin du ratio de liquidité à court terme, le LCR, l’analyse conduite par 
l’EBA à fin décembre 2012, qui va  être  publiée, met en évidence l’ampleur 
finalement réduite en valeur absolue du gap à combler pour atteindre un ratio de 
100 % qui est la cible minimale en 2019 mais avec tout de même un tiers des 
établissements couverts par l’exercice qui sont concernés. Mais ces chiffres sont à 
l’évidence des minorants de la situation en raison du caractère exceptionnel de la 
situation de fin 2012 avec un excédent de liquidité banque centrale particulièrement 
élevé qui n’a pas vocation à perdurer que ce soit dans la zone euro (plus de 600 
Md€ à fin 2012) au Royaume Uni (près de 300 Md£) ou aux Etats-Unis (1500 Md$). 
Il faut prendre également en compte la répartition par pays de cette insuffisance, 
très concentré sur certains pays et ce n’est pas un secret que de rappeler que si les 
banques françaises sont bien placées en termes de solvabilité elles sont moins bien 
positionnées en termes de liquidité.

Naturellement, les conséquences de l’hétérogénéité des situations que je viens d’évoquer 
miroitent avec la fragmentation financière que subit par ailleurs la zone euro avec l’absence 
de marché unique du crédit alimenté par une circulation fluide des capitaux à l’intérieur de la 
zone. 
La politique monétaire est donc face à une difficulté singulière, réagir à un choc 
réglementaire dont les effets sont très différents d’un pays à l’autre. Alors même que  les 
taux directeurs sont déjà très proches du fameux Zero Lower Bound, c’est plus sur la durée 
de la politique accommodante qu’il faudra jouer que sur son niveau. De fait, l’hétérogénéité 
des situations nationales dans le contexte d’une union monétaire sans union bancaire ralentit 
singulièrement la transmission des décisions de politique monétaire dans l’économie réelle. 
J’attire votre attention, sur cet aspect de ralentissement qui est très important pour 
comprendre la fonction de réaction actuelle de la BCE qui est, je crois, bien caractérisée par 
une des réponses du Président Draghi lors de sa dernière conférence de presse :  
The final point I would like to make is that it would be wrong to think that we determine our 
monetary policy on the basis of a single figure for inflation. It would also be wrong to think 
that the effects of our monetary policy are instantaneous. They are anything but that. It takes 
time for the full effects to materialize and the amount of time it takes depends on many 
factors, in particular two. What is the state of banks’ balance sheets? And what is the state of 
the private sector’s balance sheets? The greater the deleveraging process that needs to be 
undertaken by both banks and corporates, the longer it will take for our monetary policy to 
have its full impact. That is why the asset quality review is so important, because it could 
actually shorten this period of time. 
 
2) J’en viens à mon second point qui concerne les instruments de la politique monétaire. 
Toutes ces nouvelles réglementations modifient singulièrement le régime général des 
incitations qui commandent les décisions financières des agents économiques ;  
<U+F0B7> il y a d’abord des incitations fortes à la désintermédiation  bancaire qui vont réduire la 
place du canal du crédit bancaire, le « bank lending chanel » de la théorie monétaire, 
dans les mécanismes de transmission de la politique monétaire ; 
<U+F0B7> et puis il y a des incitations qui affectent la microstructure du marché monétaire donc 
les canaux traditionnels d’intervention de la politique monétaire. 
Evoquons d’abord les conséquences possible de la désintermédiation, évolution que 
l’Eurosystème doit  préparer, accompagner et qui, à terme, conduira à adapter les 
instruments de la politique monétaire. 
On sait que ce mouvement de désintermédiation passe par trois canaux principaux : l’appel 
public à l’épargne, le placement privé et la titrisation ; pour que cette titrisation ait un effet 
réglementaire il faut qu’elle soit déconsolidante. La Banque de France contribue à ses 
évolutions par son action de Place, mais, s’agissant de politique monétaire, ces évolutions 
lourdes pourraient pointer vers une politique monétaire qui effectuerait ses injections de 
liquidité non plus via le refinancement des banques mais par des achats de titres sur le 
marché ; une politique monétaire classique dans les pays anglo-saxons, comme l’illustre (cf. 
7 
 
diapo 5) la mise en perspective des actifs du système fédéral US (4000 Md$ de titres acquis 
dans le cadre de la politique monétaire) et de l’Eurosystème (moins de 250 Md€ acquis dans 
le cadre des programmes SMP et CBPP). 
Une telle perspective se heurte cependant aux difficultés techniques classiques de la zone 
euro ; en l’absence d’intégration financière et institutionnelle forte, il n’y a pas, contrairement 
aux États-Unis, d’émetteur significatif couvrant l’ensemble de la zone, il n’y a donc pas de 
réel gisement de titres zone euro à acheter. La Commission européenne (via les 
mécanismes d’aide à la balance des paiements et d’assistance macro-financière) ou la BEI 
ont un périmètre qui dépasse la zone euro ; les institutions proprement zone euro ont une 
dette limitée : le  FESF a une dette de 175 Md€ et un engagement total de 192 Md€, le MES 
a une capacité maximale d’intervention de 500 Md€ mais seuls 50 Md€ sont mobilisés à ce 
stade. Par ailleurs il n’y a pas en zone euro de structures de titrisation de type Fanny Mae ou 
Freddy Mac couvrant l’ensemble de la zone. 
Dès lors, l’achat de titres revient à des achats de titres nationaux, souverains ou non. Pour 
les titres souverains il pourrait s’agir d’acheter des paniers de titres, chaque pays étant 
pondéré en fonction de son poids dans la clef du capital BCE, mais on voit bien que les 
différences dans la qualité des signatures, qui sont actuellement prises en compte par des 
grilles de haircuts adaptées à la notation des émetteurs et à la duration des papiers, poserait 
de redoutables problèmes d’acceptation politique. La solution retenue lors des programmes 
d’achat d’obligations sécurisées (CBPP1 et 2), qui laissait le risque de crédit aux BCN, ne 
pourrait à l’évidence pas être retenue dans un cadre normal de mise en œuvre de la 
politique monétaire, qui ne peut être fondé que sur un partage des revenus et des risques à 
l’intérieur de l’Eurosystème. 
Il semble donc que le refinancement des banques restera pour de nombreuses années, le 
mode privilégié d’alimentation en liquidité banque centrale ; cela rend donc vraiment crucial 
une adaptation de nos instruments en prenant en compte l’évolution de la microstructure du 
marché monétaire que va entraîner les réformes réglementaires. 
Or ces réformes vont probablement affecter en profondeur le marché monétaire. 
<U+F0B7> Il est clair que le LCR, en introduisant une différence de traitement entre les 
opérations à moins et à plus d’un mois restant à courir, va en premier lieu entraîner 
une désaffection pour les opérations les plus courtes et un renchérissement des 
opérations sur le segment 1/3 mois. Dès lors, la politique monétaire de la BCE qui, 
via ses opérations à une semaine (les MRO), se concentre sur la partie la plus courte 
de la courbe des taux pourrait perdre de sa lisibilité donc de son efficacité. On peut 
donc s’interroger sur un éventuel rallongement des opérations principales. 
 
<U+F0B7> En second lieu, le traitement favorable accordé par le LCR et probablement par le 
NFSR au refinancement banque centrale par rapport au refinancement de marché va 
inciter les banques à se refinancer en priorité à la banque centrale et en priorité en 
mettant en pension des actifs qui n’ont pas de la meilleure catégorie au titre du LCR. 
Je rappelle par exemple que les refinancements de banque centrale ne donnent lieu 
à aucune fuite au titre du LCR quel que soit le collatéral apporté alors que les mises 
en pension dans le marché donnent lieu à une sortie de fonds sous 30 jours si le 
collatéral n’est pas de la meilleure catégorie (les HQLA de niveau 1, en gros les titres 
8 
 
d’État). Cela incitera donc les établissements à se financer en priorité à la banque 
centrale avec du collatéral non HQLA qui d’ailleurs représente déjà une fraction 
grandissante des actifs déposés en garantie des opérations de politique monétaire et 
des soldes débiteurs intra-day dans Target (cf. diapo 6). 
 
Il y a donc un risque que la banque centrale devienne progressivement non plus le 
prêteur de dernier ressort de la littérature mais, pour reprendre le mot récent de 
Benoit Coeuré, le prêteur de premier ressort. Dans le dispositif actuel de 
refinancement fixed rate full allotment, cela signifie en effet qu’on peut utiliser le 
refinancement banque centrale uniquement pour respecter son ratio de LCR ; ce qui 
est l’exact opposé de ce qui était recherché par cette réglementation : rendre les 
banques moins dépendantes de l’intervention des banques centrales. Si la BCE 
devait revenir à une alimentation contingentée en fonction du besoin effectif en 
liquidité banque centrale du système bancaire consolidé de la zone euro, le système 
habituel d’adjudication à la hollandaise se traduirait mécaniquement par une hausse 
du prix de la liquidité puisqu’aux demandes classiques de gestion de trésorerie 
s’ajoutera pour certaines banques une demande de nature purement réglementaire.5 
 
<U+F0B7> En fait, il n’est pas certain que le retour à un mode d’alimentation en fonction d’un 
besoin net de liquidité soit facilement envisageable car cela ne fonctionne que si la 
liquidité circule effectivement dans le système bancaire ce qui nécessite des banques 
actives sur le marché monétaire. Or la combinaison d’un ratio de levier, d’un ratio de 
liquidité à court terme et d’un ratio à long terme NFSR pourrait être dévastatrice pour 
l’activité d’intermédiation sur le marché monétaire. En effet, une telle activité accroît 
la taille du bilan (mauvais pour le ratio de levier), pénalise la transformation moins 
d’un mois / plus d’un mois tout en butant en tout état de cause sur le plafonnement 
des entrées de fonds à moins d’un mois à 75 % des sorties de fonds à plus d’un mois 
(mauvais pour le LCR), et n’est pas recevable, s’agissant des financement à moins 
d’un an pour un adossement d’emplois à moins d’un an (mauvais pour le NFSR). 
L’ampleur de ces effets dépend toutefois du résultat final de la négociation en cours 
sur la définition précise du ratio de levier et en particulier de l’acceptation ou non des 
compensations lorsque des accords de netting existent ainsi que de la finalisation du 
dispositif NFSR. Sur ces deux points des décisions d’assouplissement sont attendues 
en janvier prochain. 
 
Dans la mesure où le refinancement des banques restera pour de nombreuses années, le 
mode privilégié d’alimentation en liquidité banque centrale de la zone euro,  l’adaptation de 
nos instruments à l’évolution de la microstructure du marché monétaire est donc essentielle ; 
définition du collatéral éligible, échéance des opérations principales, taux de marché cible, 
largeur du corridor  … tous ces éléments seront probablement revisités une fois les cadres 
réglementaires stabilisés. 
Je vous remercie de votre attention. »

« L’Union Économique et Monétaire et la paix en Europe » 
Discours d’Anne Le Lorier, premier sous-gouverneur de la Banque de France 
devant des étudiants français et allemands 
Sarrebruck (Allemagne), 15 janvier 2014 
 
 
« D’abord, je voudrais remercier Carl-Ludwig Thiele
1
 et Yves Mersch
2
 de m’avoir invitée à 
participer à ce colloque, je suis particulièrement heureuse de m’exprimer devant des jeunes.  
J’ai à traiter d’un sujet qui est un peu original pour un banquier central, ce qui est stimulant et 
que j’apprécie. Le sujet, vous le connaissez, est « L’Union Économique et Monétaire et la 
paix en Europe ». Je vais tenter de développer trois points. Le premier est que l’intégration 
économique et financière et l’union monétaire ont été conçues comme un instrument au 
service de la paix et je vais vous en rappeler quelques étapes. Le deuxième point est que le 
processus et les normes qui régissent l’Union Économique et Monétaire pourraient être un 
modèle ou une source d’inspiration pour la gouvernance mondiale. Le troisième point ce sont 
les conditions de la poursuite du succès de l’Union Monétaire et du renforcement de la 
cohésion européenne. 
Je voudrais d’abord faire un rapide retour en arrière. Pourquoi finalement avoir conçu 
l’économie et la monnaie comme des outils au service de la paix ? Pour une raison très 
simple : il y a très longtemps, d’éminents philosophes, penseurs, ont imaginé des solutions 
pour la paix en Europe. Au début du XVIII
e
 siècle, l’abbé de Saint-Pierre en France avait un 
projet pour rendre la paix perpétuelle en Europe. À la fin du XVIII
e
, Kant, autre éminent 
philosophe, avait un projet d’État européen regroupant tous les pays. Vous connaissez la 
suite, elle n’est pas brillante du point de vue de la paix. Après le traumatisme de la 1
ere
 
guerre mondiale, il y eut de nouveau des propositions pour une Europe pacifiée, en 
particulier, Aristide Briand et Gustav Stresemann se sont exprimés devant la Société Des 
Nations pour un État européen. Puis il y a eu la 2
e
 guerre mondiale. Finalement nous nous 
trouvions dans la situation où l’Europe avait été à l’origine des deux plus graves conflits 
mondiaux du XX
e
 siècle. Heureusement, un certain nombre de personnes, après la 2
e

 Membre du Directoire de la Deutsche Bundesbank 
2
 Membre du Directoire de la Banque Centrale Européenne 
guerre, ont fait preuve d’un très grand volontarisme et d’une très grande clairvoyance, et 
plutôt que de relancer exclusivement des projets politiques, ils ont développé un projet 
économique et monétaire. Vous savez qu’ils ont réussi, que la Communauté du Charbon et 
de l’Acier, puis le traité de la Communauté Économique Européenne ont permis notamment  
de totalement transformer les relations entre la France et l’Allemagne. Vous savez que la 
même dynamique a permis de réussir la transition après la chute du Mur de Berlin. Nous 
avons donc aujourd’hui, en quelque sorte, la preuve que l’économie et la monnaie sont des 
instruments extraordinairement puissants au service de la paix. Ne vous trompez pas, je ne 
suis pas en train de faire l’apologie de l’économie et de la monnaie, il ne s’agit pas d’être 
attaché à une Europe purement financière. Il s’agit simplement de constater que face à un 
objectif politique qui était la paix en Europe, l’outil le plus efficace a été l’intégration 
économique et monétaire par contraste avec beaucoup d’autres projets. Je vous rappelle par 
exemple qu’il n’a pas été possible après la 2
e
 guerre mondiale de mettre en place une 
Communauté Européenne de la Défense. Et pourtant, il y avait de bonnes raisons de le faire. 
Permettez-moi de me référer à un des pères de l’euro. Étant en Allemagne, je ne peux pas 
ne pas le citer : Helmut Kohl a dit que la réalisation de l’Union Monétaire était la condition de 
la paix pour le XXI
e
 siècle. Nous sommes au XXI
e
 siècle : il avait raison, me semble t-il. 
Que dire de plus sur l’euro ? Je sais qu’il n’a pas toujours été très bien accueilli en 
Allemagne. Mais aujourd’hui il est accepté en Allemagne. Ce qui compte finalement, c’est ce 
qu’est véritablement une monnaie. Quand on est enfant, on apprend à compter, on 
comprend qu’un bonbon ce n’est pas gratuit, il faut l’acheter, on a une tirelire. Quel est le 
premier support de l’apprentissage ? C’est la monnaie. Pour vous, pour vos enfants, c’est 
l’euro. Il y a un point très intéressant dans l’évolution de l’iconographie de la monnaie. Carl-
Ludwig (Thiele) en parlerait mieux que moi, car il est très savant sur les signes monétaires, 
et Yves (Mersch) aussi qui est responsable notamment de l’activité fiduciaire à la BCE. 
Regardez ce qu’il y a aujourd’hui sur les billets en euros : il y a des ponts, il y a des 
bâtiments, il y a des symboles européens. Quand j’étais enfant, sur les billets, il y avait des 
hommes historiques français qui n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation dans le domaine de la 
paix. Je me souviens par exemple d’un billet avec le portrait de Napoléon Bonaparte. 
Aujourd’hui, par contre, sur les billets en euros, figurent des portes et des ponts et 
l’incarnation mythique de l’Europe, la déesse Europa. Ce n’est pas neutre sachant qu’une 
des valeurs les plus précieuses que nous partageons aujourd’hui est la paix. 
Pour passer à des questions plus institutionnelles ou juridiques, permettez-moi de vous 
rappeler que, dans le domaine économique et monétaire, entre les deux guerres mondiales, 
les pays européens ont souffert de désordres monétaires considérables, de dévaluations 
compétitives, de perte de valeur de la monnaie. Cela a été un véritable traumatisme en 
Allemagne. Il était très important de se protéger contre la répétition de tels phénomènes. Et 
là encore, il ne s’agit pas seulement de finances, il s’agit de démocratie. Quand une monnaie 
s’effondre, l’État est en général peu solide, les extrémismes ne sont pas loin et la guerre non 
plus. Le sujet n’est donc pas uniquement d’avoir une monnaie unique, c’est d’avoir une 
monnaie stable. Et cela, vous le savez, est la priorité de l’Union Monétaire et est consigné 
dans le Traité. La mission et le travail permanent de la Banque Centrale Européenne sont  
de veiller à la stabilité de l’euro. Là aussi, la démocratie, les objectifs politiques ne sont pas 
loin. 
Qu’est-ce qui permet d’être confiant dans le fait que la Banque Centrale Européenne, et 
avec elles l’Eurosystème vont remplir leurs missions ? Je sais qu’en Allemagne, il y a 
beaucoup de craintes sur ce sujet qui s’expriment très souvent. Pourquoi avez-vous des 
raisons d’être confiants ? Pour des raisons très simples. En premier lieu, il y a un traité, ce 
traité s’impose à tous les États de l’Union Européenne et en particulier à ceux qui sont 
aujourd’hui membres de la zone euro pour ce qui concerne la mission de la Banque Centrale 
Européenne.  
La deuxième raison pour laquelle vous avez raison d’avoir confiance  est que les 
gouverneurs et les membres du directoire de la Banque Centrale Européenne ne sont pas 
des représentants nationaux et il leur est interdit de raisonner en fonction de leurs intérêts 
nationaux. Cela est écrit noir sur blanc dans le traité et ils ont à cœur de le respecter. Cet 
ensemble de responsables, experts éminents, décident collégialement des décisions à 
prendre. Évidemment, ils ne sont pas toujours spontanément d’accord, évidemment, ils 
débattent, mais évidemment ils sont responsables, parviennent à des décisions et ces 
décisions sont parfaitement conformes à l’objectif de stabilité de la monnaie. Je vais vous 
donner deux chiffres pour vous montrer que les résultats obtenus ne sont pas si mauvais : 
quelle a été l’inflation dans la zone euro depuis la création de l’euro ? La réponse est 
simple : 1,9%. Quel est l’objectif dans le Traité : 2%. On ne peut pas dire qu’on soit loin de la 
cible. Deuxième exemple : quelle était la part des monnaies européennes dans les réserves 
en devises internationales ? Selon la monnaie – c’est très inégal – au maximum pour l’une 
d’elle, on va dire 15%. Quelle est la part de l’euro aujourd’hui ? Entre 24 et 25% des 
réserves en devises mondiales. L’euro a fait un bon parcours, il a de la crédibilité.  
Tout ceci a été accompli dans un ensemble de normes qui ne sont pas propres à la zone 
euro, qui sont des normes européennes, qui ont été l’outil de construction de l’Europe et qui 
ont quelque chose d’intéressant pour la communauté mondiale. Il y a deux principes en 
quelque sorte : la légitimité du droit, point essentiel ici en Allemagne et  il y a une adhésion 
totale de l’ensemble des pays européens à cette approche. Le deuxième principe, c’est la 
subsidiarité. Je sais que la réalité de son application est souvent contestée et que l’on cite 
souvent des règlements un peu techniques, un peu étonnants par leur niveau de détail. Il 
reste que dans le cas de l’Union Monétaire, nous sommes vraiment dans un système fédéral 
avec des décisions fédérales prises par l’organe en charge, le Conseil des gouverneurs et 
une mise en œuvre déconcentrée. C’est un système sur lequel, d’une certaine façon, la 
culture allemande a montré la voie. Le dernier point – et non des moindres – est le fait que la 
communication se fait dans toutes les langues européennes. Si vous allez sur le site de la 
BCE, vous constaterez que l’ensemble des langues de la zone euro peuvent y être utilisées. 
Ce qui veut dire très concrètement que les citoyens ont accès à l’ensemble des informations 
de la Banque Centrale Européenne, à l’explication de l’ensemble de ses décisions. C’est un 
exemple de gouvernance intéressant.  
Sur la place et le rôle de l’Europe dans le monde, vous avez certainement lu beaucoup de 
choses. Il y a eu deux réactions un peu extrêmes qui se sont avérées fausses, et c’est pour 
cela que l’on peut dire avec confiance que l’intégration monétaire est au service de la paix. 
La première réaction a été de dire que l’Europe allait être une forteresse et que cette 
forteresse allait être hostile au reste du monde. C’est exactement le contraire qui s’est 
produit, l’Europe a réussi, Carl-Ludwig (Thiele) l’a rappelé, elle constitue le premier pôle 
économique mondial. On peut aussi dire que c’est le premier ensemble d’États qui œuvrent 
autant pour faire prévaloir la notion de négociations internationales et de normes 
internationales. La seconde réaction adverse a été de dire : l’Union Européenne se fait car 
l’Europe est tellement faible qu’elle ne peut s’en sortir que comme cela. Là aussi la réponse, 
c’est la réussite de l’Europe. Un ancien ministre allemand a bien résumé le fait que ni l’une ni 
l’autre de ces critiques n’étaient justes : Joschka Fischer, votre ministre des Affaires 
étrangères pendant de nombreuses années, a expliqué qu’au cœur de la réussite 
européenne, il y aurait toujours le rejet des traités d’autrefois qui se partageaient le monde et 
reflétaient des ambitions hégémoniques. C’est cela aussi l’exemple européen, ce n’est pas 
uniquement un exemple économique et financier, c’est un exemple de corps de normes pour 
l’ensemble du monde.  
S’agissant de l’avenir, maintenant, quelles sont les conditions pour poursuivre dans la 
réussite de l’Union Monétaire ? Nous avons traversé de fortes  turbulences, il y a eu ces 
craintes de « redénomination » c'est-à-dire de sorties de la zone euro. Quelles sont les 
réponses ? Yves (Mersch) vous les a rappelées : il y a la réponse de l’Union bancaire, il y a 
aussi la réponse sur la discipline macro-économique, et il est important de souligner qu’elle 
n’est pas simplement budgétaire. Bien sûr elle est budgétaire, bien sûr elle est très renforcée 
sur les aspects budgétaires, mais il y a aussi une surveillance de l’ensemble des indicateurs 
macro-économiques. Je vous rappelle que l’une des évolutions qui a été à tort ignorée par 
les marchés et par les autorités a été l’évolution du solde des transactions courantes de 
chacun des pays de la zone. Il aurait fallu s’en préoccuper. Derrière la dégradation ou 
l’amélioration de ces soldes, il y avait bien sûr l’évolution des coûts unitaires du travail et de 
la compétitivité. La surveillance porte maintenant un large spectre d’indicateurs et comporte  
des procédures contraignantes qui ne vont pas permettre beaucoup d’indiscipline. Pour 
autant, nous ne sommes pas au dernier état d’achèvement de l’Union Économique et 
Monétaire.  
Qu’est-ce qui peut rendre confiant dans le fait qu’il s’agit d’une Union pérenne ? Là encore, il 
y a deux thèses extrêmes. Il y a une thèse cynique qui dit : l’Europe Économique et 
Monétaire où la zone euro ne peut pas changer de contours parce que le coût serait 
considérable et excessif. Personne dans le monde n’a intérêt à l’échec de la zone euro. Il est 
vrai que quand l’on imagine le nombre de milliards concernés dans un scénario théorique de 
retour à d’autres monnaies, il y a certainement là une dissuasion assez forte. Mais cela ne 
suffit pas. L’autre aspect, c’est bien sûr au-delà du raisonnement économique l’idéal et 
l’objectif de la paix et je crois que l’on peut faire confiance aux jeunes générations pour 
poursuivre dans cette voie. Y a-t-il encore aujourd’hui des sujets d’incompréhension ou 
d’inquiétude dans les différents pays de la zone euro, parmi nos concitoyens ? Bien sûr mais 
en même temps, le bon sens est une valeur assez répandue. Ce que je veux dire par là, 
c’est que la crise n’est pas là tout à fait par hasard et qu’il y a un certain nombre de 
personnes qui ont très bien compris que les dettes excessives, par exemple, ne peuvent 
persister longtemps. Il peut et il doit y avoir des débats sur la manière de gérer la crise mais 
il n’y a pas beaucoup de débats sur l’origine de  la crise. La prise de conscience est 
maintenant collective. Un exemple est celui de l’Espagne : les causes de la crise y étaient 
évidentes, elles ont  été identifiées, traitées au prix d’efforts considérables et maintenant 
l’Espagne en recueille les premiers fruits. C’est un exemple qui permet de comprendre que 
la sortie de crise ce n’est pas uniquement l’affaire de la politique monétaire, c’est aussi 
l’affaire des gouvernements, l’affaire des réformes et aussi, et surtout, l’affaire des citoyens. 
 
 
Pour tenter de conclure, trois points :  
Le premier qui déconcerte toujours beaucoup le monde extérieur, les pays hors de l’Europe : 
l’Europe se fait dans la crise. On a l’impression que l’on sait progresser quand on est 
confronté à une grande difficulté. C’est un peu frustrant, on pourrait dire que l’on pourrait 
progresser sans crise. En même temps, c’est d’une certaine façon un facteur de robustesse 
puisqu’à chaque fois, la crise est différente et à chaque fois on trouve des réponses 
adaptées.  
Le deuxième est la relation entre l’Union Européenne et la paix. Juste une remarque : nous 
sommes aujourd’hui dans la situation où la Croatie vient de devenir membre de l’Union 
Européenne et où la Serbie est candidate à être membre de l’Union Européenne. Je pense 
que si vous vous étiez posé la question de cette éventualité il y a cinq ans, vous auriez 
considéré que c’était impossible. Cela veut dire que l’Europe est capable non seulement de 
préserver la paix entre ses pays membres mais aussi d’être un exemple de paix. Autre 
exemple mais qui lui n’a pas abouti. Quand l’euro a été créé, il y a eu un projet au Moyen-
Orient, une des zones les plus conflictuelles de la terre, une tentative de mettre sur pied une 
union monétaire. Malheureusement ça n’a pas abouti, peut-être était-ce trop difficile 
économiquement. Il reste que cela montre que l’Union monétaire n’est pas un univers de 
« financiers », c’est un univers porteur de valeurs beaucoup plus importantes.  
Le troisième dernier point vous concerne plus directement : je suis désolée de ne pas parler 
Allemand mais je sais que parmi vous beaucoup sont bilingues Français et Allemand et 
maîtrisent sans doute d’autres langues. On a beaucoup développé les échanges d’étudiants. 
Peut-être connaissez-vous le programme Erasmus, peut-être en avez-vous été ou en serez-
vous, vous-mêmes, membres. La Chancelière allemande a proposé récemment qu’il y ait en 
quelque sorte un Erasmus pour les apprentis, et je souscris entièrement à cette idée en tant 
que citoyen. La mobilité des personnes à l’intérieur de l’Europe et en particulier à l’intérieur 
de la zone euro, pas simplement pour du tourisme mais pour des projets professionnels, est 
certainement un moteur d’union extraordinairement puissant. Elle  est dans vos mains, à 
vous de jouer. »

Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
Vœux à la Place - 16 janvier 2014 
 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
J’ai souhaité, comme c’est devenu la tradition,  vous réunir ce soir pour vous présenter mes 
vœux les meilleurs pour l’année 2014. Ces vœux s’adressent bien sûr à vous-même mais 
aussi à l’ensemble des collaborateurs de vos établissements.  
 
L’année écoulée a été une nouvelle fois très dense. Elle n’a certainement pas manqué 
d’épisodes critiques - rappelons-nous le cas de Chypre, du shutdown américain ou encore les 
difficultés rencontrées par certains pays émergents.  
Mais 2013 a, surtout, marqué un tournant vers une « normalisation » progressive de 
l’environnement économique et financier, notamment en zone euro. Des progrès importants 
ont en effet été réalisés pour renforcer la stabilité et la cohérence de l’union économique et 
monétaire – en particulier les avancées de l’union bancaire sur lesquelles je vais revenir.  
Pour vos établissements, 2013 aura, en outre, acté une poursuite déterminée des efforts 
engagés pour préparer l’entrée en vigueur des nouvelles réglementations et pour rester 
compétitifs dans un monde qui ne cesse d’évoluer.  
 
2014 sera, j’en suis sûr, l’année de la confirmation de ces avancées et de l’affirmation d’un 
système financier français et européen robuste, capable de soutenir une croissance plus 
dynamique. Le financement adéquat de la reprise économique sera en effet absolument clé 
en 2014. Et j’espère d’ailleurs que les réformes annoncées – qui sont cruciales pour notre 
économie et pour l’emploi - pourront être mises en œuvre rapidement et commencer à 
porter leurs fruits dès cette année. 
 
Permettez-moi de détailler plus précisément les différents axes qui seront, à mes yeux, 
prioritaires en 2014. 
*** 
2 
 
 
Réussir la transition vers l’union bancaire européenne 
Comme je vous l’ai dit, une grande avancée a marqué l’année 2013 selon moi, c’est la 
concrétisation du projet d’union bancaire européenne. Les mots et les idées se sont très 
rapidement transformés en actes. Et c’est une performance qui mérite d’être soulignée.  
Dans moins d’un an maintenant, les principaux groupes bancaires français seront supervisés 
par le Mécanisme de Supervision Unique, sous l’égide de la BCE et en coopération étroite 
avec l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution.  
D’ici là, un challenge particulièrement ambitieux devra avoir été relevé : celui de l’exercice 
de revue préalable des actifs bancaires. Vous connaissez l’idée sous-jacente : il s’agit de faire 
démarrer la supervision unique sur des bases transparentes et robustes et restaurer ainsi la 
confiance des investisseurs et des marchés dans le système bancaire européen. C’est un 
chantier sans précédent, qui requiert un engagement énorme de la part à la fois des 
« contrôleurs » et des « contrôlés ». Je sais que je peux compter sur votre coopération la 
plus totale en 2014 pour assurer la réussite de ce défi qui, à mon sens, est aussi une 
opportunité unique pour vous de démontrer au monde entier l’ampleur des efforts que vous 
avez d’ores et déjà accomplis et la qualité de vos établissements.  
 
Un environnement réglementaire et économique toujours exigeant  pour les banques et 
les assurances 
Pour les banques, une nouvelle ère s’est ouverte le 1
er 
janvier 2014 avec l’entrée en vigueur 
officielle du « package » CRD4. Vous vous y êtes largement préparés en amont, en termes de 
solvabilité et de liquidité notamment. Mais ces adaptations doivent, bien entendu, être 
poursuivies cette année et tout au long du calendrier prévu.  
Dans cette perspective, il apparaît notamment indispensable que nous nous donnions les 
moyens de développer une titrisation déconsolidante des crédits immobiliers résidentiels ce 
qui conduira à revisiter l’équilibre économique de cette activité, marquée aujourd’hui en 
France par un niveau de taux particulièrement bas. 
 
Le travail normatif ne s’arrête pas avec CRD4 et de nombreux chantiers sont encore en 
cours. Au total, les efforts d’adaptation de votre part restent donc considérables. Sachez que 
j’en ai bien conscience, et que nous veillons autant que possible à ce que l’abondance de 
réglementations nouvelles remplisse bien son objectif premier, qui est de trouver le bon 
équilibre entre la robustesse du secteur financier et sa capacité à financer efficacement 
l’économie. Les ajustements actés à Bâle le week-end dernier, qui concernent non 
seulement le ratio de levier mais également les ratios de liquidité et de transformation, 
témoignent, je crois, de cette préoccupation. 
 
Pour le secteur de l’assurance, l’accord du trilogue sur Solvabilité 2 en novembre dernier a 
permis de clarifier les choses. Les mois qui viennent devraient être marqués par la 
finalisation des mesures de niveau 2, la publication de la directive Omnibus II, puis sa 
transposition en droit français.  
 
3 
 
La priorité pour 2014 est donc évidente : il faut poursuivre la préparation.  
L’ACPR y veillera d’ailleurs très concrètement :  
<U+F0B7> Dans le prolongement de ce qui a été fait en 2013, l’ensemble des organismes soumis 
au futur régime prudentiel seront sollicités pour participer à un exercice de collecte 
des états de reporting Solvabilité II, au format XBRL à partir de cette année ;  
<U+F0B7> Un exercice préparatoire à Solvabilité II sera également mené, au cours duquel les 
assureurs évalueront notamment leur conformité au regard des exigences de 
solvabilité, à la date d’entrée en application du nouveau régime (2016) ;  
<U+F0B7> En matière de gouvernance, la remise à l’autorité de contrôle d’un ORSA (own risk 
and solvency assessment) préparatoire en 2014 vous permettra de mettre en place 
un processus d’analyse des risques conforme aux recommandations d’EIOPA. Mais le 
plus important est devant nous avec le renforcement du corpus de règles régissant la 
gouvernance des établissements, point sur lequel la France est très décalée par 
rapport aux exigences de Solvabilité 2 et très en retard par rapport aux autres pays ;  
<U+F0B7> De la même manière, les travaux sur les modèles internes doivent continuer à 
avancer même si les candidatures ne seront examinées qu’en 2015 ; 
<U+F0B7> Ces dispositifs seront complétés par des tests de résistance orchestrés par EIOPA au 
printemps 2014. 
 
Au-delà de ces aspects réglementaires, l’environnement de taux durablement bas et de 
risques persistant, liés notamment au niveau de la reprise dans les principales économies, 
restera exigeant pour les banques et les assurances en 2014. Dans ce contexte, il convient 
donc de rester vigilant. En particulier, les établissements bancaires doivent poursuivre leurs 
efforts d’optimisation de leurs bases de coûts et les assureurs doivent rester attentifs à la 
maîtrise de leur rentabilité technique à travers une tarification prudente, notamment sur 
certaines branches d’assurances de particuliers (automobile, habitation) affectées par une 
dérive de la sinistralité. 
 
La Place sera associée en 2014 à plusieurs projets importants en lien avec le réseau de la 
Banque de France 
Comme vous le savez, la Banque a initié en 2013 un ambitieux programme de modernisation 
de son Réseau. Ce plan doit être largement concerté avec nos parties prenantes, pour 
qu’elles soient informées à l’avance, puissent faire des observations et disposent du temps 
nécessaire pour adapter leurs interfaces.  
 
Dans le domaine fiduciaire, cette concertation est déjà une réalité. Un groupe de place 
examine le conditionnement des billets et les normes de versement/ prélèvement à nos 
guichets et fait procéder à des tests. Dans le cadre d’une nouvelle approche logistique, il 
s’agit de favoriser partout où cela est possible l’automatisation des « process » physiques et 
informatiques et l’évolution vers des conditionnements rigides est incontournable dans 
cette perspective.  
Permettez-moi de dire un mot des nouvelles gammes de billets.  
4 
 
L’émission du nouveau billet de 5€, en mai 2013, a été globalement un succès. Le 
déploiement, à l’automne 2014, du 10 euros de la nouvelle série, qui représente en France 
plus de 20% du volume des billets en circulation et plus du tiers des flux, constitue un 
challenge plus important encore. La Banque de France a œuvré pour qu’une information soit 
délivrée plus en amont et que plus de temps soit donné à la filière fiduciaire pour procéder 
aux tests et adapter les machines et les automates.  
La réforme entreprise de notre réseau s'accompagnera également d'une transformation du 
traitement du surendettement des particuliers, qui implique un très grand nombre 
d'échanges avec les établissements de crédit. Ce traitement fera de plus en plus appel aux 
technologies numériques et à la dématérialisation de documents.  
Nous souhaitons bien évidemment que les solutions retenues dans ce cadre répondent de 
manière optimale aux besoins de l'ensemble de nos partenaires et donc, naturellement, de 
la communauté bancaire. C’est pourquoi nous initierons dans le courant de l'année 2014 une 
information de la place sur ce thème.  
 
Enfin, la Place devra, en 2014, saisir et accompagner les opportunités de croissance 
D’abord, le financement adéquat de la reprise économique sera absolument clé en 2014.  
J’observe comme vous avec satisfaction qu’en 2013, la France a été le seul grand pays 
d’Europe où le crédit bancaire s’est maintenu, notamment en faveur des PME. Il faut 
d’ailleurs mentionner l’action de la BPI, qui a contribué efficacement à ce résultat.  
Cela étant, le niveau reste bas et certains secteurs appellent régulièrement mon attention, 
comme la dynamique des crédits de trésorerie aux PME et ETI dont l’évolution au dernier 
trimestre est préoccupante avec une hausse significative des refus de nouveau crédit. Il est 
très important que les 3 millions de très petites entreprises disposent d’un accès approprié 
aux prêts bancaires. Je rappelle que, ensemble, elles représentent 20 % des effectifs salariés 
et de la valeur ajoutée en France. Pour mieux mesurer la situation à cet égard, la Banque de 
France étend d’ailleurs, en coopération avec la Fédération des Centres de gestion agréés, sa 
mesure trimestrielle des crédits au secteur des micro-entreprises.  
 
Il faut que l’ensemble des entreprises trouvent en 2014 les financements nécessaires pour 
leur développement et leur compétitivité. 
À cet égard, la Banque a activement contribué aux travaux de la place qui se sont déroulés 
en 2013 pour favoriser notamment le financement des ETI, en facilitant leur accès aux 
marchés de capitaux, aussi bien pour les besoins de court terme, à travers les billets de 
trésorerie, que pour les besoins de long terme, avec les placements privés, dont une charte, 
élaborée avec l’ensemble des parties prenantes, devrait très prochainement faciliter le 
développement.  
Par ailleurs, la Place s’est dotée, avec le soutien de la Banque de France, d’un véhicule 
simple, économique et sûr pour la titrisation des créances privées dont l’utilisation est de 
nature à faciliter le refinancement dans le marché et auprès de l’Eurosystème des crédits 
aux entreprises.  
 
5 
 
Afin de remplir cet objectif de financement approprié de l’économie, je ne peux 
qu’encourager également la Place à saisir en 2014 les opportunités de renforcement de ses 
infrastructures financières.  
Je pense tout particulièrement à la cession d’Euronext, qui ouvre la perspective d’une 
reprise par des investisseurs de long terme, soucieux de construire au sein de la zone euro 
une plateforme boursière qui, appuyée sur l’écosystème performant d’investisseurs, 
d’intermédiaires et de prestataires de services qu’offrent notamment les places de Paris et 
d’Amsterdam, sera en mesure de contribuer efficacement au financement et au 
développement de notre économie. 
Je pense en outre à la mise en place de l’accord de swap entre la BCE et la Banque populaire 
de Chine. La Banque de France l’a fortement appelé de ses vœux parce qu’il fournira un filet 
de sécurité en matière de liquidité en RMB aux banques de la zone euro. Il donnera 
l’opportunité à celles installées à Paris d’y développer pour la zone euro un centre de 
référence pour les services de financement, de placement et de règlement en RMB. À cet 
égard, il est important que la réflexion engagée sous l’égide de Paris Europlace, avec le 
soutien actif de la Banque de France, débouche rapidement sur des actions concrètes. 
 
Last but not least, je voudrais dire un mot d’une autre étape importante du renforcement de 
l’union économique et monétaire qui est en marche : le passage à SEPA. Je tiens à saluer le 
travail en amont des banques, qui ont, malgré cela, été confrontées à un afflux de demandes 
au cours de ces dernières semaines ; et à renouveler mon appel à la mobilisation de tous les 
acteurs concernés pour être prêts dans le délai initial du 1
er
 février. A cet égard, la période 
de transition proposée par la Commission doit permettre de traiter de façon ordonnée le cas 
de tous ceux qui ne seront pas prêts à temps - et je pense en particulier aux petites 
entreprises, aux associations et aux professions libérales qui affichent encore un retard -. 
Mais, comme vous le savez, ce n’est nullement un report de la date butoir et il est essentiel 
de ne pas relâcher l’effort et de tout faire pour finaliser un basculement intégral, sinon le 1
er
 
février, du moins dans les jours qui suivront.

Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
Voilà les priorités que je vois dans l’année à venir : l’Europe, le renforcement du système 
financier et le retour de la croissance. 
Je vous renouvelle mes vœux les meilleurs pour cette nouvelle année.

 rencontres parlementaires sur l’épargne - 29 janvier 2014 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
L’orientation et la mobilisation de l’épargne en 2014 
 
 
Je vous remercie de m’avoir invité à cette matinée de réflexion sur l’épargne, sujet ô 
combien clé pour l’économie française et européenne actuellement.  
Je voudrais vous donner quelques éléments de cadrage et quelques pistes de réflexion 
avant de répondre à vos questions.  
 
Comme vous le savez, le taux d’épargne des ménages en France est l’un des plus élevés de 
la zone euro, à 16 % du revenu disponible brut des ménages, contre 13 % en moyenne dans 
la zone euro.  
 
Où va cet argent ? La plus grande partie est investie dans l’immobilier. Le reste - un peu 
moins de 4 000 milliards d’euros - est réparti entre trois grands types de placements 
financiers : les contrats d’assurance-vie (environ 1 500 mds d’euros), les placements 
bancaires (1 300 mds) et les titres (1 150 mds). 4 000 milliards d’euros, donc deux fois le PIB 
annuel de la France, c’est évidemment énorme et cela constitue une source majeure de 
financement que les banques et les autres intermédiaires financiers doivent pouvoir mettre 
au service de l’économie, de la façon la plus efficace possible.  
 
Permettez-moi de faire un point sur chacun de ces placements.   
L’assurance-vie, d’abord, qui au sein du patrimoine financier des ménages, est donc le 
placement préféré des Français. Entre janvier et septembre 2013, la détention de ces 
contrats a augmenté de 32 milliards d’euros, soit 12 milliards d’euros de plus que sur 
l’ensemble de l’année 2012. C’est le seul placement financier dont la progression en 2013 a 
été plus forte qu’en 2012. 
 
A compter de 2014, les épargnants vont pouvoir disposer de nouveaux produits créés dans 
le cadre de la réforme de l’assurance-vie adoptée en décembre dernier. Ceux-ci devraient 
drainer une partie de l’épargne des ménages vers le financement de l’économie via la 
détention d'actions. Le nouveau contrat « vie-génération », en particulier, a pour vocation de 
financer les PME et les entreprises de taille intermédiaire.  
 
Néanmoins, l’apport de fonds que ces nouveaux contrats fourniront ne satisfera qu’une faible 
partie des besoins de financement des entreprises françaises car, en France, les PME se 
financent pour l’essentiel auprès des banques. C’est la raison pour laquelle il est essentiel 
que les banques disposent de ressources bon marché pour pouvoir en faire bénéficier leurs 
emprunteurs, et ce encore plus dans la situation actuelle de reprise économique fragile. Il 
faut que la politique monétaire extrêmement accommodante de la BCE puisse être 
répercutée dans le taux des crédits. 
 
Ceci m’amène au deuxième ensemble, les placements bancaires. Avec plus de 
1 240 milliards d’euros, ils représentent une source de fonds a priori très importante pour les 
banques. Mais en réalité, ces ressources sont souvent trop coûteuses en France. 
 
Ceci est dû au fait que les trois quarts de ces placements se composent de dépôts dont les 
taux de rémunération sont réglementés : livret A, livret de développement durable, comptes 
et plans épargne logement, etc.  
Par exemple, comme vous le savez, le taux de rémunération du livret A et du LDD, qui 
regroupent à eux seuls plus de 360 milliards d’euros détenus par les ménages à fin 
décembre 2013, se situe en ce début d’année à 1,25 %, niveau bien supérieur à celui des 
refinancements de l’Eurosystème, 0,25 %. En outre, ce taux détermine largement ceux des 
livrets librement rémunérés, pour des motifs commerciaux évidents. Son niveau élevé 
contribue donc en réalité à renchérir une grande partie des ressources bancaires et, in fine, 
se répercute sur le coût du crédit.  
 
Les ménages détiennent également des dépôts à terme, principalement sous la forme de 
plans épargne logement. Ces derniers, dont la rémunération est réglementairement d’au 
moins 2,5 %, indépendamment du coût de marché des ressources de durée comparable, ont 
davantage attiré l’épargne des ménages en 2013. En incluant la capitalisation des intérêts, 
leur encours a progressé de 9,5 milliards d’euros au cours de l’année passée. Cela n’est pas 
surprenant car les fonds déposés sur les PEL sont bloqués pour seulement deux ans et non 
soumis à l’impôt sur le revenu, alors que les intérêts obligataires le sont et que le taux des 
OAT à 10 ans s’est établi à 2,2 % en moyenne en 2013.  
 
Les ménages détiennent enfin des titres, principalement sous forme de parts d’OPCVM non 
monétaires ou d’actions non cotées, pour un encours total au troisième trimestre 2013 d’un 
peu plus de 1 150 milliards d’euros. La création au 1
er
 janvier 2014 du PEA PME et le 
relèvement du plafond des PEA pourraient attirer une partie de l’épargne des ménages vers 
le financement de l’économie et c’est une évolution qu’il faut soutenir.  
 
Ces initiatives, ainsi que d’autres comme le CICE et le nouveau pacte national pour la 
croissance, la compétitivité et l’emploi, devraient faciliter le financement des entreprises et 
contribuer à un rebond de l’investissement si nécessaire à une croissance plus robuste. En 
effet, outre l’effet bénéfique sur le coût du travail et donc la compétitivité des entreprises, ces 
mesures peuvent contribuer à restaurer la marge des entreprises, donc leur épargne 
(capacité d’autofinancement) et donc leur capacité à investir.  
 
Dans ce contexte global assez spécifique à la France, il apparaît utile de poursuivre la 
réflexion sur l’allocation de l’épargne et sur les conditions d’un équilibre entre quatre 
objectifs :  
- orienter une plus grande partie des placements des ménages vers le financement de 
l’innovation et de l’investissement qui aideront les entreprises françaises à être plus 
compétitives à l’échelle mondiale ; 
- permettre au système bancaire d’assurer dans les années à venir son rôle 
d’intermédiation au service du financement de l’économie, dans le contexte de 
normes internationales les conduisant à améliorer le rapport entre les crédits et les 
dépôts ; 
- assurer, après prise en compte de la fiscalité, une juste rémunération de l’épargne 
des ménages, qui soit fonction de la durée des placements et du risque encouru, 
comme c’est le cas dans tous les grands pays européens. Avec le vieillissement de la 
population, une bonne affectation de l’épargne sera demain l’une des clés de la 
croissance ; 
- Permettre une transmission normale de la politique monétaire de la BCE, en 
réduisant les entraves à cette transmission que constituent les réglementations 
étatiques des taux d’intérêt dont on peut d’ailleurs se demander si elles sont bien 
conformes aux règles de l’Union monétaire fixées par le traité.   
 
Concilier ces objectifs me semble à la fois possible et souhaitable. Je vous remercie de votre 
attention et suis prêt à répondre à vos questions.

Conférences Lamfalussy  
31 janvier 2014 - Hôtel Marriott Budapest  
« Le dilemme de l’euro : l’adopter ou pas ? » 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
« Pourquoi l’Union économique et monétaire a besoin d’une union bancaire » 
 
 
 
 
Chers Gouverneurs,  
Mesdames, Messieurs,  
 
Avant de commencer mon allocution, je voudrais remercier chaleureusement le gouverneur 
Matolcsy de m’avoir invité. Je souhaite également le féliciter, ainsi que la Magyar Nemzeti 
Bank, pour avoir organisé cette conférence tout à fait prestigieuse et d’un grand intérêt.  
 
Mon intervention est consacrée à l’avancée la plus récente de l’intégration européenne, à 
savoir l’union bancaire.  
 
Comme vous le savez, ces quatorze dernières années d’union monétaire ont apporté des 
avantages considérables :  
 le pouvoir d’achat de plus de 300 millions d’utilisateurs de la monnaie unique a été 
mieux protégé que jamais grâce à une inflation stable et modérée,  
 le risque de change entre les pays de la zone euro a été éliminé, ce qui contribue à 
soutenir la croissance et à maintenir la stabilité,  
 et la monnaie unique a simplifié et stimulé à la fois les échanges commerciaux et la 
mobilité du travail.  
 
2 
 
Toutefois, même avec ces atouts, la zone euro n’a pas réussi à échapper à la crise, et l’un 
des enseignements les plus importants de cette période est que l’union monétaire était 
insuffisamment complète et cohérente.  
 
En 2012, un consensus a été trouvé sur la manière de remédier à cette insuffisance. La 
solution était claire et nette : l’Europe devait avancer sur la voie d’une union bancaire.  
 
Permettez-moi de citer quelques raisons qui ont guidé ce choix. 
La crise de la zone euro, et en particulier les épisodes les plus sévères de perturbations du 
système bancaire, a révélé un certain nombre de faiblesses fondamentales au cœur de 
l’union monétaire.  
 
i) Premièrement, les problèmes rencontrés par certaines banques ont fortement pesé sur la 
situation budgétaire de leur pays d’origine, où l’État a dû intervenir pour leur porter secours. 
Cela a compromis la confiance des marchés dans la soutenabilité des dettes publiques en 
croissance rapide qui en découlaient, entraînant de fortes hausses des taux d’intérêt 
auxquels ces pays pouvaient emprunter sur le marché, comme, par exemple, dans le cas de 
l’Irlande. 
 
ii) Deuxièmement, on avait le sentiment que les pays connaissant une situation des finances 
publiques détériorée auraient des difficultés à renflouer leurs systèmes financiers respectifs 
en cas de problème. Cela s’est traduit par une perte de confiance généralisée et a entraîné 
une hausse des coûts d’emprunt supportés par les banques et les emprunteurs souverains, 
comme dans le cas de l’Italie. 
 
iii) En réponse à ces tensions, la Banque centrale européenne a pris des mesures sans 
précédent pour abaisser le coût de refinancement des banques, réduisant ses taux 
directeurs à des niveaux historiquement bas et fournissant de la liquidité à trois ans en 
quantité illimitée. Mais même ces mesures n’ont pas suffi à apaiser les tensions sur les 
marchés. Dans certains pays au moins, les décisions de politique monétaire n’ont en fait pas 
été intégralement transmises à l’économie réelle.  
 
Quelle était la cause de ces trois phénomènes largement responsables de l’aggravation de 
la crise dans la zone euro ? C’était le cercle vicieux qui s’était instauré entre la situation du 
secteur bancaire d’un pays et la perception de la qualité de crédit de l’emprunteur souverain. 
Et pourquoi ce cercle vicieux s’est-il instauré ? A cause de l’absence d’union bancaire : 
 
3 
 
 dans une union monétaire, les capitaux peuvent circuler librement et rapidement d’un 
pays à l’autre, ce qui peut accroître l’incidence potentielle des « paniques 
bancaires », à moins de disposer de mécanismes supranationaux efficaces en 
matière de surveillance, de résolution et de garantie des dépôts ;  
 aussi longtemps que la santé financière de la zone euro sera à la merci des 
problèmes rencontrés par l’un des pays membres, des interactions négatives risquent 
de se développer entre risque souverain et risque bancaire ; 
 en réalité, l’absence d’union bancaire a permis le développement d’un degré de 
fragmentation élevé au sein du système bancaire de la zone euro, ce qui a suscité 
des doutes quant à l’« unicité » de l’euro.  
 
La crise a ainsi clairement montré qu’un système financier uniformément sain était essentiel 
à la stabilité de l’ensemble de la zone euro et à une bonne transmission de la politique 
monétaire unique.  
 
Une fois tombés d’accord sur ce raisonnement, il a fallu proposer une solution concrète. La 
clé de l’ union bancaire pourrait se résumer dans cette phrase : l’objectif est de faire en sorte 
que les banques de la zone euro soient considérées comme des « banques de la zone 
euro » et non plus comme des banques « irlandaises », « allemandes » ou « italiennes ». En 
d’autres termes, l’objectif est de garantir que les conditions de crédit au sein de la zone ne 
dépendent pas de la localisation mais de la qualité de l’emprunteur ; c’est en fait ce que l’on 
doit attendre d’un marché financier efficace.   
 
Pour parvenir à ce résultat, il faut mettre trois éléments en place :  
• Une supervision fédérale des établissements assurant que les mêmes règles et les 
mêmes méthodes de contrôle sont appliquées partout. Un superviseur supranational est 
en effet mieux placé pour évaluer les risques inhérents aux activités transfrontières et 
donc pour protéger et encourager ces activités ; il n’est pas soumis à des biais nationaux 
qui risquent d’induire la tentation de « l’introversion économique ». Il est par conséquent 
plus crédible et permet de renforcer la stabilité et la confiance dans la zone ; 
• Un mécanisme unifié de résolution des crises bancaires, pour éviter que la gestion 
d’une crise importante repose sur un seul État ;  
• Un système unifié de garantie des dépôts, pour éviter les phénomènes de panique 
bancaire.  
 
Depuis un an, ces idées et ces paroles se sont transformées en actes concrets et l’Europe a 
prouvé qu’elle était capable de mettre en place rapidement des réformes en profondeur afin 
4 
 
de sortir renforcée de la crise. Permettez-moi de faire un point sur les progrès accomplis à 
ce jour sur la voie de l’union bancaire.  
 
Comme vous le savez, la supervision est le domaine dans lequel nous avons le plus 
progressé. Les chefs d’État européens ont approuvé le principe d’un mécanisme de 
surveillance unique fin 2012 et nous préparons actuellement activement sa mise en œuvre.  
Dès novembre, les principales banques de la zone euro seront contrôlées par un système 
fédéralisé placé sous l’égide de la BCE. Un Comité de supervision sera mis en place pour 
planifier et assumer les missions de surveillance confiées à la BCE, réaliser les travaux 
préparatoires et proposer des projets complets de décisions pour adoption par le Conseil des 
gouverneurs.  
Par ailleurs, l’ensemble du système bancaire européen, y compris la Hongrie bien entendu, 
sera supervisé sur la base d’un corpus réglementaire unique (Single Rulebook), qui a été 
élaboré par l’Autorité bancaire européenne. Il s’agit là d’une étape majeure vers un système 
bancaire européen plus unifié et cohérent, et donc plus robuste et plus efficace.  
La mise en place d’un Mécanisme de surveillance unique est donc en bonne voie. En 
octobre dernier, nous avons franchi une autre étape importante avec l’annonce par la BCE 
que les banques européennes seraient soumises à une évaluation complète des bilans 
avant la mise en place du MSU en novembre 2014.  
Cet exercice est actuellement en cours. Nous devons avoir conscience qu’il s’agit d’un 
exercice sans précédent : environ 130 banques participantes, dont 13 groupes bancaires 
français, représentant 85 % du total des actifs des banques européennes, seront soumises 
de façon simultanée à un examen exhaustif de la qualité de leurs actifs, qui sera mené selon 
une méthodologie commune. Cet exercice sera suivi de tests de résistance cet été.  
 
Cet exercice rigoureux a un triple objectif : 
 favoriser la transparence concernant la situation du système bancaire européen ; 
 mettre en œuvre les mesures correctrices nécessaires ; 
 et, enfin, renforcer la confiance. 
 
Il est certain que cet exercice constitue un défi. Mais je pense qu'il s'agit également d'une 
grande opportunité pour les banques européennes de montrer qu'elles ont assaini leurs 
bilans et qu'elles sont solides et crédibles. 
 
Comme vous le voyez, le MSU est en bonne voie et je suis certain qu'il sera opérationnel 
d'ici la fin de l'année, comme prévu. Ce bon résultat ne doit cependant pas nous faire oublier 
5 
 
que pour la pleine réussite de l'union bancaire, le MSU devra être complété par l'adoption 
d'un mécanisme de résolution unique. 
 
En effet, tout comme mes collègues de la BCE, je considère que le mécanisme de résolution 
unique constitue un autre pilier fondamental de l'union bancaire, parallèlement au MSU. 
Dans l'idéal, le MRU devrait comprendre trois éléments : un système unique, une autorité 
unique et un fonds de résolution bancaire unique. 
C'est la raison pour laquelle la BCE a constamment incité l'ensemble des parties concernées 
à continuer d’avancer sur la voie de l'adoption du MRU, qui devrait être en place d’ici à ce 
que le MSU devienne opérationnel. Vous le savez, un débat politique est actuellement en 
cours entre le Conseil des ministres de l'UE et le Parlement européen. 
 
La version du MRU sur laquelle les gouvernements européens se sont entendus à la fin de 
l'année dernière n'est pas idéale, en raison notamment de la longue période de transition 
qu'elle nécessite, qui pourrait nourrir des incertitudes. Mais ce qui importe avant tout, c'est 
que nous disposions d'un ensemble de règles communes claires concernant la résolution 
des crises bancaires. S'agissant du mécanisme lui-même, l'Europe a prouvé par le passé 
que, confrontée à une crise profonde, elle était capable d'accélérer les processus et de 
renforcer la solidarité. 
 
Mesdames et Messieurs, j'espère être parvenu à vous brosser un tableau d'ensemble clair et 
à jour des progrès réalisés vers l'union bancaire.  
 
Pour conclure, j'aimerais souligner combien cette évolution est essentielle au renforcement 
de notre union économique et monétaire. 
Je pense que la BCE a prouvé, au plus fort de la crise, qu'elle était totalement déterminée à 
soutenir l'euro. Les mesures que nous avons prises découlaient de notre conviction profonde 
que la monnaie unique constitue notre bien commun le plus précieux et qu'elle apporte 
d'énormes avantages sur le plan économique. Aujourd'hui, avec la construction d'une union 
bancaire, nous montrons qu'il s'agit d'un engagement à long terme. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention.

  « GIC Central Banking series » 
« La politique monétaire et les banques et la montée du protectionnisme à 
l’échelle mondiale » 
Paris, le 10 mars 2014 
 
 
Introduction par Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
Nous traversons une période délicate pour la définition de la politique économique. 
Comme nous l’avons constaté lors de la réunion du G20 à Sydney, les performances de 
l’économie mondiale sont contrastées et empreintes d’incertitude. Une question centrale 
consiste à déterminer si la politique monétaire a un rôle à jouer dans l’amélioration de la 
situation. 
 
À mon sens, la réponse est incontestablement « oui ». La politique monétaire doit rester 
active, une inflation durablement faible menaçant la réalisation de la stabilité des prix au 
sens où elle est communément définie aujourd’hui par toutes les grandes banques 
centrales. Toutes les banques centrales ne sont pas identiques et leurs objectifs, leurs 
missions et, bien entendu, les situations auxquelles elles sont confrontées sont 
relativement différentes. Pourtant, et c’est important de le noter, l’ensemble des 
économies avancées a convergé – au cours des dernières années – vers la même 
définition de la stabilité des prix, adoptée pour la première fois par l’Eurosystème 
en 2003 : un taux d’inflation « proche de 2 % » (et dans le cas de la zone euro : inférieur 
à, mais proche de 2 %).  
 
 2 
Je consacrerai l’essentiel de mon introduction à deux questions liées à cet objectif 
ambitieux : le bas niveau d’inflation et les stratégies visant à fournir des indications 
prospectives (forward guidance).  
 
Je débuterai par la faiblesse de l’inflation.  
 
Récemment, l’inflation a diminué dans l’ensemble des économies avancées (mais pas 
dans les économies émergentes). Son profil a été atypique par rapport aux précédents 
épisodes faisant suite à une récession. Ce repli a été particulièrement marqué dans la 
zone euro, passant de 2,7 % en 2011 à 0,8 % en décembre 2013. Récemment, les 
évolutions dans la zone euro ont commencé, en s’orientant à la baisse, à diverger de 
celles observées dans quelques-unes des autres économies avancées comme les 
États-Unis et le Canada.  
Les sources et les raisons d’une inflation si faible sont complexes et multiples. De 
nombreuses incertitudes subsistent. Des facteurs temporaires et mondiaux peuvent être 
à l’œuvre dans la zone euro, les prix à l’importation diminuant. Je pense également qu’il 
existe des forces plus permanentes et profondes qui font baisser l’inflation tant dans la 
zone euro qu’à l’échelon mondial.  
Les capacités de production inutilisées demeurent en effet importantes – le terme 
communément utilisé est « sous-utilisation » - dans la plupart des économies avancées, 
la demande n’ayant pas encore renoué avec ses niveaux antérieurs à la récession et les 
entreprises n’ayant pas, dès lors, recouvré leur pouvoir de fixation des prix.   
 
L‘inflation des matières premières s’est inscrite récemment sur une tendance baissière. 
Ce constat est valable aussi bien pour les prix de l’énergie que pour ceux des produits 
alimentaires. Les prix des matières premières ont une incidence au plan mondial et 
réagissent fortement à des modifications mineures de l’équilibre entre offre et demande. 
Ils agissent comme amplificateurs et comme facteurs de propagation des pressions 
désinflationnistes.  
 
 3 
Des facteurs défavorables - et des forces désinflationnistes - puissants découlent du 
processus de désendettement notamment dans la zone euro, en raison de l’importance 
du secteur bancaire et de l’ampleur de l’ajustement des bilans de ce secteur. Nous 
déployons tous nos efforts pour rétablir le canal du crédit bancaire dans la zone euro. 
Nous avons opéré une avancée considérable avec la création de l’Union bancaire et du 
MSU en moins de deux ans, réalisation sans précédent dans l’histoire européenne. En 
outre, le processus de redressement des bilans des banques est bien engagé dans la 
zone euro et nous veillerons à ce que le prochain examen de la qualité des actifs dissipe 
tous les doutes quant à la viabilité du secteur bancaire de la zone.  
 
En outre, pour la zone euro se pose la question du taux de change. Comme vous le 
savez tous, du point de vue de la politique monétaire, le taux de change n’est pas une 
variable, encore moins une cible. Mais il constitue à l’évidence un paramètre très 
important lorsque l’on examine la situation monétaire et financière globale. La récente 
appréciation de l’euro a exercé une forte incidence désinflationniste.  
 
Nous pourrions débattre encore longtemps des différentes causes du faible 
niveau d’inflation, mais je souhaiterais faire quelques remarques sur cette 
question essentielle pour nous en tant que banquiers centraux.  
Premièrement, faible inflation ne signifie pas déflation. De nombreux analystes et 
observateurs redoutant aujourd’hui une déflation dans la zone euro, il est utile de 
comprendre la différence. La déflation est un processus permanent et cumulatif 
de diminution de l’indice global des prix, alimenté par des anticipations négatives. 
La déflation est une spirale pernicieuse. Comme les consommateurs attendent 
que les prix diminuent continûment, ils ont tendance à différer leurs achats, 
alimentant ainsi davantage encore le processus. La déflation alourdit la charge 
réelle de la dette et crée une incitation à différer l’investissement. Elle est 
particulièrement dangereuse car, comme le montre l’expérience du Japon, une 
fois installée, elle est très difficile à enrayer. De ce point de vue, il n’y a pas

actuellement de déflation dans la zone euro. Les prix, et surtout les salaires 
nominaux, continuent d’augmenter. Et, je le répète les anticipations d’inflation 
demeurent fermement ancrées en territoire positif, même à court terme. 
 
Deuxièmement, une faible inflation a un effet stimulant sur l’économie car elle 
accroît le revenu réel. Dans la plupart des pays de la zone euro, les salaires 
nominaux présentent une rigidité à la baisse. Chaque fois que l’inflation diminue 
« par surprise », elle entraîne une augmentation inattendue des salaires réels et 
du pouvoir d’achat. J’ai la conviction que ce mécanisme contribue à améliorer le 
climat des affaires et à soutenir la consommation, comme nous avons pu 
l’observer dans la zone euro au cours des derniers mois. 
 
Cela dit, une inflation trop basse comporte des dangers et des risques très 
significatifs.  
 
Premièrement, elle rend l’ajustement réel plus compliqué. Une faible inflation 
réduit la marge de manœuvre nécessaire pour un ajustement à la baisse des prix 
relatifs et des salaires réels. Comme vous le savez déjà, ces ajustements sont 
absolument nécessaires dans la zone euro pour permettre à certains pays, dont 
la France, de regagner de la compétitivité. Ce serait certainement plus facile si le 
taux d’inflation dans l’ensemble de la zone euro restait plus proche de notre 
définition de la stabilité des prix. 
 
Deuxièmement, une faible inflation permet difficilement de parvenir aux taux 
d’intérêt réels bas, voire négatifs, dont les économies avancées ont toutes besoin 
à l’heure actuelle. 
 
 5 
Enfin, une faible inflation accroît le risque que l’économie soit véritablement en déflation 
si jamais elle subit un choc négatif. La cible de 2 % est censée maintenir une marge la 
protégeant contre ce risque. Or, pour l’instant, la zone euro ne dispose pas de cette 
marge. Si cette situation persiste, elle peut s’avérer dangereuse dans un contexte 
économique très incertain. 
 
En résumé, la situation actuelle nécessite une évaluation très attentive de la balance 
des risques. C’est précisément parce que le processus de déflation est difficile à 
inverser que même les faibles probabilités qu’il se déclenche ne doivent pas être 
négligées et qu’il convient de les prendre pleinement en compte dans l’élaboration de la 
politique économique.  
 
Je souhaiterais à présent évoquer l’un des outils auxquels de nombreuses banques 
centrales dans le monde ont eu recours récemment pour faire face à une très faible 
inflation, à savoir la forward guidance. 
 
Les banques centrales communiquent depuis longtemps sur leur vision de l’avenir ainsi 
que sur leurs préoccupations et leurs intentions. La forward guidance, cependant, va 
plus loin. Premièrement, elle suppose un certain degré d’engagement sur les mesures 
qui seront prises dans le futur. Et, deuxièmement, elle élargit le champ de 
communication. Les banques centrales tentent de préciser la manière dont elles se 
comporteront à l’avenir, ce que nous qualifions de « fonction de réaction » dans notre 
jargon. L’hypothèse est que cette réaction sera différente de celle à laquelle on pourrait 
s’attendre lorsqu’on observe leur comportement passé ou les règles communément 
admises (Taylor).  
 
La forward guidance soulève plusieurs questions. 
Premièrement, quel doit être son degré de précision ? Le dilemme est évident. Si 
l’engagement est inconditionnel, il influera de manière très efficace sur les taux attendus 
à court terme, donc sur le profil de la courbe des rendements et, finalement, sur les taux 
à long terme. En revanche, il peut nuire à la crédibilité de la banque centrale si les 
 6 
circonstances changent et ne justifient plus qu’il soit respecté. En revanche, si les 
indications fournies sont conditionnelles, elles auront une incidence moindre et 
introduiront de la volatilité, les marchés réévaluant constamment la situation 
économique et la probabilité que la banque centrale modifie sa politique. 
 
Deuxièmement, si les banques centrales optent pour une forward guidance 
conditionnelle, celle-ci doit-elle dépendre de contraintes temporelles, c’est-à-dire faire 
référence à des périodes et à des dates précises pour les mesures futures, ou doit-elle 
dépendre de la situation économique ?  
Une forward guidance dépendant de contraintes temporelles risquerait d'être sapée par 
les évolutions de la situation économique. Une forward guidance dépendant des 
conditions économiques observées pourrait sembler plus adaptée. L'expérience montre 
toutefois qu’elle est également plus complexe à gérer, notamment lors du choix des 
« déclencheurs » ou des « seuils » attachés aux engagements pour l'avenir. En partie à 
cause de la crise, des transformations structurelles majeures sont en cours dans la 
plupart des économies avancées. Globalement, la relation entre les principales variables 
macroéconomiques devient instable, ce qui rend difficile le calibrage de la politique 
monétaire en fonction d'un nombre limité de paramètres, tels que le taux de chômage 
par exemple. En zone euro, ces changements sont indéniablement plus profonds 
qu’ailleurs, avec des transformations structurelles qui ont lieu à un rythme accéléré en 
raison de la crise et des politiques d'ajustement mises en œuvre dans les États 
membres. 
 
Nous avons dressé le bilan de toutes ces expériences et de tous ces enseignements 
lorsque nous avons conçu notre approche en matière de forward guidance dans la zone 
euro. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a explicitement indiqué dans ses communications 
qu’il prévoyait que les taux directeurs resteraient à leurs niveaux actuels ou à des 
niveaux inférieurs sur une période prolongée. Nous avons choisi de ne pas préciser de 
date ou de conditions détaillées. La zone euro se compose d'économies diverses et, 
dans une certaine mesure, hétérogènes, comme le dénotent les différences importantes 
entre les taux de chômage. Et, comme je l'ai souligné, elle connaît une phase de 
 7 
transformation structurelle rapide. Les relations entre les principales variables 
économiques sont par conséquent très complexes et incertaines, et lier les mesures de 
politique monétaire à un ensemble de dates ou de paramètres prédéterminés se serait 
dans doute révélé particulièrement délicat. Jusqu'à présent, notre forward guidance a 
permis de stabiliser la partie courte de la courbe des rendements, rendant ainsi possible 
une orientation très accommodante de la politique monétaire. 
 
 
Quelques remarques en conclusion  
 
Permettez-moi de conclure par deux remarques générales, sur l'avenir et sur les limites 
de la politique monétaire. 
Pour l’avenir, après de nombreuses années de mise en œuvre de politiques non 
conventionnelles, on peut se demander si les banques centrales renoueront un jour 
avec le cadre qui était le leur avant la crise. Le ciblage de l'inflation appartient-il au 
passé et les politiques non conventionnelles constituent-elles la nouvelle norme ? Je 
peux seulement vous présenter quelques hypothèses. 
 
Si le cadre qui prévalait avant la crise a subi des transformations, peut-être irréversibles, 
il a également, à certains égards, été renforcé : l'ensemble des banques centrales a 
maintenant adopté un objectif quantitatif de stabilité des prix ; chacun est conscient qu'il 
est essentiel que les mandats soient mis en œuvre de façon symétrique ; chacun met un 
accent de plus en plus prononcé sur la communication comme moyen d'exercer une 
influence sur les conditions monétaires et financières. 
 
Ce qui a sans doute changé de façon définitive, c'est la manière dont la politique 
monétaire opère par une diversité d’outils. Il est très peu probable que les banques 
centrales reviennent à l’avenir à l’utilisation d’un seul outil, à savoir, le taux d'intérêt à 
court terme. Les frictions financières devront être prises en compte, en particulier 
s'agissant du mécanisme de transmission. De plus, nous savons maintenant que la 
borne zéro des taux d'intérêt ne constitue pas une simple curiosité intellectuelle mais 
 8 
peut réellement poser une contrainte à la politique monétaire. Cela signifie qu'il pourrait 
être nécessaire d'utiliser plusieurs instruments de façon simultanée, y compris dans le 
domaine macroprudentiel. La fourniture de liquidité devrait jouer un rôle central dans la 
conduite de la stratégie dans l'Eurosystème pendant encore un certain temps.  
 
Deuxièmement, j'ai plaidé en faveur d'une politique monétaire active lorsque l'inflation 
atteint des niveaux dangereusement bas. Mais il existe toujours le risque d’attendre trop 
de la politique monétaire et de la solliciter excessivement. Il faut garder à l'esprit que la 
politique monétaire ne peut, à elle seule, renforcer la croissance. Elle présente par 
ailleurs des rendements décroissants. Plus la période au cours de laquelle les taux 
d'intérêt sont maintenus à de bas niveaux est longue, plus les risques pesant sur la 
stabilité financière sont importants.  
Les conditions monétaires actuellement accommodantes devraient servir à créer un 
environnement propice à la croissance à long terme. Un message très clair est ressorti 
de la dernière réunion du G20.  La politique économique doit tendre à relever le taux 
d'intérêt d'équilibre en favorisant les opportunités d'investissement productif, en 
modernisant les infrastructures et en améliorant la qualité des dépenses publiques, ce 
qui ne peut être réalisé qu'en mettant en œuvre des réformes globales, tant des 
marchés de biens que du marché du travail. En définitive, la croissance ne pourra être 
durablement rétablie que par des mesures vigoureuses et déterminées. Nous avons là 
une occasion qu’il nous faut saisir.

PRÉSENTATION DU RAPPORT ANNUEL 
DE L’AUTORITE DE CONTRÔLE PRUDENTIEL ET DE RÉSOLUTION POUR 2013 
Paris, le 23 mai 2014 
Discours de Christian Noyer, 
Gouverneur de la Banque de France et 
Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution 
 
Mesdames, Messieurs, 
 
Bienvenue dans l’espace conférence de la Banque de France à l’occasion de la présentation 
du rapport d’activité de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution pour l’année 2013. 
 
Je souhaite tout d’abord rendre un hommage à Jérôme HAAS, président de l’Autorité des 
normes comptables, qui est récemment décédé. C’était un membre très actif du collège de 
l’ACPR, participant à plusieurs de ses formations. Il nous a apporté une contribution 
remarquable, grâce à sa vaste expérience, sa grande finesse d’analyse et de jugement qui 
ont été des éléments particulièrement précieux pour assurer la qualité de l’action de l’ACPR. 
 
L’ACPR, autorité administrative indépendante adossée à la Banque de France, a connu et 
mis en œuvre d’importantes évolutions au cours de l’année passée. Comme son 
changement de nom en témoigne, l’ACPR a reçu de nouvelles attributions, et notamment un 
rôle central dans la résolution des groupes bancaires en difficulté. Par ailleurs, nous 
mesurons tous l’importance des réformes en cours au niveau européen et qui contribuent à 
faire évoluer la supervision du secteur des assurances et du secteur bancaire. Ces 
évolutions renforcent les grandes missions imparties à l’ACPR : préserver la stabilité du 
système financier, assurer la protection des clients, des assurés et des adhérents, et porter 
la voix de la France dans les négociations internationales relevant de son champ de 
2 
 
compétence. Mais elles vont aussi modifier en profondeur le mode d’exercice de ses 
missions, je pense aux différents volets de l’Union bancaire en cours de mise en place. 
 
Je souhaite donc tout d’abord revenir sur les multiples changements réglementaires 
intervenus au cours de l’année 2013 et leur mise en œuvre par l’Autorité. J’évoquerai ensuite 
la solidité des établissements bancaires et des organismes d’assurance français qui, au 
cours de l’année 2013, ont obtenu des résultats financiers satisfaisants et renforcé leur 
solvabilité. Enfin, je reviendrai sur l’organisation et le fonctionnement de l’ACPR. 
 
Jean-Marie Levaux, vice-président de l’ACPR, complétera mon intervention sur des thèmes 
plus spécifiques aux assureurs. 
 
I. En 2013, l’Autorité, s’est assurée de la bonne mise en œuvre de multiples 
changements réglementaires 
Les nombreuses évolutions réglementaires intervenues l’an passé peuvent se regrouper en 
trois ensembles distincts. La loi du 26 juillet 2013 de séparation et de régulation des 
activités bancaires a confié de nouvelles missions à l’ACPR. Au sein de la zone euro, 
l’Union bancaire a commencé à prendre forme. Enfin, la mise en œuvre des nouvelles 
normes prudentielles, Solvabilité II, CRR/CRD4 et EMIR a mobilisé les équipes de 
l’Autorité. 
 
La loi du 26 juillet 2013 a singulièrement renforcé les missions de  l’ACPR. Elle l’a, en 
premier lieu, chargée de veiller à l'élaboration et à la mise en œuvre des mesures de 
prévention et de résolution des crises bancaires. Cette évolution est le prolongement 
naturel des missions confiées à l’Autorité à sa création en 2010 puisqu’à travers la résolution 
il s’agit de préserver la stabilité financière, d'assurer la continuité des activités, des services 
et des opérations des établissements dont la défaillance aurait de graves conséquences 
pour l'économie, de protéger les déposants, d'éviter ou de limiter au maximum le recours au 
soutien financier public. 
 
 En raison des spécificités de cette nouvelle compétence, l’ACPR  dispose désormais d’une 
direction spécialisée et d’un collège dédié à la résolution qui a tenu sa première réunion en 
novembre 2013. Ce collège validera les plans préventifs de rétablissement établis par les 
établissements et, le cas échéant, prendra les mesures nécessaires à la résolution ordonnée 
des situations de crise, telles que la création d’une banque relai ou l’appel au fonds de 
garantie et de résolution. Par ailleurs, cette loi prévoit que certaines activités de marché 
devront à l’avenir être cantonnées dans des filiales dédiées. L’ACPR est chargée de mettre 
3 
 
en œuvre ce principe, en tant qu’autorité d’agrément et de contrôle de ces futures filiales et 
de leur groupe bancaire. Enfin, la loi a renforcé les pouvoirs de l’Autorité en matière de 
contrôle de la gouvernance. Elle est en charge de la vérification des conditions de 
compétence et d’expérience des dirigeants ainsi que des membres des conseil 
d’administration et de surveillance dans les entités des secteurs bancaire et assurance. 
 
Comme la loi bancaire de juillet 2013, l’Union bancaire tire les leçons de la crise financière 
que nous avons traversée. En rompant le lien entre risque souverain et risque bancaire, elle 
a rétabli la confiance des investisseurs dans les dettes des États membres de la zone euro. 
L’année 2013 a été celle de la négociation et de l’adoption du règlement de l’UE instaurant le 
Mécanisme de supervision unique (MSU) adossé à la BCE. Le 16 décembre 2013, 
Danièle Nouy, alors Secrétaire générale de l’ACPR a été nommée à la Présidence du 
Conseil de surveillance du MSU. La création du MSU a fortement mobilisé les équipes 
de l’ACPR en 2013. La BCE s’est appuyée sur l’expertise des autorités nationales pour 
établir le futur cadre européen de supervision et rédiger un « manuel de supervision » qui 
sera commun à toutes les autorités de contrôle de la zone euro. Des données relatives à la 
structure du système bancaire français et aux principaux risques auxquels sont exposées les 
banques jugées significatives, ont été collectées. Des agents de l’ACPR ont été détachés à 
Francfort dès la fin de l’année 2013. En 2014, ces travaux de préparation s’intensifient 
encore afin de permettre au MSU d’être pleinement opérationnel dès novembre 2014. 
 
Au cours de l’année 2013, l’ACPR a également préparé la mise en œuvre des grands textes 
réformant les activités financières dans le secteur de l’assurance - avec Solvabilité 2 -, de la 
banque - avec la transposition des mesures de Bâle III par les textes européens CRR et 
CRD4 - et des marchés - avec la règlementation EMIR des produits dérivés et des chambres 
de compensation -.  
 
Concernant Solvabilité II, les équipes de l’ACPR ont agi pour favoriser la finalisation 
de ce projet dans les meilleures conditions. Elles ont apporté leur contribution aux 
discussions sur la Directive amendant le texte de Solvabilité II dite « Omnibus II ». Elles se 
sont également investies au sein de l’EIOPA dans l’étude d’impact sur les branches longues 
et les travaux sur les textes d’orientations (souvent désignés par leur nom anglais de 
guidelines). Au plan national, l’Autorité a veillé à la préparation du marché en demandant dès 
2013 aux organismes de remettre des documents établis dans le nouveau référentiel 
prudentiel. 
 
4 
 
Dans le domaine bancaire, l’ACPR a préparé l’application des évolutions introduites 
par le paquet CRR/CRD4, adopté le 26 juin 2013. Les exigences de solvabilité, de liquidité 
et de limitation du levier ont fait l’objet d’études quantitatives récurrentes, la trajectoire des 
principaux groupes étant suivie avec attention par les équipes de l’ACPR. Le changement de 
définition de la notion d’établissement de crédit a fait l’objet d’un suivi spécifique à l’occasion 
de l’adoption de l’ordonnance du 27 juin 2013 relative aux établissements de crédit et aux 
sociétés de financement, nouveau statut pour lequel les actuelles sociétés financières 
peuvent opter. 
 
Les modalités d’application des mesures macro-prudentielles prévues par les accords de 
Bâle III notamment sous forme de coussins de fonds propres ont également fait l’objet de 
travaux, en lien avec la Banque de France, le Conseil européen du risque systémique et le 
Comité de Bâle. Enfin, par la loi du 26 juillet 2013, le législateur a confié à l’ACPR 
certaines prérogatives dans l’application du Règlement du 4 juillet 2012 sur les produits 
dérivés de gré à gré, les contreparties centrales et les référentiels centraux dit « Règlement 
EMIR ». L’ACPR, la Banque de France et l’AMF ont étroitement collaboré tout au long de 
l’année pour assurer la mise en œuvre opérationnelle de ce texte ce qui a en particulier 
permis à LCH-Clearnet SA d’obtenir il y a quelques jours son agrément EMIR. 
 
Ces différents textes sont intervenus dans un environnement plus favorable pour les 
établissements bancaires et les organismes d’assurance. 
 
II. Malgré un contexte macroéconomique qui reste difficile, les établissements 
bancaires et les organismes d’assurance actifs en France ont obtenu des 
résultats assez satisfaisants et renforcé leur solvabilité. 
 
Après six trimestres de récession (entre 2012 et début 2013), la zone euro a amorcé une 
timide reprise à partir du deuxième trimestre 2013 qui masque toutefois des disparités 
entre les pays membres. La reprise reste fragile alors que l’assainissement des comptes 
publics se poursuit, mais la zone euro devrait toutefois renouer progressivement avec le 
chemin de la croissance. 
 
Dans ce contexte, la solvabilité des emprunteurs aurait pu se dégrader, pour les ménages, 
en raison d’un chômage élevé et, pour les entreprises, de la faiblesse de l’activité, ce qui 
aurait accru le coût du risque dans un contexte où la faible demande de crédit des 
entreprises pesait sur l’évolution du produit net bancaire. 
 
5 
 
Quant aux organismes d’assurance, ils auraient pu être pénalisés par  la prolongation 
d’une situation de taux bas qui effrite graduellement le rendement des actifs et ne stimule 
pas une collecte abondante en assurance vie. 
 
Ces risques ne se sont pas matérialisés et les principaux groupes de banque et d’assurance, 
actifs en France ont publié des résultats mondiaux consolidés satisfaisants qui ont permis de 
maintenir ou d’améliorer leur solvabilité. 
 
Ainsi, les six principaux groupes bancaires ont obtenu un résultat net part du groupe (RNPG) 
de 18 milliards d’euros, plus de deux fois supérieur à celui de 2012 (8,4 milliards d’euros). 
Tout en maintenant une relative stabilité de leurs risques pondérés (+0,4 %), ces groupes 
ont continué de renforcer leurs fonds propres « durs », comme l’illustre la progression de 
4,9 % des fonds propres Core Tier 1 agrégés entre fin 2012 et fin 2013. Selon les standards 
de la directive européenne transposant Bâle III (CRD4) et abstraction faite des mesures de 
phasage, chacun de ces 6 groupes a atteint un ratio de solvabilité supérieur ou égal à 10 % 
(« ratio full CRD4 »). 
 
Les banques françaises participent aujourd’hui à l’exercice d’évaluation des bilans, qui sera 
complété par des stress tests coordonnés au niveau européen. Cet exercice, d’une ampleur 
inédite, qui mobilise l’ACPR et des cabinets extérieurs, permettra, j’en suis sûr, de renforcer 
la confiance dans le système bancaire français car compte tenu de leurs bonnes 
performances, les groupes français abordent cet exercice avec sérénité. 
 
Les organismes d’assurance ont également connu une année 2013 positive. Les assurances 
de personnes ont en particulier bénéficié du retour à une collecte nette positive en assurance 
vie. La collecte nette s’est ainsi élevée à plus de 11 milliards d’euros, supports euros et UC 
confondus. Par ailleurs, la rentabilité d’exploitation des groupes français qui ont publié leurs 
comptes est en forte hausse, tirée par la baisse des ratios combinés de l’assurance de biens 
et de responsabilités ; Jean-Marie Levaux y reviendra. 
 
L’ACPR suit avec attention l’évolution de la situation des établissements et organismes 
placés sous sa surveillance. Vous trouverez ainsi les évolutions de l’année 2013 dans des 
numéros d’Analyses et synthèses publiés en même temps que le rapport d’activité.

III. Pour remplir ses missions, l’ACPR a fait preuve en 2013 de vigilance, de 
dynamisme, d’adaptabilité et de répression lorsque cela s’est avéré nécessaire 
 
L’approche de l’ACPR se traduit dans la réalisation des priorités du contrôle. L’objectif d’une 
analyse du profil de risque de tous les assujettis sur un rythme au moins annuel a été 
atteint : les comptes et la stratégie de 1394 établissements et organismes ont été 
étudiés par l’ACPR en 2013. L’intégralité du programme de contrôle sur place validé par le 
collège a été réalisée. Ces 253 missions se sont réparties à 60 % dans le secteur bancaire 
et à 40 % dans le secteur assurantiel. 
 
La préparation à l’entrée en vigueur du paquet CRR/CRD4 et de Solvabilité II a été au cœur 
des préoccupations du contrôle permanent et des contrôles sur place. Dans le domaine 
bancaire, une attention particulière a été accordée aux structures de refinancement et à 
l’évolution du risque de crédit ; les contrôleurs sur place ont étudié également avec précision 
le financement des LBO, les crédits aux PME et à l’habitat ainsi que les risques juridiques 
attachés aux emprunts « toxiques » des collectivités locales et aux contributions à la fixation 
des indices de marché. Dans le domaine assurantiel, le contrôle permanent s’est investi 
dans l’amélioration de la qualité et du respect des délais des transmissions des états 
réglementaires et dans la préparation à Solvabilité II. En banque, comme en assurance, le 
contrôle des pratiques commerciales est pleinement intégré aux autres formes de 
contrôles. Ainsi, 90 contrôles sur place ont été menés en 2013 dans le cadre de la 
protection de la clientèle. Des outils spécifiques ont également été mobilisés: ainsi près de 
4 200 publicités ont été analysées l’an passé et près de 4 800 demandes et réclamations ont 
été reçues et traitées. Enfin, le contrôle des pratiques commerciales donne lieu à une 
coopération fructueuse avec l’AMF, institutionnalisée dans un pôle commun. 
 
Ce même esprit de vigilance et dynamisme caractérise l’action de l’ACPR en matière de 
travaux d’études. En lien avec les directions du contrôle, le suivi transversal des risques et 
les stress tests va se retrouver au cœur de l’élaboration des programmes de contrôles avec 
CRD4 et Solvabilité 2, lesquels préconisent d’adapter le processus de supervision au profil 
de risque des établissements et aux risques qu’ils font courir au marché, notamment pour les 
établissements systémiques. 
 
L‘action de l’ACPR est d’abord préventive. Mais elle doit aussi être répressive lorsque c’est 
nécessaire. L’ensemble des pouvoirs en matière de niveau de fonds propres bancaires, de 
mise en demeure (souvent sur des sujets d’organisation de procédures de contrôle des 
risques) ou de dossiers soumis à la commission des sanctions. En 2013, celle-ci a ainsi 
7 
 
rendu dix décisions à l’égard d’entités des secteurs bancaire et assurantiel. Elle a 
notamment prononcé sept blâmes et un avertissement, assortis de huit sanctions 
pécuniaires. 
 
Une supervision financière efficace exige également une forte présence à l’international. 
Cela est nécessaire pour peser sur les évolutions réglementaires et suivre 
l’internationalisation croissante des marchés de la banque et de l’assurance. L’ACPR 
possède une forte présence dans les groupes de travail européens et internationaux : 
en 2013 ses représentants ont participé à 258 groupes ou sous-groupes de travail et présidé 
25 groupes, que ce soit dans le cadre de l’EIOPA et de l’IAIS pour les assurances ou de 
l’EBA, du Comité de Bâle et de la BCE dans le domaine bancaire. Par ailleurs, les services 
du contrôle représentent l’ACPR aux collèges de superviseurs réunissant les autorités 
nationales de contrôle impliqués dans la supervision d’un même groupe bancaire ou 
assurantiel. 
 
Dans tous ces travaux, l’ACPR démontre ses capacités d’adaptabilité aux évolutions 
constantes qui touchent son champ d’action, qu’elles proviennent des changements 
réglementaires et institutionnels ou de la créativité des acteurs financiers. Je n’ai pas, par 
exemple, cité ici les travaux de l’ACPR sur le financement participatif (crowdfunding) ou sur 
la question des monnaies locales et virtuelles (bitcoins). Ainsi, en 2010, l’ACP avait réussi en 
quelques mois à intégrer en une seule entité le contrôle bancaire, le contrôle des 
assurances, la délivrance des autorisations et des agréments et le contrôle des pratiques 
commerciales. 
 
2014 sera à l’évidence une année charnière avec la mise en place effective de l’Union 
bancaire. Parallèlement à la réalisation, pour le compte de la BCE, du l’évaluation complète 
du système bancaire français ayant vocation à passer sous supervision directe BCE, 
exercice d’ampleur sans précédent qui combine une revue très détaillée de la qualité des 
actifs et une simulation de l’incidence d’un scénario de crise, l’ACPR se prépare activement 
à l’intégration de ses activités de contrôle bancaire au sein d’un MSU fondée sur une 
convergence des méthodes de contrôle. L’ACPR va aussi prendre en compte dans son 
organisation le vote récent par le Parlement européen de la directive sur le 
Rétablissement et la Résolution des banques et surtout de la directive sur le Mécanisme 
de résolution unique (MRU) qui conduira à la mise en place d’un conseil européen de 
résolution, en principe avant la fin de 2014. A la lumière de ce que l’ACPR a réalisé au cours 
des 4 dernières années, je suis pleinement confiant dans sa capacité, sous la houlette de 
8 
 
son nouveau secrétaire général, Edouard Fernandez-Bollo, à faire face à ces nouveaux 
défis. 
 
L’importance des transformations en cours dans la supervision bancaire, ne doit pas 
masquer l’important travail réalisé dans le cadre de la supervision des assurances. Je tiens à 
éviter cet écueil, c’est pourquoi je cède la parole à ce propos à M. Levaux, Vice-président de 
l’ACPR qui développera ce point. Puis Rémi Bouchez, Président de la commission des 
sanctions, vous présentera un bilan de l’activité des sanctions en 2013 et en ce début 
d’année 2014. 
 
Je vous remercie pour votre attention.

Forum Économique International des Amériques 
Conférence de Montréal - Lundi 9 juin 2014 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer - Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
C’est toujours un privilège de prendre la parole aux côtés de Larry mais c’est également un défi et je 
vais tenter de le relever en me référant souvent aux idées qu'il a lancées, particulièrement au cours des 
derniers mois. Je vais aborder trois questions : La crise de l’euro est-elle terminée ? L’Europe est-elle 
confrontée à la perspective d’une décennie perdue ? Quels défis à court terme devons-nous relever 
aujourd’hui ? 
 
I / La crise de l’euro est-elle terminée ? 
 
Il y a moins de deux ans, la question, pour l'euro, était celle de son existence même, de la possibilité 
d'éviter la désagrégation et l'implosion de la zone. Aujourd'hui nous sommes dans un autre univers. Les 
europessimistes - et il en reste- ne doutent plus de la survie de l'euro. Ils s'interrogent sur la capacité de 
l’Europe à produire de la croissance. Le défi est important, mais il est différent. C'est la politique macro 
économique et financière qui est en cause et non plus l'existence la monnaie unique. 
 
Signe le plus visible de ce changement, les conditions financières se normalisent. Grâce, 
principalement, aux mesures prises par l’Eurosystème, les écarts de taux d'intérêt entre pays du ""cœur"" 
et de la périphérie se sont considérablement réduits. Des progrès importants ont été réalisés dans le 
rétablissement des finances publiques, de sorte que  les politiques et situations  budgétaires cesseront 
bientôt de peser négativement sur la croissance. La position financière des ménages et des entreprises 
est globalement saine. Les prévisions récentes tablent sur une croissance supérieure à 2 % en 
Allemagne, redevenue positive en Italie et les perspectives se sont sensiblement améliorées pour la 
France. En avril, la croissance de l’activité dans la zone euro a atteint son plus haut niveau depuis trois 
ans. 
Mais la crise a laissé des séquelles importantes : 
 
2 
 
<U+F0A7> Les marchés monétaires et financiers demeurent fragmentés. La transmission de la politique 
monétaire à l'intérieur de la zone reste perturbée. Les emprunteurs sont confrontés à des 
conditions de crédit très différentes selon le pays ou le secteur dans lesquels ils opèrent.  
<U+F0A7> les banques poursuivent l’ajustement de leurs bilans, avec, à court terme, des conséquences 
négatives pour la croissance. Le crédit bancaire stagne dans l’ensemble de la zone euro ce qui 
pénalise particulièrement le financement des PME, notamment dans les pays où subsistent des 
tensions financières.  
 
Nous avons pleinement conscience que l'assainissement des bilans bancaires est une condition 
préalable à la reprise du crédit et l'efficacité de la politique monétaire. Nous avons donc attaqué ce 
problème de front.  
 
1. Nous bâtissons un système d’intermédiation financière plus sûr et plus robuste. La création 
d’une union bancaire a constitué une étape décisive. Comme vous le savez, il s'agit d'abord de 
créer, au niveau de la zone euro, un mécanisme commun et rigoureux de supervision financière, 
ce qui permet, à l'intérieur de la zone euro, de rompre le lien pervers entre les États et leurs 
banques, entre le risque bancaire et le risque souverain. C'est un pas en avant  remarquable dans 
la construction européenne, dont il ne faut pas sous estimer l’importance. Moins de deux ans se 
sont écoulés entre la décision de principe et la mise en œuvre du mécanisme  unique de 
supervision. Jamais, dans l'histoire de l'Union Européenne, autant de progrès ont été réalisés en 
aussi peu de temps.  
2. Parallèlement, nous avons lancé une revue complète et approfondie de la qualité des actifs 
bancaires, couplée à des tests de résistance des banques à des conditions macro économiques 
extrêmes. Ces exercices seront réalisés  selon une méthodologie rigoureuse et harmonisée, dans 
des conditions de totale transparence, sous l’égide du MSU. Tous les doutes et incertitudes sur 
la santé financière des banques seront levés, marquant un tournant important et levant une 
hypothèque à la reprise normale du crédit.   
3. À plus long terme, un défi majeur pour la zone euro consiste à « réinventer » un modèle 
d’intégration financière nouveau et robuste. Nous avons besoin d’importants flux privés de 
capitaux transfrontières car nous ne souhaitons pas que l’Eurosystème joue durablement un rôle 
d’intermédiation entre les emprunteurs et les prêteurs de différents pays. Le développement 
d’un processus de titrisation sûr doit constituer une priorité, en dépit d’importantes difficultés 
techniques.  
 
II/ - L’Europe est-elle face à la perspective d’une décennie perdue ? 
 
Les interrogations que suscite la croissance à long terme ne se limitent pas à l’Europe. Elles reflètent 
une préoccupation d’ordre plus général, celle de la possibilité d’une  stagnation prolongée (ou 
""séculaire "") des économies avancées. Larry a lancé ce débat essentiel. J’ignore s’il avait 
spécifiquement le cas de l’Europe en tête, mais cette question nous concerne, bien évidemment, de très 
près.  
 
3 
 
La stagnation prolongée des économies développées pourrait résulter d'une situation dans laquelle (ce 
que nous appelons) le taux d'intérêt ""naturel"" devient négatif. Ceci peut théoriquement se produire pour 
deux raisons :  
<U+F0A7> À court terme, à la suite d'un choc négatif de demande résultant, notamment, de la contraction 
du crédit et des bilans bancaires. Je viens  d'indiquer comment nous comptons y faire face en 
Europe.  
<U+F0A7> À plus long terme, une conjonction de facteurs peut provoquer à la fois une hausse de l'épargne 
et une baisse de l'investissement. En particulier, les économies avancées sont affectées d'une 
part par le vieillissement de la population  et, d'autre part, le ralentissement du progrès 
technique et de l’innovation, qui font baisser le rendement anticipé du capital.  
 
La vraie réponse au risque de stagnation prolongée consiste donc à améliorer le rendement du capital, 
et ramener ainsi le taux d’intérêt naturel à un niveau positif. Là encore, il ne s’agit pas uniquement d’un 
problème européen. Mais cela suppose des réformes structurelles, qui stimulent l'investissement.  
 
Ces réformes sont difficiles à mener. Nombre d'entre elles, toutefois sont lancées et actuellement mises 
en œuvre. L’Italie supprime ses provinces ; cette mesure sera source d’économies et permettra un 
allègement de la fiscalité et une libéralisation du marché du travail. La France a engagé le même type 
de réformes, avec un allégement des cotisations sociales pour les entreprises et une amélioration de la 
flexibilité du marché du travail.  
 
III/ - Les défis et les réponses à court terme de la politique économique  
 
Depuis plusieurs mois l'inflation est très faible dans la zone euro et continue à baisser. Les anticipations  
d'inflation à court et moyen terme s'ajustent également vers le bas.  C'est, aujourd'hui, notre principal 
défi. Une inflation trop faible freine l’ajustement des prix relatifs; elle constitue un obstacle à la 
réduction des écarts de compétitivité au sein de la zone euro; elle accroît, enfin, le risque d’une 
véritable déflation, si un choc négatif devait se produire à l’avenir.  
 
On observe également que, dans la zone euro, la croissance et l’inflation évoluent dans des directions 
opposées. Tandis que la croissance s’accélère, l’inflation continue à baisser. Cette « déconnexion » est 
surprenante. Elle incite à considérer la situation dans une perspective plus large. Les économies de la 
zone euro ont attiré d’importantes entrées de capitaux ces derniers mois, avec deux effets opposés sur 
les conditions financières : d'une part, un assouplissement par la réduction des taux d’intérêt à long 
terme; et, d'autre part, un durcissement lié à l'appréciation du taux de change de l’euro.  
 
Il n'est pas certain que l’effet global soit positif. Si l'on considère les taux d'intérêt nominaux, les 
conditions financières sont plus accommodantes dans la zone euro qu’aux États-Unis. Si l'on prend les 
taux réels, le constat s'inverse et la désinflation peut accentuer ces divergences. Il y a donc un risque 
que se développe une spirale négative, dans laquelle la baisse de l'inflation, la hausse des taux réels, les 
entrées de capitaux et l'appréciation du taux de change s’alimentent mutuellement, conduisant 
l’économie vers un équilibre non souhaitable.  
 
4 
 
La situation nécessitait une réponse de politique monétaire appropriée et, comme vous le savez, le 
Conseil des gouverneurs a adopté jeudi dernier un ensemble de quatre mesures fortes :  
 
Premièrement, le taux d’intérêt des opérations principales de refinancement et le taux de la facilité de 
dépôt ont tous deux été abaissés, le taux de la facilité de dépôt devenant négatif pour la première fois. 
Cela devrait encourager les intermédiaires financiers à utiliser activement leurs liquidités sur les 
marchés du crédit et des actifs.  
 
Ces liquidités devraient être significativement renforcées car : 
 
Deuxièmement, le dispositif d’apport de liquidité en quantité illimitée et à taux fixe a été prolongé 
jusqu’à fin 2016. 
 
Troisièmement, l’Eurosystème effectuera des nouvelles opérations de refinancement ciblées et à plus 
long terme (TLTRO). Cette liquidité exceptionnelle sera fournie à long terme (jusqu’à quatre ans) et à 
un taux fixe, indiquant clairement que l’orientation accommodante de la politique monétaire devrait 
persister sur une très longue période. 
 
Enfin, l’Eurosystème se prépare activement à effectuer des achats de titres adossés à des actifs (ABS) 
qui contribueront à améliorer la transmission de notre politique monétaire accommodante et 
permettront d’assouplir les conditions de financement des entreprises, notamment les PME.

CONFÉRENCE « LA CYBERSÉCURITÉ DANS LE SECTEUR FINANCIER » 
17 juin 2014 
 
Discours d’ouverture
1
 de Robert Ophèle, Sous-gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Mesdames et messieurs, je suis très heureux d’inaugurer cette conférence traitant de la cybersécurité 
dans le secteur financier.  Ce sujet pourrait être jugé de prime abord comme très technique, et de 
nature à n’être abordé que dans le cadre restreint d’une réunion d’experts. Ce serait une erreur et il 
importe au contraire que les autorités publiques, y compris les banques centrales, prêtent une attention 
suffisante à la cybersécurité, compte tenu de ses implications à l’échelle du système, notamment pour 
le fonctionnement du système financier. 
Au cours des dix dernières années, le secteur financier a changé profondément avec l’apparition 
d’internet et l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information. Le marché s’est montré capable 
d’innover et d’améliorer la qualité, les performances et l’efficience de services, tels que la banque en 
ligne, les paiements par téléphone mobile et les plates-formes de règlement-livraison. Les autorités 
publiques ont en effet encouragé la dématérialisation dans le secteur financier afin de favoriser la 
croissance économique ainsi que pour réduire les risques opérationnels inhérents aux procédures 
antérieurement non automatisées. Par exemple, le nouveau règlement européen relatif aux dépositaires 
centraux de titres nécessite de recourir à des titres dématérialisés et encourage le traitement 
automatique de bout en bout dans les systèmes de règlement-livraison de titres. 
En ce sens, les évolutions technologiques ont permis de faire face à certains risques opérationnels 
inhérents aux activités financières, notamment de réduire les erreurs d’exécution dans les procédures 
(qui représentent une source importante de pertes liées aux risques opérationnels). De ce point de vue, 
la cyberactivité est une source de croissance économique et de progrès, essentielle pour le secteur 
financier. 
Toutefois, bien que le développement d’internet et la croissance des transactions électroniques aient 
permis de mieux contrôler les risques opérationnels grâce à la réduction des facteurs d’erreurs 
humaines ou opérationnelles, il a également fait émerger de nouveaux risques. La rapide expansion

Page 2 sur 5 
des réseaux et des technologies, l’ouverture des systèmes d’information aux échanges externes, le 
nombre croissant de transactions électroniques ont provoqué l’émergence d’une nouvelle forme de 
criminalité, la « cybercriminalité ». 
Le secteur financier est effectivement une cible attrayante pour les cybercriminels : une étude 
américaine
2
 menée par Symantec montre que le secteur de la finance et de l’assurance est l’un des 
principaux secteurs visés par les cyberattaques, juste après l’Administration publique. Cela n’a bien 
entendu pas échappé aux autorités de surveillance, qui ont déjà pris un certain nombre de mesures 
pour aider le secteur à résoudre ce problème, mais qui rencontrent certaines difficultés à y faire face. 
I. De fait, les orientations émanant des autorités de surveillance, comme celles relatives au risque 
opérationnel publiées par le Comité de Bâle en 2011
3
, soulignent que la prévention et la bonne gestion 
de ce risque relèvent de la stabilité financière, dans la mesure où les défaillances opérationnelles 
peuvent être source de risque systémique. 
Le risque systémique découle en premier lieu du développement spectaculaire des interdépendances 
entre intermédiaires financiers lié à l’automatisation accrue des activités financières, notamment les 
activités de compensation et de paiement, qui sont un des principaux vecteurs d’interconnexion. 
Ce risque résulte également de la possible perte de confiance du grand public dans les paiements 
électroniques pouvant être causée par un défaut de protection de l’intégrité et de la fiabilité des 
données traitées par ces systèmes.  
Cela étant, les réponses aux cybermenaces peuvent entrer en conflit avec d’autres priorités établies, 
tout particulièrement en ce qui concerne les infrastructures de marchés financiers. Par exemple, le 
principe 17 du CSPR–OICV relatif au risque opérationnel définit clairement les exigences de 
continuité d’exploitation pour les infrastructures de marchés financiers. Les plans de continuité 
opérationnelle doivent avoir pour objectif la reprise rapide des opérations, un redémarrage de l’activité 
dans les deux heures suivant l’interruption, et la garantie d’un règlement avant la fin de la journée dans 
les conditions extrêmes. Toutefois, le respect de cette exigence soulève des difficultés particulières en 
cas de cyberattaque ou d’altération des données, la priorité absolue n’étant alors pas de reprendre 
rapidement les opérations, mais d’abord de restaurer la qualité et l’intégrité des données pour éviter 
tout risque de contagion. 
Cela vaut également pour l’autorisation qui pourrait être accordée à des tiers d’accéder à un compte de 
paiement en ligne afin d’apporter une assistance à l’initiation des paiements. Un accès de cette nature

favoriserait la concurrence et l’innovation dans le secteur des paiements, mais multiplierait de toute 
évidence les risques de cyberattaques. 
En outre, il est nécessaire de trouver le juste équilibre entre la nécessité de prévenir et de gérer 
correctement les cybermenaces et l’impératif, pour les acteurs acteurs financiers, de mettre en œuvre 
des solutions économiquement viables. Par exemple, la mise en place d’un double système 
informatique de secours pourrait constituer une réponse efficace à certaines cyberattaques, mais elle a 
un coût. 
Enfin, la cybersécurité est aussi un problème mondial : pour apporter une réponse plus efficace, il est 
nécessaire d’instaurer une coopération à l’échelle internationale et dans les différents secteurs, bien au-
delà du secteur financier. Dans cette perspective, il convient de saluer les initiatives du Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) aux États–Unis visant à améliorer la coopération entre les 
secteurs, en particulier ceux qui dépendent du secteur financier, comme les secteurs des services 
collectifs ou des télécommunications, ou la création de l’Agence européenne chargée de la sécurité des 
réseaux et de l’information. 
 
II. Dans ce contexte, comprendre les menaces, organiser la protection et la prévention ainsi que 
la coordination des actions privées et publiques sont des conditions préalables à une lutte 
efficace contre la cybercriminalité. L’objectif de la session d’aujourd’hui est de réfléchir 
collectivement sur ce thème et de mettre en commun nos expériences. 
La première étape importante est de comprendre pourquoi le secteur financier est une cible de 
prédilection des attaques  des pirates informatiques. C’est l’un des objectifs assignés au premier 
groupe d’intervenants de haut niveau. Ils vont tenter de répondre à des questions comme  : quels sont 
les facteurs qui font du secteur financier une cible privilégiée pour la cybercriminalité ? Comment 
détecter et quantifier les cyberattaques ? Quels sont les incidences de la cybercriminalité sur la 
stabilité financière ? 
Un sujet doit retenir particulièrement notre attention: les monnaies virtuelles. Les récentes opérations 
de lutte contre la délinquance financière ont montré que les nouveaux modes de paiements faisant 
appel à internet, et reliant la sphère virtuelle à la sphère réelle, représentent pour les cybercriminels un 
moyen privilégié pour blanchir de l’argent. Ainsi, les monnaies virtuelles ont récemment attiré 
l’attention des autorités et, en particulier, celle des banques centrales. Conçues comme des alternatives 
 
Page 4 sur 5 
aux monnaies officielles mais sans garantie de remboursement, elles ne peuvent pas être répertoriées 
comme des monnaies parce qu’elles n’ont pas cours légal et n’empiètent donc pas sur le monopole 
d’émission de la monnaie par la banque centrale. Toutefois, même si elles ne constituent pas pour 
l’instant une menace importante pour la stabilité financière, elles soulèvent de graves problèmes en 
termes de blanchiment d’argent et peuvent être perçues comme des véhicules destinés à des 
investissements spéculatifs. Par conséquent, la réglementation des monnaies virtuelles représente un 
défi pour les autorités. Les questions abordées par les intervenants qui traiteront de ce sujet pourraient 
être, par exemple : Devons-nous interdire l’utilisation des monnaies virtuelles pour nous protéger de la 
cybercriminalité et du développement du blanchiment d’argent et du terrorisme ? Ou vaut-il mieux 
définir la problématique juridique, réglementaire et éthique que soulèvent les monnaies virtuelles ? 
Ces interventions seront suivies d’une table ronde consacrée aux solutions envisagées par le secteur 
financier pour contrecarrer les nouvelles stratégies des cybercriminels. Dans quelle mesure les 
orientations et les principes en vigueur permettent-ils de gérer la menace que représente la 
cybercriminalité ? Peut-on réellement décourager la cybercriminalité ou tout au moins s’en défendre ? 
Les institutions financières ont-elles pris des mesures structurelles et technologiques efficaces pour 
améliorer leur cyberdéfense ? L’assurance contre la cybercriminalité fonctionne-t-elle et comment le 
risque est-il valorisé ?  De quel type de communication destinée au public avons-nous besoin pour 
lutter contre ces nouvelles menaces ? Nos débats devraient aborder ces questions fondamentales. 
En outre, les autorités de surveillance et de contrôle doivent s’assurer qu’au niveau individuel, la 
gestion du risque est efficace. Un cadre normatif a été mis en place par les institutions européennes 
pour lutter contre la cybercriminalité et garantir la robustesse des marchés financiers (notamment 
grâce à l’adoption par le Parlement européen de la directive concernant la sécurité des réseaux et de 
l’information) ; un comité de la BRI, le CSPR, est en cours de réflexion sur la cybersécurité des 
infrastructures de marché. Dans un échange de vues, deux éminents intervenants nous indiqueront s’ils 
estiment que le cadre réglementaire existant offre une garantie suffisante contre la cybercriminalité. 
Enfin, en tant que banque centrale, il est de la plus haute importance de s’assurer que le marché peut 
résister à des cybermenaces. La dernière table ronde s’attachera à déterminer dans quelle mesure la 
 
Page 5 sur 5 
résistance des places financières doit évoluer sous l’influence des menaces que représente la 
cybercriminalité : l’accroissement des interdépendances transfrontières entre les places financières 
(utilisation d’infrastructures de marché communes, existence d’acteurs financiers de dimension 
internationale et de fournisseurs transnationaux) nécessite-t-il une approche internationale ? Faut-il 
réfléchir également à une approche multi-sectorielle, la dépendance vis-à-vis de fournisseurs d’accès 
communs (comme les opérateurs de télécommunication) créant une importante communauté d’intérêt 
autour de l’enjeu de la cybersécurité ? Ces réflexions devraient, je l’espère, renvoyer aux priorités 
définies par la Banque de France, qui consistent à promouvoir une approche coopérative et 
coordonnée pour assurer la robustesse de la place financière de Paris et à vérifier, grâce à des tests de 
résistance collectifs, que les différents plans de continuité offrent une cohérence d’ensemble et sont 
bien adaptés à des menaces en constante évolution. 
Enfin, pour conclure, et je m’arrêterai là, j’aimerais attirer votre attention sur deux points : 
Premièrement, la Banque de France considère véritablement comme une priorité le fait que les actions 
soient coordonnées au plan international, compte tenu de l’accroissement des interdépendances 
mondiales.  
Deuxièmement, les solutions devraient émaner du secteur financier et la régulation ne devrait être 
utilisée qu’en cas de défaillance du marché. Les meilleures pratiques en vue d’améliorer la 
cybersécurité doivent être identifiées et adoptées par les différents acteurs. Les banques centrales 
pourraient avoir un rôle à jouer dans ce processus ; à titre d’exemple, la Banque de France a 
recommandé pendant de nombreuses années la mise en œuvre d’une authentification rigoureuse pour 
protéger les paiements en ligne. De nombreuses attaques peuvent ainsi être efficacement déjouées. 
 
Je vous remercie de votre attention et je vous souhaite des discussions fructueuses et animées sur 
l’ensemble de ces aspects, dans l’espoir que cette conférence vous donnera une vision exhaustive des 
enjeux de la cybersécurité et des réactions possibles aux cybermenaces. Je cède maintenant la parole à 
M. Steve Purser.

Assemblée Générale de l’ASF  
Mardi 24 juin 2014 
 
Discours de Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
C’est toujours avec grand plaisir que j’interviens lors de l’assemblée générale de l’Association 
française des sociétés financières. 
C’est l’occasion pour moi de vous présenter les actions et positions de la Banque de France et de 
l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, dans un environnement réglementaire qui a connu 
des évolutions majeures en 2013 au niveau européen, dans le cadre de la réforme CRD IV. 
Les travaux de transposition de CRD IV ont  fortement mobilisé les autorités de tutelle ainsi que la 
profession bancaire, au second semestre de 2013,  notamment avec l’introduction dans le droit français 
d’un nouveau statut d’établissement : celui de société de financement. Ces travaux se sont poursuivis en 
2014 avec  l’adoption en février dernier de l’ordonnance de transposition et la publication à venir des 
décrets d’application.    
Je souhaite à cet égard remercier les professionnels du secteur et notamment l’ASF et ses adhérents, 
qui ont participé très activement aux réunions de consultation sur les projets de textes, dans un 
contexte économique par ailleurs difficile pour beaucoup d’établissements spécialisés, comme le 
président Dumont l’a d’ailleurs souligné dans son introduction.  
Mon intervention portera d’abord sur (I) la réforme des statuts, en particulier le statut de société de 
financement, sous lequel une part significative d’entre vous exerce dorénavant ses activités. Je 
reviendrai ensuite (II) sur des points réglementaires, qui viennent d’être introduits ou sont en voie de 
l’être, et qui constituent un enjeu important pour les membres de l’ASF.  
1) La réforme des statuts 
Vous le savez, les sociétés financières ont la possibilité, depuis le 1
er
 janvier 2014, date d’entrée en 
vigueur de l’ordonnance du 27 juin 2013, d’exercer leurs activités sous le statut d’établissement de 
crédit, au sens des nouveaux textes européens, ou sous le statut national de société de financement. 
- Le statut d’établissement de crédit spécialisé a été automatiquement conféré aux sociétés 
financières. Il permet de recevoir des fonds remboursables du public, ainsi que d’effectuer les 
autres opérations de banque, dans les limites de l’agrément reçu. Ces établissements sont 
évidemment soumis à l’ensemble des dispositions de CRR-CRD IV et ils disposent de tous les 
droits attachés au statut d’établissement de crédit, notamment le passeport européen.  
- Le statut, purement national, de société de financement permet quant à lui d’effectuer des 
opérations de crédit dans les conditions définies par l’agrément, ainsi que de proposer les 
services connexes non réglementés, sans pouvoir recevoir de fonds remboursables du public. 
   
2 
 
Le régime prudentiel des sociétés de financement a été élaboré en s’alignant autant que possible sur 
celui des établissements de crédit. L’arrêté du 23 décembre 2013, qui définit les règles prudentielles 
applicables aux sociétés de financement, renvoie d’ailleurs dans une large mesure au règlement CRR.  
Un large alignement du régime prudentiel des sociétés de financement sur celui des établissements de 
crédit était en particulier indispensable pour que ces sociétés puissent être traitées comme des 
contreparties bancaires par les établissements de crédit. Les risques portant sur les sociétés de 
financement seront ainsi traités de la même manière que ceux portant sur des établissements de crédit, 
pour l’application de la réglementation prudentielle. 
Je tiens néanmoins à souligner que, par-delà cet alignement, la prise en compte  des spécificités des 
sociétés de financement a conduit à adapter leur régime prudentiel, notamment en matière de liquidité 
et de reconnaissance des fonds propres. À cet égard, concernant vos préoccupations relatives à la prise 
en compte des intérêts minoritaires des entités régulées qui ne sont pas des établissements de crédit, 
les dispositions du CRR devront être précisées par des interprétations des instances européennes 
compétentes (Commission européenne et ABE) pour permettre une application homogène de ces 
textes par les superviseurs nationaux et donc une égalité s’agissant de la concurrence. 
 
Je relève que beaucoup d’établissements ont d’ores et déjà opté pour ce nouveau statut. Sur 215 
sociétés financières à la fin de l’année 2013, l’ACPR a reçu 102 demandes d’option pour le statut de 
société de financement. Ces demandes proviennent d’établissements aux profils diversifiés, 
représentant toutes les activités des sociétés financières : affacturage, crédits spécialisés, crédit-bail, 
caution, ce qui montre l’adéquation de ce statut vis-à-vis des différents métiers des adhérents de 
l’ASF.  
Plus de la moitié des demandes a déjà reçu une suite favorable. Je tiens à souligner ici la qualité des 
échanges conduits avec les professionnels, qui a contribué au bon déroulement de la procédure 
d’option pour le nouveau statut. Deux problématiques délicates ont émergé au cours des derniers mois, 
sur lesquelles je souhaite revenir : l’accès au refinancement de l’Eurosystème et l’accès aux systèmes 
de paiement. 
Comme vous le savez, la notion d’établissement de crédit est un élément  structurant du dispositif de 
politique monétaire de l’Eurosystème. Elle définit les conditions d’éligibilité des contreparties de 
politique monétaire et entre en ligne de compte dans la politique de collatéral. D’une part, sont 
éligibles aux opérations de politique monétaire les entités assujetties aux réserves obligatoires, celles-
ci étant par définition des établissements de crédit. D’autre part, les seuls crédits qui sont mobilisables 
comme collatéral de politique monétaire sont les crédits octroyés par un établissement de crédit. Ces 
règles répondent à des considérations fondamentales. La principale étant que, dans une économie de la 
zone euro  dominée par le crédit bancaire, les établissements de crédit sont le vecteur naturel de la 
transmission des impulsions de politique monétaire.  
 
Les sociétés financières qui perdent leur statut d’Établissement de Crédit en devenant société de 
financement ne peuvent donc plus être contreparties de politique monétaire.  
 
Par ailleurs, en vertu du cadre juridique européen, l’accès aux systèmes de paiement et de règlement 
est limité aux établissements de crédit et entreprises d’investissement. Les sociétés de financement qui 
ne disposent pas d’un agrément pour offrir des services d’investissement ne peuvent donc plus 
participer à ces systèmes.  
C’est pourquoi la Banque de France a sensibilisé les sociétés de financement aux conséquences du 
nouveau statut en matière d’accès aux systèmes de paiement et les a accompagnées dans la recherche 
d’une solution. En particulier, les échanges entre la Banque de France, l’ACPR et votre association ont 
permis de préciser la façon dont les sociétés de financement pouvaient continuer à bénéficier des 
systèmes de paiement et de règlement, en devenant clientes d’un participant. 
 
La seconde conséquence induite par le nouveau statut de société de financement concerne la 
mobilisation des actifs comme collatéral de politique monétaire. Je comprends que ce point fasse 
l’objet d’une certaine préoccupation de la part des professionnels. Sur ce sujet, les implications du 
   
3 
 
choix du statut de société de financement, sur lesquelles nous avons attiré très tôt l’attention des 
sociétés financières, sont de deux ordres.  
 
Première implication : les sociétés de financement n’étant plus contreparties de politique monétaire, 
elles ne peuvent plus obtenir de crédit de la part de l’Eurosystème et leurs actifs ne sont donc plus 
mobilisables directement auprès de l’Eurosystème. Pour autant, les actifs détenus par les sociétés de 
financement restent éligibles, dès lors qu’ils respectent les critères de l’Eurosystème. En clair, le 
changement de statut de l’établissement n’a pas de conséquence sur l’éligibilité intrinsèque du 
collatéral.  
 
Le choix de devenir société de financement a néanmoins une seconde conséquence sur la mobilisation 
indirecte des créances privées. En effet, l’Eurosystème n’accepte comme collatéral que les créances 
privées représentant une dette vis-à-vis d’un établissement de crédit. Pour pouvoir être effectivement  
mobilisées, ces créances doivent donc être apportées par une contrepartie de politique monétaire à 
laquelle elles ont été cédées en pleine propriété. Cette condition de cession en pleine propriété écarte 
la souplesse qu’offre le recours au mécanisme de cession à titre de garantie prévu par l’article L.211-
38 du Code monétaire et financier.  
 
Je souligne que ces conditions de mobilisation résultent de règles que l’Eurosystème applique de façon 
uniforme dans l’ensemble de la zone euro, afin d’assurer l’égalité de traitement de l’ensemble des 
contreparties.  
Mes équipes restent bien entendu à la disposition des établissements qui souhaiteraient nous rencontrer 
sur l’un ou l’autre de ces sujets.  
Je souhaiterais maintenant profiter de l’invitation qui m’a été faite de m’exprimer devant vous pour 
tenter d’éclairer certains aspects de la mise en œuvre du paquet CRD4/CRR vis-à-vis desquels vous 
avez manifesté de légitimes préoccupations. 
2) Les points réglementaires 
Je voudrais à cet égard aborder les questions relatives à la gouvernance et au contrôle interne, ainsi 
que la liquidité. 
L’ordonnance du 20 février 2014 a transposé en droit français plusieurs dispositions importantes de la  
CRD IV, qui concernent non seulement les établissements de crédit mais aussi les sociétés de 
financement.  
Ces textes comportent un volet « gouvernance » qui introduit de nouvelles règles relatives aux 
dirigeants, à l’organisation des établissements et à leur contrôle interne, aux rémunérations ainsi 
qu’aux comités spécialisés.   
Je  soulignerai ici l’enjeu de la mise en œuvre de ces nouvelles dispositions, qui visent à garantir que 
les établissements disposent d’une structure organisationnelle claire, avec un partage de 
responsabilités bien défini, transparent et cohérent, des mécanismes adéquats de contrôle interne et de 
rémunération, qui permettent une gestion saine et prudente des risques.  
La directive souligne l’importance de l’équilibre des pouvoirs en matière de gouvernance. Celui-ci 
repose notamment sur la séparation des fonctions exécutives et de surveillance. La directive CRD4 a 
ainsi consacré ce principe de séparation des fonctions, en prévoyant que la présidence du conseil 
d’administration, organe chargé de surveiller l’action de la direction générale, ne puisse être exercée 
par le directeur général.  
L’importance donnée par CRD4 aux questions de gouvernance a également conduit la directive à 
confier aux autorités de contrôle la mission de vérifier que les membres du conseil d’administration et 
de la direction générale disposent bien de l’expérience, de la compétence et de l’honorabilité requises 
pour l’exercice de leurs fonctions. L’ACPR a désormais le pouvoir de s’opposer à la désignation ou au 
maintien en fonction d’un membre du conseil d’administration ou de la direction générale, s’il ne 
respectait pas ou plus les exigences requises.  Cela montre à quel point les personnes chargées de la 
   
4 
 
surveillance sont considérées comme  jouant un rôle essentiel  pour l’équilibre de la gouvernance, qui 
intéresse directement le superviseur.  
Par ailleurs, la directive conduit à ce que la direction d’un établissement soit une activité exercée à 
temps plein, ou au moins à titre principal. Elle limite ainsi strictement les cumuls de fonctions. Les 
règles sont précises : pas plus d’un mandat exécutif et de deux mandats non exécutifs pour une même 
personne ; pas plus de quatre mandats de membre du conseil d’administration, du conseil de 
surveillance ou de tout autre organe exerçant des fonctions équivalentes.  
Ce renforcement des règles de gouvernance a suscité parmi vous des interrogations quant à la mise en 
œuvre du principe de proportionnalité pour l’application des règles précitées. Je voudrais préciser ce 
point. 
Ainsi, la loi ouvre la possibilité pour l’ACPR d’autoriser un cumul des fonctions de président du 
conseil d’administration et de directeur général au vu des justifications produites par l’établissement 
de crédit ou la société de financement. Les principes régissant une telle dérogation ont été précisés 
dans la position 2014-P-02 de l’ACPR, avec des critères de taille, de nature et de complexité des 
activités exercées. 
Les règles de cumul des mandats ne s’appliquent en outre qu’aux établissements revêtant une 
importance significative en raison de leur taille, de leur organisation interne ainsi que de la nature, de 
l’échelle et de la complexité de leurs activités. La concertation menée actuellement par les autorités 
vise à définir des seuils de significativité tenant compte de la structure propre au secteur bancaire 
français, sans remettre en cause les objectifs finaux de la directive. Elle aboutira prochainement à la 
publication d’un décret, qui permettra à chaque société d’évaluer clairement l’impact des nouvelles 
règles sur les mandats de ses dirigeants. 
Pour l’application des nouvelles règles de gouvernance, les établissements pourront s’appuyer sur la 
façon dont ils avaient décliné le principe de proportionnalité en application des dispositions du 
règlement 97-02, qui est maintenant inscrit au niveau législatif. 
Pour conclure sur les aspects règlementaires, je souhaiterais rappeler le calendrier des textes relatifs à 
la liquidité.  
- Le texte définitif définissant le ratio LCR au niveau bâlois a été publié en janvier 2014. Les 
discussions sont en cours au niveau européen sur le contenu de l’acte délégué de la 
Commission européenne qui devrait être adopté d’ici à la fin du mois de juin 2014 et qui 
définira les exigences définitives du LCR.  
- Le ratio NFSR est en cours de discussion au niveau bâlois et devrait être publié dans sa 
version définitive en janvier 2015, pour une mise en œuvre en janvier 2018. Après une 
première publication du standard en décembre 2010, une version révisée en a été publiée en 
janvier 2014 ; elle a été soumise à une consultation publique qui s’est achevée en avril.  
Les règles qui s’appliqueront aux banques françaises seront définies au niveau européen. Nous ne 
pouvons donc nous engager sur l’aboutissement des demandes émises afin d’adapter ces règles en 
fonction de la nature des établissements. Je suis pour ma part favorable aux dispositions favorisant un 
financement efficace de l’économie, en particulier s’agissant des besoins des PME. Néanmoins, ces 
dispositions ne doivent pas être contraires à l’objectif prudentiel par ailleurs poursuivi, qui doit 
permettre de veiller à ce que les organismes prêteurs aient une gestion saine de leur risque de liquidité, 
et qu’ils soient notamment en mesure de continuer à prêter lorsque les conditions de refinancement se 
tendent. 
Un dernier mot sur le surendettement, sujet de préoccupation pour la Banque de France comme pour 
vous.  
   
5 
 
Je partage votre sentiment que les gouvernements, et le parlement, ont eu tendance à modifier les 
règles trop souvent, parfois sans que la réforme précédente ait porté tous ses effets, et rendant ainsi 
l’adaptation des procédures difficile. J’appelle donc de mes vœux une période de stabilité législative. 
En ce qui concerne les fichiers, le fichier positif a disparu du paysage depuis la décision du Conseil 
constitutionnel. Nous-mêmes avions toujours émis les plus grands doutes sur la faisabilité d’un fichier 
qui soit à la fois acceptable vis-à-vis des grands principes du droit, et opérable. Même pour la version 
soumise au Conseil constitutionnel, c’était loin d’être évident. 
Je me réjouis des travaux que vous avez lancés. Enrichir les fichiers existants me paraît la seule option 
possible, et il importe en effet de montrer à l’extérieur que nous pouvons tirer le meilleur de nos 
fichiers traditionnels, et que c’est la seule voie d’avenir. Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Paris Europlace Forum financier international  
Paris, le 8 juillet 2014 
Discours de Christian Noyer – Gouverneur de la Banque de France 
 
 
Mesdames et messieurs, cher Arnaud, 
 
Je suis heureux de pouvoir prononcer ce discours aujourd'hui dans le cadre de notre Forum financier international Paris 
Europlace, avant le début des tables rondes. La période actuelle est délicate pour les responsables de la politique 
économique, les banquiers centraux et les professionnels de la finance et de la banque en Europe. 
 
J'aborderai trois questions : La crise de l’euro est-elle terminée ? L’Europe est-elle confrontée à la perspective d’une 
décennie perdue ? Quels défis à court terme devons-nous relever aujourd’hui ? Et je conclurai par quelques remarques 
concernant les évolutions récentes de notre stratégie de communication. 
 
I/ La crise de l’euro est-elle terminée ? 
 
Il y a moins de deux ans, la question, pour la zone euro, était celle de son existence-même. Les euro-pessimistes doutaient 
de sa capacité à survivre. Ce n’est plus le cas. Les analystes s'interrogent peut-être sur la capacité de l'Europe à retrouver 
le chemin de la croissance. Cependant, les défis auxquels nous sommes confrontés aujourd’hui sont différents. Ils sont de 
nature macroéconomique et non d’ordre existentiel ou systémique. 
 
Les conditions financières se normalisent, grâce, principalement, aux mesures prises par l’Eurosystème. Les écarts de taux 
d'intérêt des pays périphériques se sont considérablement réduits. Les finances publiques seront bientôt raisonnablement 
équilibrées et l’incidence négative du resserrement budgétaire cessera de peser sur l’économie. Les bilans des ménages et 
des entreprises sont solides. Les prévisions récentes tablent sur une croissance supérieure à 2 % en Allemagne, positive en 
Italie et les perspectives se sont sensiblement améliorées pour la France. En avril, la croissance de l’activité dans la zone 
euro a atteint son plus haut niveau depuis trois ans. 
Mais la crise a laissé des séquelles importantes : 
 
<U+F0A7> Les marchés monétaires et financiers demeurent beaucoup trop fragmentés. La transmission de la politique 
monétaire est sérieusement altérée et les conditions du crédit demeurent très différentes selon les pays ou les 
secteurs. 
<U+F0A7> Le processus de désendettement du secteur bancaire reste un obstacle à la reprise et à la croissance. Le crédit 
bancaire demeure atone dans l’ensemble de la zone euro et le financement des PME est une préoccupation 
majeure, en particulier dans les pays en difficulté, où le pourcentage d’emprunteurs viables subissant des 
contraintes de financement est estimé à 25 % contre 1 % dans les pays « du cœur » de la zone.  
 
Nous avons pleinement conscience du fait que l'assainissement des bilans bancaires est une condition préalable à la reprise 
du crédit et à l'efficacité de la politique monétaire. Nous nous sommes donc attaqués à ce problème de front. 
 
 2 
1. Nous bâtissons un système d’intermédiation financière plus sûr et plus robuste. La création d’une union bancaire a 
constitué une étape décisive. Comme vous le savez, elle permettra de rompre le lien entre risque bancaire et risque 
souverain et garantira une supervision financière harmonisée et rigoureuse. Il ne faut pas sous-estimer 
l’importance d’une telle réalisation. Le principe en a été adopté il y a moins de deux ans. Le mécanisme de 
surveillance unique est désormais en place et fonctionne. Jamais, dans l’histoire européenne contemporaine, 
autant de progrès n’avaient été réalisés en aussi peu de temps. 
 
2. Nous avons lancé un examen complet et approfondi de la qualité des actifs bancaires, suivi de tests de résistance 
des banques qui devraient être achevés d’ici la fin de cette année. Pour la première fois, ces exercices seront 
réalisés selon une méthodologie harmonisée, sous l’égide du MSU, dans des conditions de totale transparence des 
résultats. Leur achèvement marquera un tournant à partir duquel il ne subsistera plus de doute quant à la 
soutenabilité de nos banques et le crédit devrait reprendre à un rythme normal. 
 
3. À plus long terme, un défi majeur pour la zone euro consiste à « réinventer » un nouveau modèle robuste 
d’intégration financière. Nous avons besoin de solides flux privés de capitaux transfrontaliers car nous ne 
souhaitons pas que l’Eurosystème joue durablement un rôle d’intermédiation entre les emprunteurs et les prêteurs 
de différents pays. Le développement d’un processus de titrisation sûr doit constituer une priorité, en dépit 
d'importantes difficultés techniques.  
 
II/ L’Europe est-elle face à la perspective d’une décennie perdue ? 
 
Les interrogations que suscite la croissance à long terme ne se limitent pas à l’Europe. Ce que nous entendons au sujet de 
notre continent reflète une préoccupation d’ordre plus général, celle de la possibilité d’une « stagnation séculaire » des 
économies avancées.  
 
La stagnation séculaire part de l’hypothèse que le taux d’intérêt naturel devient négatif et ce, pour deux raisons :  
 
<U+F0A7> À court terme, un choc négatif de demande pourrait se produire, conjugué à une hausse de l’épargne, résultant du 
processus de désendettement. Je viens juste d'indiquer que faire face à ce problème était pour nous actuellement 
une priorité. 
 
<U+F0A7> À plus long terme, le vieillissement de la population et le ralentissement de l’innovation sont susceptibles de 
pousser les taux d’épargne à la hausse et de faire baisser le rendement du capital. Par conséquent, la solution 
ultime face au risque de stagnation séculaire consiste à améliorer le rendement de l'investissement, ramenant ainsi 
le taux d’intérêt naturel en territoire positif. Là encore, il ne s’agit pas uniquement d’un problème européen. Mais 
nous éprouvons des difficultés à cet égard. Les réformes structurelles sont difficiles à mener.  
 
Un certain nombre d'entre elles, toutefois, sont actuellement mises en œuvre. La France, bien qu'à un rythme trop lent, 
réduit les cotisations sociales sur le travail et a quelque peu amélioré la flexibilité du marché du travail. 
 
Les efforts d'ajustement fournis par plusieurs pays, notamment dans le sud de l'Europe, commencent à porter leurs fruits. 
Les écarts de compétitivité entre les États membres du nord et ceux du sud ont été réduits, notamment grâce à des baisses 
des salaires réels dans des pays tels que l'Espagne ou le Portugal, qui exportent de plus en plus. Cette évolution ouvre la 
voie à une croissance saine dans les pays périphériques, qui enregistrent un excédent commercial de 2 % de leur PIB en 
moyenne et un déficit public modéré, ramené à 3 %. 
 
III/ - Les défis et les réponses à court terme des politiques publiques  
 
Le principal défi, bien entendu, concerne le faible niveau de l’inflation, toujours en recul, les anticipations d’inflation dans 
la zone euro s’inscrivant en baisse à court et à moyen termes. Cela empêche l’ajustement des prix relatifs, mécanisme 
important pour l’élimination des écarts de compétitivité, et accroît le risque d’une véritable déflation, si un choc négatif 
devait se produire à l’avenir.  
 
Curieusement, dans la zone euro, la croissance et l’inflation évoluent dans des directions opposées. Tandis que la 
croissance s’accélère, l’inflation continue de diminuer. Cette « déconnexion » de la courbe de Phillips est surprenante. 
 3 
Elle incite à considérer la situation dans une perspective plus large. Les économies de la zone euro ont attiré d’importantes 
entrées de capitaux ces derniers mois, avec deux effets opposés sur les conditions financières : d’une part, un 
assouplissement sous forme de réduction des taux d’intérêt à long terme. Et, d’autre part, une appréciation du taux de 
change de l’euro.  
Il n’est pas certain que l’effet global soit positif. Si les conditions nominales sont plus accommodantes dans la zone euro 
qu’aux États-Unis, les indicateurs réels font état d’une orientation plus restrictive. Il y a donc un risque de voir se 
développer une spirale négative, la faible inflation, la hausse des taux réels, les entrées de capitaux et l’appréciation du 
taux de change s’alimentant mutuellement. L’économie financière pourrait s’orienter vers un mauvais équilibre qui 
menacerait la reprise de l’économie réelle.  
 
Cette situation a nécessité une réponse appropriée de la part des autorités et, comme vous le savez, le Conseil des 
gouverneurs a approuvé, le mois dernier, un ensemble de quatre mesures décisives. 
 
Premièrement, le taux des opérations principales de refinancement et le taux de facilité de dépôt ont tous deux été 
abaissés, le taux de facilité de dépôt devenant même négatif pour la première fois. Deuxièmement, le dispositif ordinaire 
d’apport de liquidité en quantité illimitée a été prolongé jusqu’à la fin de l’année 2016. Troisièmement, l’Eurosystème 
conduira une nouvelle série d’opérations de refinancement à plus long terme ciblées. Cet apport exceptionnel de liquidité 
s’effectuera sur échéances longues (inférieures ou égales à quatre ans) et à taux fixe garanti, signe manifeste que 
l’orientation monétaire accommodante est appelée à persister sur une très longue période. Enfin, l’Eurosystème se prépare 
activement à acheter des titres adossés à des actifs qui favoriseront la transmission de l’orientation monétaire 
accommodante et amélioreront les conditions financières pour les emprunteurs non financiers du secteur privé, en 
particulier les PME. 
 
IV – Nouvelle stratégie de communication  
 
Comme vous le savez, deux décisions importantes ont été prises lors du dernier Conseil des gouverneurs : la fréquence 
des réunions de politique monétaire sera portée à six semaines et la BCE a l’intention de publier, à compter de 
janvier 2015, le compte rendu de ses débats de politique monétaire.  
Pourquoi ces décisions et pourquoi les prendre maintenant ? Nous partons du constat que la politique monétaire devient de 
plus en plus complexe. Cela vaut pour toutes les grandes banques centrales. La politique monétaire ne consiste plus 
uniquement à modifier les taux d’intérêt ; elle recouvre également de nombreuses autres mesures non conventionnelles. Il 
est donc plus difficile pour les marchés et pour les agents économiques de comprendre la logique économique qui sous-
tend cette panoplie complexe de décisions. Il demeure toutefois essentiel pour les banques centrales de pouvoir influer sur 
les anticipations. En effet, une forme de politique non conventionnelle, à savoir la forward guidance, repose entièrement 
sur le pilotage des anticipations relatives à la trajectoire future des taux d’intérêt. 
 
La mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire dans un contexte d’après crise est donc source de défis importants. On peut y 
répondre en mettant davantage l’accent sur le renforcement de la communication. 
 
Comme vous le savez, l’Eurosystème a toujours considéré la transparence comme une priorité. Nous avons été les 
premiers à organiser systématiquement des conférences de presse à l’issue de nos réunions de politique monétaire. Nous 
devons cependant aller plus loin et veiller à ce que les marchés comprennent bien le raisonnement qui sous-tend les 
décisions du Conseil des gouverneurs. À cette fin, nous devrions donner une idée des débats et des principaux arguments 
avancés. Dans notre jargon, l’objectif est de clarifier la « fonction de réaction » de la banque centrale et de permettre aux 
marchés financiers et au public de former des anticipations raisonnables au sujet de la politique future, ce qui nous donne 
la possibilité d’influer sur les taux d’intérêt à des horizons plus éloignés et de piloter les conditions économiques et 
financières au sens large. 
 
Il est trop tôt pour savoir exactement quelle forme revêtiront ces « comptes rendus ». Le Conseil des gouverneurs et le 
Directoire de la BCE vont tester différentes possibilités. De nombreux éléments doivent être pris en compte. Nous devons 
préserver la collégialité des délibérations du Conseil des gouverneurs, ainsi que la possibilité pour chacun de ses membres 
d’exprimer et d’échanger librement ses opinions, afin de se laisser influencer au fil des débats. Cela est primordial pour 
l’efficacité de notre prise de décision collégiale. Comme tout comité, le Conseil des gouverneurs bénéficie de la diversité 
des opinions et des points de vue exposés. Comme vous le savez tous, les membres participent et expriment leurs opinions 
à titre personnel ; ils doivent prendre en compte la situation de la zone euro dans son ensemble, et le Traité leur interdit de 
 4 
recevoir des instructions, quelles qu’elles soient, de la part de leur gouvernement. Nous devons prendre dûment en compte 
le dispositif institutionnel spécifique de la zone euro ainsi que les défis uniques qu’une union monétaire composée de 
plusieurs pays pose en matière de communication. 
Une fois prise la décision de publier des comptes rendus, il est naturel de modifier la fréquence des réunions de politique 
monétaire pour la porter à six semaines. Nous aurons ainsi le temps de produire les comptes rendus, sans pour autant créer 
de confusion au sujet de la prochaine réunion ou de toute autre mesure susceptible d’être prise.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Si de nombreuses incertitudes subsistent, les mesures prises au cours des deux derniers mois montrent néanmoins que 
l’Eurosystème est flexible, réactif et, comme nous l’avons dit à maintes reprises, prêt à prendre toute mesure qui s’impose 
si des risques à la baisse devaient encore se matérialiser.

International Association of Deposit Insurers 
INTERNATIONAL ERC CONFERENCE 
""Diversity and harmonisation of Deposit Insurance"" 
Paris 26 May 2016 
Closing speech by Robert Ophèle, Deputy Governor of Banque de France  
 
I wish to thank the IADI and the FGDR for inviting me to deliver this closing speech. Bruno 
Bezard opened the conference for the French Treasury, and a central banker will close it. 
This is a perfect arrangement.  
Deposit insurance or deposit guaranty is a fascinating tool. History and geography have 
demonstrated the variety of schemes and how they are a powerful force for the better, or 
perhaps for the worse. 
I can’t indeed refrain from quoting the American Bankers Association, in 1933, i.e. more than 
100 years after the introduction in the US of the first deposit insurance scheme, by the State 
of New York in 1829: “these historical experiences show that the guaranty plan is inherently 
fallacious and based on erroneous premises and assumptions. It has proved to be one of 
those plausible, but deceptive, human plans that in actual application only serve to render 
worse the very evils they seek to cure.” 
Today 113 Deposit Insurance Funds are in place, but I should stress that the jury is still out 
as to their effectiveness. Indeed, recent history shows how tricky deposit insurance can be. 
Just remember a few years ago, when schemes avoiding moral hazard by not providing a 
100 percent coverage of even the smallest deposits were favoured. Along this perfectly 
understandable line of reasoning, avoiding moral hazard, the UK Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme, in accordance with the European directive then in force, covered in 
full the first £2,000 deposit but only 90pc of the next £33,000. The Northern Rock crisis 
showed in a dramatic way that such a scheme was totally ineffective in preventing a bank 
run. 
Almost at the other end of the spectrum of possibilities, the Irish decision, in September 
2008, to increase its deposit insurance to an unlimited amount, triggered a transfer of 
savings from other countries, especially from the UK, and from branches of non-Irish banks 
operating in Ireland to Irish banks. It contributed to Ireland's financial debacle and illustrated 
the need for an international cooperative stance with regard to deposit insurance. 
2 
 
 
Since then we have introduced in Europe a resolution scheme that changes dramatically the 
hierarchy of creditors and modifies profoundly the risks for small depositors and the purpose 
of a deposit insurance regime. 
There is no crisis-proof deposit insurance scheme and this conference has been a very 
welcome opportunity to discuss the various models, share experiences, compare principles, 
governance and operating methods. Thank you all for your useful testimonies today. We all 
share ambitious objectives: to address crisis situations, manage the multicultural framework 
in times of crisis, handle cross-border resolution cases, and structure Deposit Insurance 
Schemes to deal with such events and ensure payouts. To achieve these objectives, 
international cooperation, even though it may sometimes be difficult to implement, can be 
highly beneficial. 
International cooperation is indeed of great importance to supervisory and resolution 
authorities and deposit insurance systems (DISs).Globalisation has prompted us to decide 
and act jointly to address the financial crisis and to prevent new ones. We now know that a 
financial crisis cannot be resolved by countries and/or authorities acting independently. 
It is not only a matter for DISs but also for all other bodies involved in financial stability: 
central banks, supervisors, capital markets authorities, accounting standards setters, etc. 
The FSB has taken the lead in initiating reforms and in helping to implementing common 
principles at the local level. 
As regards deposit insurance, the International Association of Deposit Insurers was created 
in 2002 as a direct result of the early understanding of the importance of international 
discussion and practice-sharing between DISs. Progress made in this field has been 
tremendous. 
 
The momentum created by international authorities and standards-setters has actually 
been crucial.  
International common standards are key because they embody common understanding and 
analysis. They are safeguards of the level playing field and of orderly problem solving. The 
Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems drawn up by the IADI in cooperation 
with the BCBS, regularly updated and supplemented for instance by the guidance on ex-ante 
funding, are a perfect example in this respect. 
 
In Europe, we have gone further with our second Directive on DGS (Directive 2014/49/EU) 
that harmonises the reimbursement of covered deposits within 7 working days and with the 
on-going negotiations for the establishment of a Single DGS for European Member States 
participating in the Banking Union. Is a single DGS a prerequisite for a genuine Banking 
Union or is it the final stage to be implemented when everything else has been harmonised? 
In all events, the European stance will be prudent, favouring the establishment a European 
Scheme based on a re-insurance approach. 
 
 
3 
 
It is not only standards that matter but practices too 
Common standards alone are not sufficient because day-to-day work on financial stability 
requires practical solutions that cannot be implemented in isolation by a single jurisdiction. 
This does not mean that everything must be unified but bridges must be built between 
stakeholders, in accordance with their legal remits and constraints.  
At the European level, we pushed forward this approach through European agencies such as 
the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to help 
implement the standards consistently and ultimately by the creation of the Banking Union. 
The latter is wholly dedicated to the practical exercise of supervision, resolution and, at a 
later stage, deposit insurance. 
More specifically, we welcome the completion of the cooperation agreement guidelines 
prepared by the EBA and mentioned in the last panel today. I stress their importance 
because they promote a multilateral cooperation framework agreement and set minimum 
requirements for achieving the rapid and consistent conclusion of the cooperation 
agreements between deposit guarantee schemes (DGS). These cooperation agreements will 
address operational cross-border challenges
1
, such as ensuring that depositors in EU 
branches of institutions headquartered in other Member States are treated similarly to 
depositors in the home Member State.  
The H2C (home-host cooperation) project, which has just been extensively presented is also 
a remarkable new step towards finding and experimenting with solutions to shared problems, 
and this must be encouraged. It is an example of the constructive cooperation between DIS 
operators or authorities despite their diverse regulatory or operational approaches. 
From a regulatory perspective, there is the example of the FSB Key Attributes that have 
been applied through the Crisis Management Groups, with relevant authorities holding 
discussions to find ways to tackle the recovery and resolution of GSIBs. 
 
Practice and model diversity is a challenge, but not an obstacle for implementing 
efficient resolution strategies 
We have heard today that DGSs may still be very diverse in terms of their status, functions, 
design, size, etc. 
This is also the case for supervisory and resolution regimes even though the international 
standards-setters have made considerable progress in terms of harmonisation. 
Let me take the example of banking resolution: one of the (many) remaining challenges is to 
make sure that the adopted resolution strategies will be recognised and applied cross-
border. Under the aegis of the FSB, several initiatives have been taken (e.g. ISDA protocol 
for financial contracts) but this is not the end of the story and many further discussions will be 
necessary to remove all the obstacles to implementing, inter alia, a single point of entry 
resolution of a GSIB. 
In the EU we have now a common legal resolution regime and even a common resolution 
authority for the Banking Union but resolution measures continue to be implemented at the 
                                                          
1
 These guidelines concern (i) the modalities for repaying depositors by local DGS at branches of banks 
established in other European Member states, (ii) the modalities for the transfer of contributions from one DGS 
to another in the event of a credit institution ceasing to be a member of a DGS and joining another DGS, and 
(iii) modalities for mutual lending between DGSs.  
 
4 
 
national level because insolvency regimes within Europe are not unified. Being optimistic, I 
would say that these difficulties are not an impediment to resolution, because the most 
important thing is to be mindful of such a difficulty and to deal with it. 
 
Each of us constitute a vital link for building the proper international regulatory 
framework 
The presence of so many different institutions at this conference demonstrates the need and 
interest to talk and work together because we share a lot of similar concerns and goals 
concerning depositor protection and financial stability.  
We are united by a common goal: to strongly mitigate contagion and make liquidation 
operationally possible. Depositors must perceive the DIS as a well-funded and reliable 
partner able to satisfy their claims in a timely manner. 
But continuous efforts are required. I know for instance in France the permanent working 
relationship between the ACPR, the FGDR and the Treasury to make the French DIS ever 
more effective with regard to these goals.  
I am wholeheartedly convinced that working together, especially at the international level, is 
a key factor of success.
