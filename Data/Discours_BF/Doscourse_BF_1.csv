Th: euro <U+FFFD> bom and th<U+FFFD>. irreversible nature of this change hasnvinced an mcreasmg number of political and economic actors that the 5111ccess:<U+FFFD> the euro is a. necessity for E<U+FFFD>op<U+FFFD>. lt is a keystone of thc European single rnarket which will ensure prospenty tn Europe. It is clear tbat, now and for the future, we havc to face a numbcr of challenses to make this success sustamable. I would like today to draw yourattention particularly to the following two issues First, the euro area will have to face up to a number of challenges to confumits initial success (I); Second, the success of the euro will make a major contribution towards encouraging a more balanced international monetary situation (ll). 1/ THE SUCCESS OF TBE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A NUMBER OF CUALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP A few years ago. it was necessary to convince a great number of skepti.c people, in Europe but, especially, here in the US, that the euro ... vas a viable proj ect. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions and its alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix 'ithout a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some 11a.'i)'Il1IIletric shocks"" (that is to say difficulti.es occurring in a Member economy and not in others ); the lack of sufficient flexibility of the economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries, etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never ex.ist! Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are usefül to help answer the guestion of what are the conditions for ensuring that the ew:o is a complete success. I see four conditions: -Tbe flrst condition is the creclibility of monetary policy guaranteed bv theW.dependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national central bank. Tue euro is a credible currency and it must anä will carefully keep and consolidate the confidence of the 290 million Europeans in the euro area and tb.e confidence of non-Emopeans with wbom we do business. Th.is can only be en.smed by res;sting any kind of pressure on how the new currency is managed. Satisfying tbis first condition will be facilitated, by the hannonious functioning of the European monetaxy tearn, which iscomposed of the ECB and the elcven national central banks of the Euro area.-The second coodition is compliaoce with the provisions of the Treaty and theguidelines l<U+FFFD>d <U+FFFD>own <U+FFFD> the Stabil<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> and Oro<U+FFFD> Pact with regard to nscal policy.Close coordination ot fiscal polic1es and Vlgilant peer surveillancc within theinformal council of the cleven. participating member states - tb.c so-called ""EuroEleven""· and by the m.inisters offinancc ofthe 15 Member States convencd in theEcofin CoUI1cil is essential to ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the eurozoue.Adherence to the medium-term objecti.ve of achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus"" -meaning nobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit - is indispensable for the union as a whole to wcather periods of economic difficulty and for individual cowitries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. We have to understand that monetarv policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overa.11 lcvel of the Economic and MonetarY Union. For my Part. I would give three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. -By coordinatingthe fiscal policies ofthe Member Sta-tes ofMonetmyUDion, thepact ensures a good policy roix within the euro area This is essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the national budgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This calls for close mutual surveHJance and coordmation of :fiscal policies within the area. - Tue pact helps prevent well-run economies :from having to bear unjustified riskpremia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - The stability pact aUows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has noautomatic sta.bilizers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscal posi tion of close to balance or inSlll'plus in the medimn term, the pact enables them to let fiscal de:ficits increase during recessions without cxceeding 'the 3% reference valuc. In short, it allows thcm to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periodc_; that can be drawn on, if an asymmctric shock occurs. -The third condition is tbat all European countries must resolutely undertakestructural reforms. Conti:nental Europe is experiencing high levels of lillctnployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining slightly in most of its economies. Accordingto thc IMF and the OECD, around 80% oftbis miemployment is structt.u""al, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis. Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe its focus onth euro mstead of what they considercd the more urgent task of implementing the;ctural reforms necessary for more dynamic job creation. These critics were wrong · regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assesSI11ent ofthe problcms oftb.e European economy is obviously correct. Tue eurowill complement, rather than detract from, structural rcfonns. Most importantly, a smgle clß'ency will ease the tlow of goods, services and capital within the eurozone. ,And the euro will also encourage ""cross fertilization"" of best practices through stronger coordination of member states policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, work and job creation inccntives, effective welfare safety nets, etc . .In this sense, th.e euro-which is in itself a major structural reform-rnust, and will certainlY, bring about other structural reforms. -The fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must beclearsighted with regard to the crucial qucstion of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy rneant in particular monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and tb.e foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Govemments thus received constant and to a large extent real time feedback on key inclicators affecting national economic pcrformance and could react accordingly. These indicators remain on the euro-wide level: this is why the coordination offiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. But thcy have disappeared at the national level with the advent of the euro, whilst the rules of a market cconomy continue to apply to each economy participating in the Euro zone. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services tbey feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various coun1ries accorcling to the relative competitiveness of these locations. Therefore the leaders of each national economy mu.st monitor competitiveness through indicators of competitiveness such as unit production costs, the ta.x and rcgulatory framework and so forth. This is even rnore importänt than before. Now contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competiti.veness will not; show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal account s, foreign exchange markets and interest rates markets, so policy·makers must be even more vigilant in watching other indicators. Tue sanctions for economic policy errors might come morc slowly end insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. Before tuming to the role of tb.e euro in tb.e jntemational monetary system, let <U+FFFD>e just stress tbat these conditions are at the heart of the ESCB message to other European a.uthorities. As a matter of fact. when we decided, on April the 8th, to lowerthe ECB's key interest rates by SO basis points, to 2,5%, we stressed that this decision was based on a longer term. stability-orientcd course and we invited those responsible for othcr policy areas to take the necessary steps to improve longer-term growth prospects for thc euro area 1hrough decisively adhering to the aims of the Stability -5-and Growth Pact and through embarking on convincing structural refonns in theeconomy. W THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL VIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETIJRECONOMIC AND MONET ARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD.In the cuuent <iverall economic situation, the success ofthe euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from Europeai1 prosperity and growth as part of a healthy world economy. Clearly, tbe new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequenccs not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. The Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through tbe developmcnt ofbalanced economic relationships inside the euro area and ,;ivith the countries outside the European Union, and through the reinforcement of international financial and monetary stability. A. EMU will bclp to set balanced economic rclationships.a). Tbe relationsbip bctween mooetary union and the otber European colllltries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of tbe European Coinmunity is required by the Treaty and is necessary for the European Union to function propcrly at the economic level. It is important tbat the dialogue between all EU countries continue.s, even though the cbangeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. Inparticu1ar, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the coun1ries that have not yct joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area The new excllange-rate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concerned (tbis is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1st J 999) will play its part in tbis process. By promoting exchange­rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will belp the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. b), ne Monetary Union will also have close relationsbips with countrics outside the European Union. First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for our neighbours from c·entra1 Europe. The results achieved by some of thcm during the last year.s show remarkable improvcments. They must keep on -6-makin& an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is in theirown interest and in the interest of cUll'Cirt EU member states,With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustaioable economic growth for so<U+FFFD>e290 million inhabitants, and it will definitely play its important part in the intcmational commwüty. The euro will malce the international policy cooperationproccss easier amo<U+FFFD>g <U+FFFD>e m<U+FFFD> fartners • the United States, Japan, and the Euroarca. Each ofthem Js m a pos1tion to speak on behalf of a !arge ecooomic area. Moreover, each partner is vuln<U+FFFD>rable to a rather similar degree to adverse shoc.Jcs occurring in the international financial system. Therefore the euro should induce a balanced relationshlp in which each partner will take on responsibility for contn'buting to a stable global environment. This major institutional change in the architecture of the international monetary system has made it necessary, to settle the issue of the international representation ofthe ESCB. c). lntemational representation ofthe ESCB As a result of tbe association of the National Central Banks which compose it, the ESCB en joys very close bilateral relations with other CentralBanlcs in the world and is already represented in international institutions andfora. Some decisions are still under consideration, but agreements have becn reached on the main practical arrangements, for ESCB representation. with the Intemati.onal Monetary Fund (IMF) which has granted an observer status to the ECB -, the Baclc for lritemational Settlements (BIS), the Organisation für Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) andin the G-7 and G-10 context. B .EMU will reinforce monetary and fmanciaJ stability a). The international role ofthe euro. With regard to the international role of the euro, let me say that the ESCB takes a neutral stance. The international role of a currency is a complex matter. A currency cao be used by different groups of cconomic agents for different pUipOses, as an anchor and reserve currency on the official side, ancl, as an invoicing and payment currency for international trade, as weil as currency of denomination for financial assets, on the private side. At any rate, it will .?11ce time for the euro to develop its rote as an international currency in its various functions. -7-1 ' As far as thc future share of the euro in thc overall official reserves is concemed, it may be expected that cen1ral banks of non-elll'O area countries will prosn:ssiv:lY reassess . f:beir reserve m_anagement stratcgy according to the diversi:fication opporturutics offered by this new currcncy. Besides, the euro might play a greater role as an anchor cunency for other European countries which intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro. & far as the private use of ßi<U+FFFD> euro is concemed, economic agcnts may use euro to hedge tbeir risks through portfolio diversification. If international mvestors and borrowers consider <U+FFFD> tbc euro will remain a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimize the risks in their intemationally divcrsified portfolios. Moreover a broad and liquid euro financial market will progressively Iead to a widespread usc of the euro, which, in turn, would facilitatc its development as a currency for trade and commodity pricing. Toe euro will progressively develop, over time, as an jnternational cU1TeDcy widely used by the private sector, although the pace of intemationalisation may vary dcpending on the :function. b) The exchange rate relationships of the euro area vis a vis key gJobalcurrencies.As regards the exchange r;tte relationslrips of thc Euro vis a vis other n1ajor global currencies, namely tlie Dollar aod the Yen, I think that one shou:ld never forget the following : . in a floating exchange system the stability of the exchange rate depends on fundamentals. Therefore sound and wise policies in tbe monetary and in tbe fiscal arcas are the best recipe for an cmpropriate functioning of the international monetary system. From that standpoint, it is encouraging to note that on both sides of the Atl<U+FFFD>c we share the same overall concept of a cUIICncy which keeps its value ovcr time and a budget aimed at being close to balance or in surplus. 1 On top of sowid fundamentals, wbich are decisive, we need to pursue and reinforce international cooperation. This cooperation has proved useful during the last fifteen years. Taking stock of thc experience and lcssons of the last years, this international co•operation can probably be improved further; and the fact that thrce currencies of the 07 cotintrics bave now merged in the euro could and 1 1 ' • should inake this co--operation easicr, and more and morc effect1ve. In tbis perspective I would! like to draw yom attention to tbree principles, which are key for international. <U+FFFD>operation to be efficient i • tb.e fin.1 principle we all have to stick to is the r<U+FFFD>:::pect of the noti<U+FFFD>n thatthe fundamentals are conmiandiBg the evolution of the exchange rates m the medium and long term. --8-1 /. 11 1the second principle is the necessitv to work out a cJear consensus ainong all psrtners concerned, namely the executive branches and independentmonetazy authorities of the various monetarv areas concemed.- !he third princjple is the Jesp<U+FFFD><U+FFFD>t of wbat I would call verbal discipline.ML_'ll'kets can be troubled by risky. h<U+FFFD>terogeneous or contradictory statements. On <U+FFFD>. contrary they are impressed by the cohesion and coherence of statements <U+FFFD>ticldng to joint '<U+FFFD>enns ofreferepc<U+FFFD>"". * ! 1 •; . 1 ' 1 In conclusion, Jet me stress tbree ppfuts: Aß regards the European <U+FFFD>entral Bank and the European System of Central Banks, I would like to suggest a met.aphor which might be of help to illustrate our views. There is a morietary team of Europe. composed of twelve players, the ECB and the · 11· National Central Banks. lt is tbis füll. twelve­member monetary team whlch is piaying on the field, with a single team spi,tit and this team spirit is one of the pmceless assets ofEurope. ' 1 Secondly, the intematiOllal Joncertation in tbe framework, inter alia, of the 07, has brought further progress/ in strengthenuig the international financial architecture. There is sometimes to<U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>uch emphasis being put, m my view, on the different feelings or positions, tha<U+FFFD> appear here and there. What l think is more important is the fact that the international community fully agrees on many key issues. Let me just mention tbe thbcs on which we agreed: tbe importance of principles of ""good practice""· in/ the field of social policy, the reinforced supervision of Highly Leveraged In'stitutions (incJuding hedge fimds), tbe creation of tb.e Financial Stability Forum) the organisation of two seminars with the ernerging countries in March and .A.pril, the organization of a preparatorv meeting ofthe Interim Committee ... · 1 . I would lilce 1D sttcss ·J.. Jirit in particular, the spccüic dangen thal areassociated with the ""herd instmct"" of operators, investors and marlcets. This ""herd behaviour"" has been observed:ciuribg the last 18 months both as rcgards investors' attitudes vis a vis cmerging e&,notrues in transition and ccrtainly also as regards markets of the industrialise,fcbuntries themselves. The ""herd instinct"" might be one of the worst enemies wh<U+FFFD> wJ are aimipg at global financial stability. In myopinion, one of the best rebipes for countering that herd behaviom is füll transparency of each partic'ular leotity. of each particular country. of each particular borrower, of eaeh paiticular signature. Only füll and reliable trans.parency for all, both pUblicl ahd private-sector entities, permits a proper iudgement of the merits of eäch case.f 1 1 1 ' 1 : .. 1 ! ' 1 Tblrdly, as regards our p4 moxiota,y policy, I would like to stre•• tha; we are pursuing a strategy of a soll<U+FFFD> and stable euro, a euro which would inspire confidence. I would also like to sttess that tbe euro has clearly a potential for apprcciation. Y{c will ncver forget that we are responsible for the confidence in thc etlro of all savers in Europe and in the r<U+FFFD>st of the world. lt is because savers trust us that wc can have low, medium and/Iong-term market interest rates. To swn yp. i! is by inspirlng confidence to savers that we can improve confidence in the constituencies of entrepreneurs, ecJnomic agents and borrowers in general. Confidence in the euro is oL most precfous good.","jean-claude trichet"

The euro was bom and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of political and economic actors that the success of the ew-o is a necessity for Europe. lt is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. 11, ..,. It is clear that, now and for the future, we have to face a number of challenges to make this success sustainable. I would like today to draw your attention particularly to the following two issues ¦ First, the Europeans have to meet certain conditions for the euro tobe a full success; ¦ Second, the euro will make an important contribution towardsencouraging a balanced international monetary situation. •"""" •""sEP<U+FFFD>2s-1999 10:07 P.03<U+FFFD>43 ' II THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A Nl]MBER OF CHALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP The successful introduction of the euro is, in itself, a major refonn. But it will be fruitful only if a. certain number of conditions are met, above and beyond monetary policy, in particular regarding structural reforms. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptical people, in Europe but, especially, herein the US, that the euro was a viable "" project. Many people pointed to its presumed contradictions, and i<U+FFFD>s alleged inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achieving an efficient policy mix without a political federation; the impossibility of avoiding some ""asymetric shocks"" (th.at is to say difficulties occurring in a Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility ofthe economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc .. , The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! (<U+FFFD> Facts have refuted these criticisms. But they are useful to help answer th.e question of what are the conditions for ensuring that the euro is a complete success. I see four ca_nditions:-The first condition is the credibility of monetaQ:'. policy guaranteed by theindependence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in theMaastricht Treaty and rooted in the independence of each national centralbank. If the euro is to be a credible currency, it must win the con.fidence ofthe 290 million Europeans in the euro area and also the confidence of non-. .

This can only be ensured by resisting any kind of pressure, including political, on how the new currency is managed. The necessary dialogue between monetary policy officials and economic policy officials must tak.e the independence of the ESCB into account and also the objective of price stability which, according to the Treaty, must guide the rnonetary policy of the euro area. The respect for the independence of the monetary policy is a condition for the success of the "" euro, in particular in the framework of the ''Cologne <U+FFFD>rocess""­macroeconomic dialogue for the implementation of !he employment Pact­adopted at the last European Council. r. Satisfying this first conclition related to the credibility and the independence ofthe monetary policy, will be facilitated by the harmonious functioning of the European monetary team, which is composed of the ECB and the national central banks from the eleven founding countries. -The second condition is compliance with the provisions of the Treaty andthe guidelines laid down in the Sta<U+FFFD>ility and Growth Pact with regard tofiscal policy. Close coordination of fiscal policies and vigilant peersurveillance within the informal council of the eleven participating memberstates - the ""Euro Eleven Club""- and by the ministers of finance of the 15Member States convened in the Ecofin Council is essential to ensure abalanced policy mix throughout the eurozone. The medium-term objectiveof achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surplus"" -meansnobody gets to run a selfish budget deficit. To comply with this objective isregu. de - - -Fa>< gu. ae • ._ .. c.,· .., . .,,,-.d 1<U+FFFD>:5z J:'g: 6/.L·a- i- 1<U+FFFD>, .•. ._. .Jt' :r:1 .J.;:) • ;:)G, C!:J · =>,.- .L<U+FFFD>.l ., p_O,F;/1,.d ,-a>< re5EP-2s-1999 10: 08 • 5 indispensable for the union as a whole to weather periods of economic difficulty an.d for individual countries to withstand possible economic downtums which affect only their own economy. lt is the adhesion of all the European governments to the Stability and Growth Pact that allowed the nationai central banks, and the GovemingCouncil of the ECB to decide, last April, to lower the ECB's key interest rates from 3% to 2.5%, in order to provide the euro area with extremely favourable monetary conditions . We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic an.d Monetary Union. For my part, I would give tbree economic justi:fications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact. - First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of MonetaryUnion, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the euro area. This is(' essential for monetary policy. Since Europe does not have a significantfederal budget, just as it has no federal govemment, the sum of the nationalbudgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This callsfor close mutual surveillance and coordination of fiscal policies within thearea.' P.05/i4·1 u de: fai< ""8§EP_29-1999 10: 09g: bl .1.·a P.06/14' e _ Then, the pact helps prevent well-run economies from having to bear unjustified risk premia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits. - Finally, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euroarea has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to amember economy. Indeed, by urging govemments to aim for a fiscalposition of close to balance or in surplus in the medium term, the pactenables them to let :fiscal deficits increase during recessions without<U+FFFD> exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to creat<U+FFFD> a :fiscalbuffer during nonnal economic periods that can be drawn on, if anasymetric sbock occurs.-The third condition is that all European countries must resolutelyundertake structural reforms. Continental Europe is experiencing too highlevels of unemployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has beendeclining slightly in most of its econo.mies. According to the IMF and theOECD, around 80% ofthis unemployment is structural, that is, generated byour own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council ofthe Banque de France agrees with this analysis.Just recently, some extemal observers were still reproaching Europe to focus its efforts and political energy on the euro, instead of implementing the structural reforms necessary for more dynamic j ob creation. These critics were wrang regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assessment of the problems of the European economy is obviously correct. ., P.07/147 • The euro will complement, rather than detract from, structural reforms.Most importantly, a single currency will ease the flow of goods, servicesand capital within the eurozone. And the euro will also encourage ""crossfertilization"" · of best practices through stronger coordination of memberstates policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, workand job creation incentives, effective <U+FFFD>.,elfare safety nets, etc . .It is the reasonwhy European Council meeting in Luxemburg has decided to take thisnecessity into account and has explicitly mentioned structural policiesamong the items selected for reinforced coordination.-Tbe fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must <U+FFFD>eclearsighted with regard to the crucial question of competitiveness. Pre-euroeconomic policy meant monitoring trade balances, the balance of paymentsand the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thusreceived constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economicperformance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensible,multiple and very reactive.Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level or have seen their significance weakened, with the advent of the euro. But, of course, they remain on the euro-wide level. This is why the coordination of fiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. Nevertheless, the rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. 8 Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. The leaders of each national economy must therefore monitor competitivenesseven more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs, companies investments, and the tax and regulatory framework. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up so quickly on radar screens like extemal accounts and foreign exchange markets, so economic managers must be even more vigilant in watching r other indicators. The sanctions for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. II/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL YIELD A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO A BETTER ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD. In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will greatly help both Europe and the rest of the world which will benefit from European prosperity and growth as part of a health.y world economy. Clearly, the new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching consequences not only for Europe and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. Tue Euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through the development of balanced economic relationships inside the euro fl area and with the countries out<U+FFFD>ide the European Union, and through thereinforcement of international financial and monetary stability.EMU will help to set balanced economic relationships. The relationsbip between monetary union and the other European countries will be based on coordination. Coordination of the economic policies of the 15 countries of the European Community .is required by the Treaty. lt is necessary for the European Union to function properly at the economic level. lt is important that the dialogue b<U+FFFD>tween all EU countries continues, even though the changeover to the euro modifies the traditional economic environment of the European Union. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchange<U+FFFD>rate mechanism that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concemed (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the rt Danish krone since January Ist 1999) will play its part in this process. By promoting exchan.ge<U+FFFD>rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will help the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. t The Monetary Union will also have close relationships with countries outside the European Union. 10 :, p,10/14 f · First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive polefor our neighbours from central Europe. The results achieved by some ofthem during the last years show remarkable improvements. They must keepon making an effort to be able to join EMU in fitting conditions, which is intheir own interest and in the interest of current EU <U+FFFD>ember states.With regard to international cooperation, the Euro area will also play a key role. lt represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 290 millions inhabitants, and it will definitely have a major influence in the international community. Tue euro will make the international economic cooperation process easier between the main partners - the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Bach of them is in a position to speak on behalf of a }arge economic area. Moreover, each partner is vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. * * In conclusion, let me stress four points, taking stock ofthe meetings I participated in during the last three days. •l P.11/1411 1/ Firstly1 the global economy is doing much better than a year ago, which is the best demon_stration of an appropriate handling of thedifficult situation in which we were in September 1998. W orld output growing at a pace of 3% in 1999 and 3 ½% in 2000 is pretty encouraging.particularly striking is the fact that the newly industrialized Asian economies are likely to grow at a pace of a little more than 5%, both in 1999 andin 2000. This cails for two ""coups de chapeaun : one to the Asian economies themselves which have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adjust in a very short span of time. The second to the IFis, and in particular the IMF end the World Bank, which have demonstrated in the most difficult circumstances lucidity, determination and courage. I know that saying that is not fashionable. But it is precisely because it is not fashionable that it is worth saying it. 2/ Secondly. this is not the time for complacency. The global economy is in much better shape but remains fragile, taking into account the risks and the challenges that exist, facing the international community. We 12 111ust demonstrate that we, in the industrialized world, can take advantage of a quieter and calmer period to embark rapidly on the reforms that are needed. Amongst the reforms, I would like to emphasize particularly the necessity: - to foster structural reforms in Europe in order to consolidate theEuropean economy and to combat unemployment;- to improve the level of households savings in the US economv inorder to help alleviate the extemal imbalances that are currentlyobserved;- and to continue to reshape the Japanese economy througha12propriate and bald restructuring in the industry.3/ Thirdly, I am encouraged by a number of orientations that have been pragmatically adopted herein Washington in the recent days. I 13 see in particular three elements that are of great importance in my personal view: - the declaration of the G7 on tbe yen, which isJmportant because itcristallizes the consensus of the major industrialized countries in asimple and clear fashion. In my memory, markets have neverneglected such signals of the 07, which are given onlyexceptionally.- the statement on golg, underwritten by 15 central banks includingBanque de France, which states that gold will remain an importantelement of global monetary reserves.- And, last but not least, the solution given to the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries initiative which demonstrates that the internationalcommunity is mobilizing, through all possible channels,appropriate financing to help the poorest overcome theirdifficulties.14 4/ And fourthly, the strategic stance which seems to me the most appropriate conceming the Eurosystem could be summed up with the two keY words of confidence and vigilance, expressed by our President. Con:fidence in our currency, in its solidity, andin a non-inflationary and sound evolution of the European economy, which is displaying very encouraging sigris all over Europe and particularly in France. And at the same time, vigilance, because a central bank must never relax its vigilant stance -it is like driving a car, when everything is all right, the driver must not, even for a .minute, stop paying attention-, ·because <U+FFFD>evelopmeil,ts in the real econo<U+FFFD>y as well as in the monetary and financial fields have to be scrutinized very carefully in the present period, and because structural reforms are more than ever crucial in the euro area.

C'est au nom des liens historiques tres forts, qui unissent les pays europe<U+FFFD>ns entre eux et, en particulier, la Roumanie et la France, que je tiens a vous remerc,<U+FFFD>r tout particulierement de me donner maintenant !'occasion de presenter mon point de vue sur les conditions necessaires au plein succes de l'euro. Le 1 er janvier 1999 s'est produit un evenement exceptionnel dans l'histoire de l'Europe. L'euro est ne. Un nombre croissant d'acteurs de la scene politique et economique sont aujourd'hui convaincus que le succes de l'euro etait une necessite pou r l'Europe. II paracheve le marche unique europeen dent ii constitue la cle de voute, et ii favorise la prosperite de la zone, beneficiant ainsi au reste du monde. Mais, pour rendre ce succes complet et durable, nous devons prendre correctement en compte, aujourd'hui et demain, les implications de l'euro. Je souha i terais attirer en particulier votre attention sur les deux points suivants : - premierement, les membres de la zone euro devront relever un certain nombre dedefis pour faire en sorte que l'euro so it un plein succes;- deuxiemement, ce succes apportera sa contribution a !'amelioration de l'equilibreeconomique et monetaire international.I/ POUR QUE LE SUCCES DE L'EURO SOIT COMPLET, IL FAUT POURSUIVRE LES EFFORTS ET RELEVER UN CERTAIN NOMBRE DE DEFIS La reussite de !'introduction de l'euro constitue en soi une reforme majeure. Mais elle ne portera pleinement ses fruits que si un certain nombre de conditions sont remplies, au-dela de la seule politique monetaire, notamment en matiere de reformes structurelles. II y a quelques annees, ii a fallu convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, tant en Europe que dans le reste du monde, que le projet de l'euro etait coherent. Nombreux etaient ceux qui en denon<U+FFFD>aient les pretendues contradictions et incoherences : par exemple, l'impossibilite de doser de maniere convenable les politiques monetaire et budgetaire en !'absence d'une federation politique ; l'impossibilite de resister a des « chocs asymetriques » (c'est-a-dire des difficultes frappant l'economie d'un pays membre de l'Union et pas les autres); l'insuffisante flexibilite de l'economie et la mobilite relativement faible de la main-d'reuvre dans les pays europeens, etc. La conclusion eta it unanime: l'euro ne se ferait jamais ! Ces critiques ont ete dementies par les faits. Mais elles conservent toute leur utilite lorsqu'il s'agit de repondre a la question des conditions a remplir pour une pleine reussite de l'euro. On peut en souligner quatre : En premier lieu, celle de la credibilite de la politigue monetaire, garantie par l'independance de la Banque centrale europeenne (BCE), scellee dans le traite de Maastricht et fondee sur l'independance de chacune des banques centrales 2 ( nationales. Pour que l'euro soit une monnaie credible, ii doit inspirer confiance aux 292,6 millions d'Europeens de la zone euro, a nos autres partenaires de !'Union, ainsi qu'aux non-Europeens avec lesquels nous faisons des affaires. Le dialogue necessaire entre les responsables de la politique monetaire et les responsables de la politique economique prend naturellement totalement en compte l'independance du Systeme Europeen de Banques Centrales (SEBC) et l'objectif de stabilite des prix qui, en vertu du Traite, doit guider la politique monetaire de la zone euro. L'independance du SEBC est une condition du succes de l'euro et du succes de la politique economique europeenne. En tout etat de cause, le fonctionnement harmonieux de l'eguipe monetaire europeenne, composee de la BCE et des banques centrales nationales des onze pays fondateurs, facilitera la realisation de cette premiere condition relative a la credibilite et a l'independance de la politique monetaire. C'est cette equipe monetaire de onze joueurs, avec la BCE agissant comme un entraineur, qui joue sur le terrain avec un seul esprit d'equipe : et cet esprit d'eguipe est l'un des plus precieux atouts de l'Europe monetaire. En deuxieme lieu, le respect des dispositions du Traite et des orientations du Pacte de stabilite et de croissance en matiere de politique budgetaire s'impose. La coordination etroite des politiques budgetaires et la surveillance vigilante des « pairs » sont la responsabilite du conseil informel qui reunit regulierement les ministres des finances des onze Etats membres participants - « l'Euro 11 » - et du Conseil Ecofin qui reunit les ministres des finances des 15. Cette coordination et cette surveillance sont indispensables pour assurer un « policy mix » equilibre dans toute la zone euro. L'objectif a moyen terme de « finances publiques proches de l'equilibre ou en excedent » signifie que nul ne doit ceder a la tentation du deficit budgetaire individuel. Le respect de cet objectif est essentiel si l'Union veut pouvoir faire face collectivement a des periodes de difficultes economiques, et si chaque pays veut pouvoir surmonter des phases de deterioration de la conjoncture qui n'affecteraient que lui. II faut bien comprendre que la politique monetaire unique ne peut, a elle seule, assurer la stabilite des prix si elle n'est pas accompagnee d'une discipline budgetaire appropriee dans !'ensemble de l'Union economique et monetaire. Pour ma part, je citerai trois justifications economiques aux dispositions du traite qui ont donne naissance au Pacte de stabilite et de croissance. D'abord, en coordonnant les politiques budgetaires des Etats membres de l'Union monetaire, le pacte permet de doser de fa9on convenable les politiques monetaire et budgetaires (le ""policy mix') au sein de la zone euro. Cet element est essentiel pour la politique monetaire. Etant donne que l'Europe ne dispose pas d'un budget federal important, tout comme elle n'est pas dotee d'un gouvernement federal, la somme des budgets nationaux est !'equivalent du budget de !'ensemble de la zone euro. Cette situation rend necessaire une surveillance mutuelle etroite et la coordination des politiques budgetaires au sein de la zone. 3 I 28/02/00 16:59 Pg: 2 Ensuite, par le biais de l'instauration d'un systeme de sanctions financieres en cas de deficits excessifs, le pacte permet d'eviter que les economies bien gerees aient asupporter des primes de risque injustifiees. Enfin, le pacte de stabilite nous permet de refuter !'affirmation selon laquelle la zone euro ne dispose pas de stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de chocs asymetriques subis par un Etat membre. En realite, en incitant les Etats a viser a moyen terme une situation budgetaire proche de l'equilibre ou en excedent, le pacte leur permet de laisser s'accroitre les deficits budgetaires durant les recessions sans depasser la valeur de reference de 3 %. II leur permet de se constituer, durant les periodes economiques normales, un volant de securite budgetaire auquel ils peuvent recourir pour resister a un choc asymetrique. En troisieme lieu, tous les pays europeens doivent resolument s'engager aentreprendre des reformes structurelles. L'Europe continentale connait un chomage encore beaucoup trop eleve, meme si celui-ci enregistre une decrue dans la plupart des economies concernees. Selon le FMI et l'OCDE, ce chomage est, pour environ 80 %, de nature structurelle, c'est-a-dire qu'il est cree par le poids de nos propres reglementations et comportements. Le Conseil de la politique monetaire de la Banque de France partage cette analyse. Certains observateurs exterieurs reprochaient a l'Europe, tout recemment encore, de concentrer ses efforts et son energie politique sur la creation de l'euro au lieu de se consacrer a la mise en oeuvre des reformes structurelles indispensables a une creation plus dynamique d'emplois. Ces critiques avaient tort lorsqu'ils recommandaient de reporter la creation de l'euro mais ils avaient raison s'agissant du diagnostic sur les maux qui affiigent l'economie europeenne. L'euro, loin d'entraver les reformes structurelles, les favorise. La monnaie unique facilitera les mouvements de biens, de services et de capitaux au r- sein de la zone euro, et elle encouragera egalement la « fertilisation croisee » desmeilleures pratiques grace au renforcement de la coordination entre les politiques structurelles des Etats membres dans des domaines tels que: le fonctionnement du marche du travail, !'education et la formation, les incitations a la creation d'emplois, la meilleure efficacite des systemes de protection sociale etc. C'est pour prendre en compte cette necessite que le Conseil europeen de Luxembourg, en decembre 1997, a explicitement mentionne les politiques structurelles au nombre des sujets retenus pour la coordination renforcee. En quatrieme lieu, tous les responsables economiques d'Europe doivent comprendre les nouveaux enjeux relatifs a la question cruciale de la competitivite. La politique economique de la periode anterieure a !'introduction de l'euro consistait asurveiller la balance commerciale, la balance des paiements, les marches de change et de taux. Les gouvernements recevaient ainsi, en retour, des informations constantes sur les principaux indicateurs de !'evolution de l'economie nationale et pouvaient agir en consequence. Les indicateurs etaient sensibles, multiples et tres reactifs. 4 28/02/00 16:59 Pg: 2 Avec_ l'avenem_ent de l'euro, ces indicateurs ant vu leur portee s'affaiblir et pour certains, ant d1sparu au niveau national . Naturellement ils subsistent pou<U+FFFD> la zone euro _da<U+FFFD>s son ensemble : d'ou !'importance des dispositions du Traite sur lacoord1nat 1on des politiques budgetaires et des politiques economiques .Nea<U+FFFD>moins, les regles de l'economie de marche, et notamment la concurrence contin<U+FFFD>ent de s'appliquer a chacune des economies . Les consommateurs creent de<U+FFFD>em<U+FFFD>lo1s lorsqu'ils choisissent les biens et services qu'ils estiment presenter le me 1lleu_r <U+FFFD>apport 9u<U+FFFD>lite/prix .. L_es chefs d'entreprise peuvent repartir ces emplois dans _d1fferentes regions et d1fferents pays en fonction de la competitivite relative de ces . s1t<U+FFFD>s . 11 est done necessaire de suivre plus attentivement encore qu'auparavant les 1nd1cateurs de competitivite tels que !'evolution des coats unitaires de productionet l'environnement fiscal et reglementaire . Contrairement a la periode anterieure a l'euro, toute perte de competitivite, voire toute menace de perte de competitivite a terme, ne s'affichera pas rapidement sur les ecrans radar que sont notamment les marches de change, les marches de taux d'interet ou les comptes exterieurs. Les dirigeants economiques doivent done redoubler de vigilance sur le suivi des indicateurs pertinents en termes de competitivite. Les erreurs de politique economique risquent, en effet, d'etre sanctionnees d'une fayon plus lente et plus insidieuse, par la montee du chomage et le ralentissement de la croissance. II/ LE SUCCES DE L'EURO APPORTERA UNE CONTRIBUTION A UNEQUILIBRE ECONOMIQUE ET MONETAIRE MONDIAL APPROPRIE Dans la situation economique globale actuelle, le succes de l'euro va aider non seulement l'Europe mais aussi le reste du monde. En effet, nos partenaires, notamment les pays candidats a l'entree dans !'Union europeenne, sont eux-memes ,-- interesses et associes a la prosperite et a la croissance europeennes, elements essentiels de la bonne sante de l'economie mondiale . II est clair que le nouveau cadre monetaire europeen a ,et aura des consequence<U+FFFD> de grande ampleur non seulement pour !'ensemble de <U+FFFD> <U+FFFD>urope _et de sa population, mais aussi pour l'economie mondiale et la communaute 1nternat1onale . La contribution de la zone euro a la stabilite internationale passera par l'instauration de relations economiques equilibrees, avec les pays exterieurs a l'Union europee<U+FFFD><U+FFFD><U+FFFD> comme avec ceux situes a l'interieur de l'Union, et par le renforcement de la stab1hte monetaire et financiere internationale . Les relations entre I'Union monetaire et les autres Etats de l'Union europeenne seront fondees sur la coordination. La coordination des politiques economiques des <U+FFFD>tats m<U+FFFD>mbres est requise pa<U+FFFD> le Traite. Elle est necessaire au bon fonctionnement econom1que de la Communaute . 11 5 28/02/00 1&:59 Pg: 2 est important_ qu,e le dialog_ue entre _taus les Etats europeens se poursuive, meme sile pa<U+FFFD>sage a I euro mod1fie l'environnement economique traditionnel de l'Unioneuropeenne . En_ particulier, la coordination entre les 15 pays membres actuels permettra a ceuxqui n'ont pas encore rejoint l'Union monetaire de converger vers la zone euro. Lenouveau mecanisme de change (le ""MCE2"") qui lie a l'euro certaines des monnaiesconcernees (c'est le cas de la drachme grecque et de la couronne danoise, depuis le1er. . 19 Janvier 99) apportera sa contribution a ce processus. En favorisant la stabilitedes taux de change, le nouveau MCE permettra le ban fonctionnement du marcheunique et aidera les economies des pays qui n'ont pas encore rejoint la zone euro ase qualifier pour la monnaie unique. L'Union monetaire aura aussi des relations etroites avec les pays exterieurs al'Union europeenne. L'Union monetaire et l'Union europeenne constituent un pole attrayant, notamment pour les pays d'Europe centrale et orientale. Les resultats enregistres par certains d'entre eux au cours de ces dernieres annees temoignent de progres remarquables. lls doivent poursuivre leurs efforts afin d'etre capables de rejoindre l'Union europeenne, puis l'UEM dans de bonnes conditions, ce qui est de leur interet et de celui des pays membres de l'Union europeenne. En ce qui concerne la cooperation internationale, la zone euro va egalement jouer un role important. Elle represente une zone de stabilite et de croissance economique durable pour quelque 292,6 millions d'habitants et elle aura certainement une influence substantielle au sein de la communaute internationale. L'avenement de l'euro va faciliter la cooperation internationale en matiere economique notamment avec les Etats-Unis et le Japan. Chacun de ces partenaires est en mesure de parler au nom de regions dont !'importance economique est significative. De meme, chacun est individuellement expose de maniere relativement similaire aux chocs pouvant affecter le systeme financier international. L'euro devrait done favoriser des relations equilibrees dans lesquelles chaque partenaire assumera ses responsabilites, afin de contribuer a un environnement global stable. En conclusion, je voudrais mettre l'accent sur trois points:En premier lieu, la posture strategique qui est appropriee s'agissant de l'Euro­systeme, est resumee par les mots cles que sont la confiance et la vigilance. ?e sont cette confiance et cette vigilance qui expliquent notre decision du 3 fevner dernier, lorsque la BCE a hausse le taux des appels d'offre de 3% a 3,25%. Comme l'a explique Wim DUISENBERG, le President du Conseil des Gouverneurs, en notre nom a taus, notre decision s'explique par le souci de preserver, dans une 6 perspective de moyen terme, la stabilite des prix, et par-la meme de consolider les conditions d'une croissance aussi durable que possible, parce que non inflationniste. Par cette decision, nous avons voulu adresser un triple signal de confiance : D'abord, un signal de confiance, adresse a tous les agents economiques, dans la realite de la robustesse de la croissance de l'economie europeenne aujourd'hui. Ensuite, un signal de confiance, adresse aux entreprises en leur montrant que l'Euro-systeme veille a assurer la longevite de cette croissance. Enfin, un signal de confiance, adresse aux epargnants, sur la stabilite et la credibilite de la monnaie europeenne dans une perspective a moyen terme. Une majorite d'observateurs a bien compris la nature de ce triple message. (9 S'agissant de l'Euro et de son comportement sur le marche des changes je rappellerai que nous avons une position unanime du Conseil des Gouverneurs de la Banque Centrale Europeenne et que le porte parole du Conseil des Gouverneurs est notre president Wim DUISENBERG. C'est lui qu'il taut ecouter et personne d'autre pour avoir la position du Conseil des Gouverneurs. Je dirai simplement pour ma part que je ne suis pas satistait du niveau actuel de l'Euro et je m'en tiendrai la. En deuxieme lieu, ii taut bien retenir qu'il y a onze economies composantes mais une seule zone Euro. Celle-ci comprend 292,6 millions d'habitants, a une dimension economique presqu'egale a celle des Etats-Unis, une dimension commerciale superieure, et reflete un formidable potentiel, une diversite exceptionnelle. Les decisions du Conseil des Gouverneurs sont prises sur la base d'une analyse d'ensemble unique de la zone et non au terme d'une confrontation entre des points de vue nationaux differents. L'un des grands defis lances a l'equipe monetaire de l'Europe est que chaque Banque centrale nationale doit non seulement mettre en reuvre de maniere decentralisee la politique monetaire unique dans sa propre (' economie mais aussi expliquer inlassablement a sa propre opinion publique, dans le contexte de sa propre culture et avec sa propre langue, les raisons des decisions de politique monetaire de l'Euro-systeme tout entier. I I' Entin, en troisieme lieu, la derniere enquete d'opinion realisee en France, juste avant l'euro, en novembre 1998, montrait que 80 % environ des Franc;ais, de sensibilite de gauche comme de droite, taisaient confiance a la Banque de France pour assurer la stabilite des prix et du Franc. C'etait la plus belle recompense possible pour une institution independante, et dont l'independance a ete le fruit d'un consensus multipartisan. Les sondes indiquaient, dans la meme enquete d'opinion, dans la proportion de 95 %, qu'ils souhaitaient que l'euro soit au moins aussi solide que le Franc. Des reactions analogues de !'opinion sont observees dans les autres pays. En derniere analyse, une institution independante est responsable devant !'opinion publique. II s'agit, pour l'EUROSYSTEME tout entier, de se montrer digne de !'immense credit de confiance qui a ete accumule au cours de ces dernieres annees. 7 ","jean-claude trichet"
"4","discours","04.06.2000","Speech by M. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France 0 « The euro at fifteen months >> Euromoney Conference Paris, April 6, 2000 r -E Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here, in Paris, in front of such a distinguished audience. I am particularly _ happy to express my views on the successful introduction of the euro, -and the necessary conditions for its durable success. But first within . - ' ' the context of this c~nference on the euro capital markets, let me recall recent announcements regarding mergers or close cooperation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearmg houses, and so forth. It is obvious that the setting up of the Euro is fostering large scale restructuring of markets throughout Europe. The Euro is a strqng catalyst for structural reforms in Europe. On the 1st of January 1999, a unique event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of political and economic actors that the success of the euro is a necessity 2 for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. It is clear that, now ~md for the future, we have to face a number of -challenges -to make this success sustainable. I would like today to draw your attention particularly to_ the following two issues: • F1rst, the euro area members have to meet certain conditions for the euro to be a-full success; • Second, the euro will make an important contribution towards r;; encouraging a balanced international monetary situation. r <-1/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL BE COMPLETE IF A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES ARE TAKEN UP 3 --The successful introduction of the euro is, in itself, a major reform. But it will be fruitful only if some conditions are met, above and beyond monetary policy, in particular regarding structural reforms. A few ye~rs ago, it was .necessary to convince a _great _number ,.. . of sceptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was a viable project. Many people pointed_ to its presumed contradictions, and its alleged -inconsistencies: for example, the impossibility of achie'l.ing an efficient policy mix without a political federation;_the impossibility of avoiding some ""asymetric shocks"" (that is to say difficulties occurring in a r; Member economy and not in others); the lack of sufficient flexibility of the economy and real mobility of the labour force in the European countries etc ... The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! r 4 r r Facts have refuted these criticisms. ·sut these criticisms are useful to help answering the question of what are the conditions for ensuring that the euro is a complete success. I see four conditions: -The first condition is tbe credibility . of monetary policy guaranteed by the independence of the European Central Bank, which is enshrined in the Maastrictit Treaty and rooted in the independence of each-national central bank. If the euro is to be a credible currency, it must-win the confidence of the 292,6 million Europeans in the euro area and also the confidence of other Europeans and non-Europeans with whom we do r; business. r , The necessary dialogue between monetary policy officials and economic policy officials must take into account the independence of the Eurosystem- the grouping of the ECB and the eleven national central banks- and also the objective of 5 r ,. ( price stability which, according to the Treaty, must guide the monetary policy of the euro area. Respect for the independence of the Eurosystem is a condition for the success of the euro and for the success of the European economic policy. As a m_?tter qf fact, the harmonious functioning of the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks from toe eleven founding euro area countries, will facilitate the compliance -with this first condition related to the credibility and the independence of the monetary policy. This is this full, eleven-member monetary team with the ECB acting as a coach, the Eurosystem, which is playing on the field, with a single team spirit ; and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of Europe. -The second condition is compliance with the provisions of the Treaty and the guidelines laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact with regard to fiscal policy. Close coordination of fiscal 6 policies and vigilant peer surveillance are the responsibility of the informal council of the eleven participating Member states -the ""Euro Eleven""- and of the ministers of finance of the 15 Member states convened in the Ecofin Council. Coordination and surveillance are essential for the success of a balanced policy mix throughout the eurozone. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving "" public finances that are close to balance or in surptus"" -me~ning nobody gets to run a selfish ·- -budget deficit - is indispensable for the union- as a whole to weather periods of economic difficulty and for individual -countries to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy. We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of the Economic and Monetary Union. 7 Indeed, for my part, I would give three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and -Growth Pact: - First, by coordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good -policy mix within _ the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy. Since - Europe_ does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has -no federal government, the sum of the national budgets must serve as an overall budget for the area as a whole. This calls for close mutual surveillance and coordination of fiscal policies within the area. We have to understand that monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall level of th~ Economic and Monetary Union. 8 r I"" - Then, the pact helps prevent well-m.anaged economies from having to bear unjustified risk premia by setting up a system of penalties for excessive deficits . . - Finally, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilizers in the event of asymetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim for a fiscal position of «close to balance or -in suFplus» in the medium term, the -pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them tQ create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on, if an asymetric shock occurs. -The third condition, for a complete success, is that all European countries must resolutely undertake structural reforms. Continental Europe is experiencing too high levels of unemployment, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been 9 declining in most of its economies. According to the IMF arid the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment is structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. The Monetary Policy Council of the Banque de France and the Council of Governors · of the European Central Bank are in fufl agre~ment with this analysis. Just recently, some external observers were still reproaching Europe to focus its efforts and politica1 energy on the euro, -instead of implementing the structural reforms necessary for more dynamic job creation. These critics were wrong regarding the untimeliness of the euro, but their assessment of the problems of the European economy is obviously correct. The euro will complement and foster, rather than detract from, structural reforms. Most importantly, a single currency will ease the flow of goods, services and capital within the eurozone. And the euro will also 10 -, encourage ""cross fertilization"" of best p·ractices through stronger -coordination of member states structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, · effective welfare safety nets, etc .. lt is the reason _ why the december 1997 European · Council meeting in . Luxemburg has decided_ to ta~e this necessity into account and has explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced coordinatjon. The Lisbon European Council, held last march 23th, is a further important step towards the necessary medium term strategy for structural reform in the Union. -The fourth condition is that all economic leaders in Europe must be clearsighted with regard to the crucial question of competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring trade balances, the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic 11 performance ·and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensible, multiple and very reactive. Most of these indicators have disappeared at the national level oc have ~een their significance weakened, with the advent of the euro. But, of course, they remain on the euro-wide level. This is also why the coordination of fiscal and economic policy provided for by the Treaty is so important. .: Nevertheless, the - rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness 12 fj even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs, and the tax and regulatory framework. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up so quickly on radar screens like exchange markets, interest rates markets or external accounts. So, economic managers mllst be even more vigilant in watching pertinent ---competitiveness indicators. The sanctions_ for economic policy errors might come more slowly and insidiously via rising - unemployment and weak growth. II/ THE SUCCESS OF THE EURO WILL YIELD A CONTRIBUTION TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN THE WORLD. 13 In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, our partners, notably the United States or the European countries which are candidates to enter the European union, are interested in and associated to European prosperity and growth as .part of a healthy world economy. ~learly, the new monetary setting in Europe has, and will have, far-reaching conseqt1ences not only for Europe as a -whole and its people, but also for the world economy and the international community. o The euro area contribution to international stability may be appreciated through the development of balanced economic relationships between the euro area and the rest of the European Union, and with the countries outside the European Union, in particular through the reinforcement of international financial and monetary stability. 14 0 0 The relationship between the monetary union and the other countries of the European union will be based on coqrdination. Coordination of the . economic policies -of the 15 countries of the European Community is required by the Treaty. It is necessary for the European Union to function properly at the economic _level. It is important that the dialogue between all EU coJ:Jntries continues, even though the changeover to the euro modifies th~ - traditional economic environment of the European Union. In particular, the coordination between the 15 countries will -· allow the countries that have not yet joined monetary union to converge towards the euro area. The new exchange-rate mechanism (ERM2) that links, to the euro, some of the currencies concerned (this is the case of the Greek drachma and the Danish krone since January 1st 1999) will play its part 15 0 0 0 0 in this process. By promoting exchange-rate stability, the new ERM will ensure that the single market operates smoothly and will help the ""out"" countries to qualify for the single currency. The Monetary Union will also have close relationships with countries outside the European Union. First, the monetary union and the European Union will be an attractive pole for the accession countries. The results achieved by some of them during the last y~_ars show remarkable improvements. They must keep on making an effo-rt to be able to join the EU and, then, in due course, EMU in fitting conditions, which is in their own interest and in the interest of current EU member states. Second, with regard to international cooperation, the euro area will also play an important role. It represents an area of stability and sustainable economic growth for some 292,6 million 16 0 inhabitants, and it will definite.ly have a substantial influence in the international community. The euro will make the international economic cooperation process easier between the main- partners - the United States, Japan, and the Euro area. Each of them is in a position to · speak on behalf of a large _ economic area. M.9reover, each partner is vulnerable to a rather 0 similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. Therefore, the euro should fosteF-a balanced 0 relationship in which each partner will take on responsibility for contcibuting to a stable global environment. * * * In conclusion, let me stress three points: Firstly, the strategy that is best for the Eurosystem can be summed up in two key words: confidence and vigilance. It was this confidence and this vigilance that lay behind our decision of 17 0 0 0 0 16 March last, when the ECB Governing Council raised the Eurosystem's tender rate from 3,25% to 3,5%. Our decision was made in order to maintain price stability over-the medium term. Economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade. At the same time, upside· risks to price stability were seen as a reason for vigilance. The decision taken by the Governing Council addresses those upside risks"""" thereby strengthening the conditions for a growth path which is as sustain-able as possible by virtue of being non-inflationary. In taking this decision, we wanted to send out a three-fold signal of confidence: - a signal to -all economic agents of our confidence in the reality of the robust growth of the European economy today. 18 0 0 0 - a signal to businesses of our determination to ensure that this growth lasts as long as possible. -And finally, a signal to savers of our commitment to the stability and the credibility of the single European currency over the medium term. Indeed, observers_ did understand the nature of this three-fold signal. In the occasion of our mo_st recent meeting in Madrid, we agreed that the Gove__rning Council shall continue to be vigilant in order to be in a position,- if needed, to counter inflationnary eressure in a ·timely fashion. As regards the euro and its exchange rate I will remind that we have a unanimous position in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank : the present level of the euro does not reflect the significant recent improvement in the outlook for the euro area economy. 19 0 Secondly, as regards the recent evoi""ution of stock markets, I will recall that central banks have a special responsability as regards not only monetary stability but also financial stability. In this perspective, I wili stick to three short comments : · -First, we have witnessed a great deal of market volatility and _ excessive volatility is never desirable. -Second, '!!e call for investors to assess the merits, chances 9nd risks of their investments after thorough analysis of the -particular entity concerned and not on the basis of an irrational herd behaviour. Full transparency of the market and rational individual decisions are not only theoretically desirable but are preconditions for avoiding as much as possible the successive and contradictory waves of fashion. -Third, I suspect that the generalisation of « Indices based management» strategies should be monitored very carefully, as it probably fosters the « herd instinct » and the « herd 20 O behaviour » which are one of the majo""r problem we have today to cope with. Thirdly, we are experiencing in Europe economic -developments that are fostering major changes in the present mood which is still too « malthusian ». I see three main reasons o for such changes in the european psychology : firstly, major 0 (9 -structural reforms have been launched- the single market, the single currency-; secondly, a technological wave without precedent is boosting, not only the yibrant information technology sector, but also the full body of the economy ; and, last but not least, steady growth is now confirmed here. In that environment, a significant number of enterprises encounter difficulties in recruiting employees and we observe scarcity of skilled labor. According to the most recent survey, this is the case for 35 % of the French enterprises. Not surprisingly, we also note that, in spite of the recent dynamism 21 0 in fixed capital investment, the stock of capital is still insufficient, taking account the pressure of demand at the present level of capacity utilization rates. Not only have we got evidences that · the economy needs more skilled labor and more capital but the full body of the society is now convinced that an acceleration of productivity is welcome. 0 Central banks of the Eurosystem, and the B~mque de France in particular, are steadily antimatthusian. We call for more skilled labor -including by _ unleashing --additional hours- more investment -it is, more than ever, time to invest- and a-speeding up of productivity. o Because eliminating inflationnary bottlenecks is decisive to improve the non inflationnary growth potential and therefore to consolidate job creation and foster further diminishing of unemployment. 0 22 ","jean-claude trichet"
"5","discours","10.10.2000","Speech by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France ""THE EURO AFTER 22 MONTHS"" London, Southbank University, 1 O October, 2000 Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here, in London, at the invitation of the Southbank University, in front of such a distinguished <U+FFFD>udience. I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful e<U+FFFD>Istence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. On 1st of January 1999, a unique event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLEMONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMICAND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE1.1. The euro is based on a credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralized organization of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important aspects : - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the precise adjustment of bankingliquidity and steering of short-term interest rates ;- the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by theEurosystem, both for the execution of the operations and in the field of large-valuepayments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the inter-bankmarket took place last year, right from the start of EMU, thanks to the setting upof the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in real timethroughout the euro area and other EU countries : the system now processesover 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 23 trillioneuros of which 42 % are cross-border payments. These figures show a significantincrease in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introductionof the euro;- the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organization of theEurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact withthe national central banks on the implementation of the operations.The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and by private r financial market operators. 2 <U+FFFD> bl Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Germany towards the Bundesbank, or in the other countries participating in the Euro zone, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six currencies which are now making up the euro - and represent two thirds of the GDP of the Euro area - had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also guaranteed by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the eleven and, as from next January, twelve euro area countries. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as players on the field, with a single team spirit; and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability­oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers, particularly in this country, as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4,5%, for growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with and helps maintaining price stability over the medium term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the Euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large : in particular the yields on long-term bonds 3 <U+FFFD> denominated in euro are clearly indicating that the Eurosystem has already earned a significant level of credibility. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, the President of the ECB holds a press conference - which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website. It is extremely important to stress that the EUROSYSTEM was the first in the world to introduce the 1st January 1999 the concept of regular, frequent, real-timetransparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates to which extent some criticisms are profoundly unjust ! It is very noteworthy, in this regard, that, soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real time transparency, the Federal Reserve System itself decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy - or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to the public opinion at large.In this respect the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to the attention of the national Institutions and national public opinions are decisive. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasonings that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a crucial part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the European and national Institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG is participating more often in hearings with the European Parliament in BRUSSELS than Alan GREENSPAN is on the Hill in WASHINGTON. Each national governor explains in nine different languages, through the grid of eleven - and, tomorrow, twelve - different cultures the same message of the EUROSYSTEM. In terms of transparency and accountability - namely the duty to explain, justify, whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis a vis public opinion for decisions taken - I think that the Eurosystem meets the best standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. The euro contributes to growth in Europe by enhancing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union; or that the lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, which could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any 4 asymmetric shocks and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force ... The conclusion was that the euro would never exist! Facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are now utilized to suggest that the Euro zone economy is full of deep and profound inconsistencies that are putting in danger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint on this very important question? Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily imply that, at any given point of time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Who knows that data on major cities of the US show that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The latest statistics available for the United States confirm that wages and salaries differentials within the euro area are not necessarily atypical for a recently­established monetary union: for example, the average weekly earnings in the non­durable goods sector work out to USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and at USO 644 in New Jersey. Significant disparities may even exist between the regions of a single-state country. A recent article published by the Financial Times presenting the results of the latest official survey of the UK's regions shows, for example, that per capita GDP was highest in London at £ 16,200 in 1999, followed by the south-east at £ 14,500, compared with only £ 9,800 in the north-east. People living in London enjoyed average weekly earnings of £ 520, compared with a UK average of £ 399 and, therefore, much lower earnings in the so-called ""depressed areas"". These differences might not diverge so much from the gaps observed between the economies of the euro zone within an integrated economic area of 293 millions inhabitants. My intimate conviction is that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. This has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations : I would mention authors like Artis and Zhang who found evidence that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, a well-functioning EMU means that all 5 Member States must be aware of the spill-over effect of all their national policies, ( ' especially their budgetary policies. In this respect, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, in full respect of the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly the euro zone is not devoid of the mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact : ( - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. ( - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro areahas no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a membereconomy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. To summarize on that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory which was developed by Mundell as early as 1961, has frequently been called upon by economists who criticised EMU and expressed concern about giving up the exchange rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks - in particular to asymmetric shocks within the monetary union. Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member-country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluationwere valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, I could also. refer to other economists such as Bayoumi and Eichengreen, who suggest thatdealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. 6 II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESSWhile many should acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask, at this point, what are the conditions for a full success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market al The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing impredictible and erratic exchange rates movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of next year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the facilities related to using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for merger and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be the most dynamic in the world : with operations totalling over USD 1 trillion in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. ( c Moreover, the euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered consolidation in the financial industry. This is true both on euro area money markets and on capital markets. (( - As from the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in themoney market increased so as to represent more than 50 % of the total activity inall segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit inter-bank market -which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities- exhibits a very high degree ofintegration. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a keyachievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR haveprovided the market with a uniform benchmark fully accepted by all marketparticipants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market,whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, forinstance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of theeuro interest-rate swap market.7 (_ ( ( These structural changes in the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. _ With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 836 billion euro in 1999, against 634 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. These figures soared to EUR 228 billion and EUR 182 billion, respectively, in the first quarter of 2000. From January 1999 to end-March 2000, according to the Bank of International Settlements, euro area private sector borrowers issued 76% of their debt in euros, compared to an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies as from the beginning of the decade. Similarly, private borrowers residing outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros since 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, fuelled by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, let me recall recent announcements regarding mergers or close co­operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses, and so forth. Had the Euro not been created, would have it been thinkable that the Paris, Brussel and Amsterdam exchanges would merge creating EURONEXT ? It is visible that the introduction of the Euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and in particular the take-off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. 11.2. The Euro is an incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes, earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, 8 r •-<U+FFFD>ffective welfar<U+FFFD> safety nets, etc .. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting<U+FFFD>n Luxembourg in De<U+FFFD>ember 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among theitems select<U+FFFD>d !or reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made afu<U+FFFD>her contnbut,on t? the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Urno<U+FFFD>. The emp_has,s put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issue<U+FFFD> closely: all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms on labour market. With increased capital mobility and a more perfect functioning of the single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be put on the competitiveness issue. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. Authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicato'rs affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. Contrary to the pre-euro period, loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like exchange markets, interest rates markets or external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Busin<U+FFFD>ssmen allocat<U+FFFD> these job<U+FFFD> _ to various possible locations in various countries according t<U+FFFD> the relat1v<U+FFFD>. compet1t1veness ofthese locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the c<U+FFFD>ntext, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. 9 * * * Let me address, in conclusion, three questions : growth, confidence in the future of the euro and the entry of sterling in the euro. Growth: Centr<U+FFFD>I bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with r<U+FFFD>spect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy -price stability- is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. That is the reason why the Governing Council has decided to increase our rates by 25 basic points duri<U+FFFD>g- o<U+FFFD>r last meeting. Wim DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of allof us that 1t 1s important to address potential inflationary risks ""in order to preserve steady GDP and employment growth in the medium term"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations. We are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases -and thus ensure price stability- and to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70%. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in France and throughout Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. Confidence : The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world. In the current overall economic situation the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, Eur<U+FFFD>pe's partners -the United States and Japan- are interested in and associated with European prosperity and growth as part of a healthy world economy. And each partner is vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. In this respect, the recent joint 10 ( • intervention in foreign exchange markets by the main central banks in the world speaks by itself and is self-explanatory. And the communique of the G7 itself is cristalclear ; I quote : ""at the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the US, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada joined with the E. C.B. on Friday, September 22, in concerted intervention in exchange markets, because of the shared concern of Finance ministers and Governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy."" As regards the position of the Eurosystem itself it is equally cristalclear and I cherish a very eloquent short sentence to sum up our consensus : ""A strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". UK entry in the euro : Speaking here, in London, I cannot help mentioning the question of the entry of Britain in the Euro zone. I would like to stress the following points: - first of all, we should never forget that the UK is unanimously and warmlywelcome in the Euro area. It depends only on the decision of the British peopleand of the British authorities to join in. That situation compares extremelyfavourably with the episode of the entry of the UK in the EEC when the UK waswilling to join in and the EEC hesitating to accept her. Everybody on the continentis very warmly hoping for a positive decision by the UK.Secondly, I hope that I have been sufficiently convincing in this exposition that theeuro is the necessary last major tool for achieving the single market that has beenso strongly and unanimously supported by the UK. It is highly paradoxical - andeven, in a way, bizarre - that the UK hesitates to pursue and achieve her owncherished single market endeavour.And, thirdly, let us not forget the figures. The first January 2001, 12 members ofthe European Union out of 15 will be members of the Euro area, i.e. four fifth ofthe member states. These 12 members will represent four fifth of the Europeancitizens, namely 304 million out of 377 and four fifth of the consolidated GDP ofthe European Union. The economic advantages of participating fully in such avery large single market with a single currency are such that economic leaders allover the Euro area are fully supporting this extraordinary structural reform.May be you will forgive me to be so visibly in favour of the UK joining in. May be I have also personal reasons ! Being a French ""breton"" myself I cannot forget that a number of my ancestors were living in Britain. I cannot forget that in the time of the Roman Empire all ""Bretons"" were in the British Isles. And I cannot forget that when a French Breton refers to the old legends of Bretagne, to King Arthur, to Merlin and to Melusine, he refers to a single concept of Bretagne which is merging Great Britain and French Brittany as if the Channel did not exist. Thank you for your attention. 11 -","jean-claude trichet"

At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbankmarket took place last year, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to thesetting up of the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in realtime throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system nowprocesses over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly1,000 billion euros daily, of which 43% are cross-border payments. These figuresshow a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EUsince the introduction of the euro;- the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, inwhich the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the nationalcentral banks on the ·implementation of operations.The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. b/ Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter a/ia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks.

In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Germany towards the Bundesbank, or in the other countries participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, five of the currencies which now make up the euro--and 3 Fa>< re9U de 27/11/00 10 ;jj Pg : 20 represent two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence Is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the eleven and-from next January-twelve euro area countries. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand In hand. The Eurosystem Is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Hannonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part 1Jf the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds , 27/11/1::11::1 .Ltl • .:,.:, denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has already earned a significant level of credibility. d/ Finally, the credibility of the eura al8r.> ra$1.1lts from th<U+FFFD> F11rn:c;y""tAm'<U+FFFD> f'"".nn,:.t;:tnt efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference- which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website .. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 1st January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust I It is especially noteworthy I in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, the Federal Reserve System itself decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinio·n, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasoning that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the·communication of the European monetary team with the European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels more often than Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so in total in nine languages), 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 22 through the lens of eleven and tomorrow twelve different cultures the same message from the Eurosystem. In tenns of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to explain, justify, whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken- I think that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are now deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy is full of deep and profound inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very Important question? Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that 6 inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergence.s of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Ba/assa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the. US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector wurk uul <U+FFFD>l USO fi.40 at the national level, while standir,g at UCD 437 i"" Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey.· I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. In this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained In the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ''as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. 7 t:""_ .. , ............ . Fax re<U+FFFD>u de Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter o'f fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union,the pact ensures a· good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential formonetary pollcy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have asignificant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutualsurveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""EuroGroup'' and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective ofachieving budgets that are 11close to· balance or in surplus"" means that individualcountries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturnswhich affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mixthroughout the euro zone.- Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bearan unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits.- And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that theeuro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to amember economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""closet;e- to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscaldeficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. Inshort, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods thatcan be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks.To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal CutTency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks­in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of 8 Fax re<U+FFFD>u ae 27/1V00 10:33 Pg: 25 EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift ' in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued/"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESSWhile many acknowledge that the Introduction of the euro has been successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to continue ensuring the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of 2001; it will enable not only enterprises but all our -citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. g 1,<U+FFFD>v ••-· Fax re9u de 27/11/00 10:33 27/11/00 10:33 pq ; 27 Pg: 26 b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the 11· economic and financial environmeat. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion dollars in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in themoney market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity inall segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit interbank market­which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree ofintegration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a keyachievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR haveprovided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all marketparticipants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market,whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, forinstance. in the seal<U+FFFD> of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the eurointerest-rate swap market.These structural changes In the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has beensignificant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market.10 L......_ Fax re9u de 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 27 r The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro In 1999, against the aquivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated In US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first half of 2000 at 372 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issuecL,more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses. and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the Increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. 11 11.2. An incentive for further structural refonns 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 28 al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the mason why the European Council, meeting In Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on th<U+FFFD> structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot ·has already been done. in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that Is, generated by our own burdensome rules and ( regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural refonns in the labour market. Wrth increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms wlll become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate refonns. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be put on competitiveness. 12 Fax re9u de27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 29 Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising ·unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions . • * • Let me address, in conclusion, two issues: growth and confidence in the future of the euro. Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the end of the press conference following the ECB Governing Council_on 2 November, Wim 13 -, DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ""monetary policy will not accommodate Inflationary tendencies in the euro area and in this way will make its best contri<U+FFFD>ution to sustainable growth"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-Inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations. We are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to aJJow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy'"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. 1r- We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. ( We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advaniage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. 14 l'aX l't::YU ....... . 27/11/00 10:33 Pg: 31 ... Confidence: The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world. In the current overall economic situation, the success of the euro will help both Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, the euro-area's partners-in particular the United States and Japan­have a joint interest in global prosperity and growth. And each partner is vulnerable to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system. And the communique of the G7 following the concerted intervention of the main central banks itself is crystal clear : ""at the initiative of the European Central Bank, the monetary authorities of the US, Japan, United Kingdom and Canada joined withthe E.C.B. on Friday, September 22, in concerted intervention in exchange markets, because of the shared concern of finance ministers and governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy.n This intervention was followed by several rounds of intervention by the Eurosystem. Interventions on foreign exchange markets are not words : they are acts which speak by themselves. Finally, if I had to sum up the European position, entirely shared by the members of the Governing Council of the ECB and also shared by the Ministers of Finance, I would say: 11A strong euro is in the interest of Europe"".

It is also a great pleasure to rrteet again with my colleague Otmar lssing, between two meetings of the ECB Governing Council. I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, within ten months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary changeover the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. A decisive event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention on why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and on the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: 2 - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in real time throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system now processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1,000 billion euros daily, of which 43% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. bl Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks.

It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosyste~ work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.

In terms of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to _explain, justify, whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken- I think that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up.

Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed around 1.5 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 0 In this regard, we are in favour of co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. But this co-ordination is already contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic pdlicies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be .drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. 8 0 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up theAexchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to ~oint out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If t~e argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the US. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, 0 · services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 0 0 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary insfrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. Preparatory work by the Eu~osystem and by national authorities is on track, not only in terms of technical work but also as regards communication to economic agents and the public at large bl Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion euros in 1999, it is now catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent around 60% of the total activity in all segments of the money market, namely deposits or repos and whatever the payment system used (Target, Euro 1, Euroclear, Clearstream, ... ). The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market. 10 0 These structural changes in the euro area ·money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term s~curities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro ·in 1999, against the equivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects 0 · not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation 11 0 of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets, in the conviction that their implementation would contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and_ to developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the 0 jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. 12 0 0 0 o · According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be put on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. 13 The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, 0 inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. 0 * * * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the press conference following the ECB Governing Council on 151 February, Wim Duisenberg said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ""within the euro area, the maintenance of price stability over the medium term ( ... ) will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled and unskilled labour in order to O • continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and 14 to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we alt welcomed the objectives of the 0 European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy"" skills. This is a very impdrtant decision which represents a conceptual turning point. 0 0 o · We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also antj-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. - As regards our present diagnosis on the situation we are very often asked three questions, namely : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability in the Euro zone ? "" ""What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe and in the US ? "" and finally ""What about the euro on the exchange markets?"". Let me respond to these three questions. To the first one I entirely share the analysis displayed, in the name of the Governing Council, by Wim Duisenberg :"" after the recent slowdown in monetary growth the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised"". As far as the conjuncture is concerned, I think the G7 communique is particularly appropriate to sum up our present diagnosis : ""In the Euro area, growth prospects remain favourable thanks to strong domestic demand"". The last figures we have coming from France are confirming this overall situation of the Euro zone : the January survey of Banque de France has been encouraging as far as orders, production, and consumption are concerned and the forecast for industrial investment in 2001 is + 9%. 15 As regards the US, I share the lucid optimism of the G? : ""Economic growth has 0 slowed, though economic fundamentals remain strong"". A soft landing of the US economy is the realistic working assumption. G 0 6 Finally, as regards exchange rates I will only mention that we are living in a universe of floating exchange system : in such a system exchange rates are not a target but they are a pertinent indicator for monetary policy. And I see only one sentence to sum up our position : ""A solid , a strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". Thank you for your attention. 16 ","jean-claude trichet"
"8","discours","17.04.2001","Discours de M. Jean-Claude TRICHET Gouverneur de Ia Banque de France « L'EURO APRES PLUS DE 2 ANS D'EXISTENCE » Rennes, Chliteau d'Apigne, 17 avril 2001 )AS Mesdames et Messieurs, c' est pour moi un grand plaisir et un grand honneur de me trouver parmi vous aujourd'hui a !'invitation de . M. Cam.bray. Je suis heureux d'evoquer le succes de l'euro et de l'Union monetaire, et d'examiner les conditions de la consolidation de ce succes a l'avenir. -Comme vous le savez, 1' emission des billets et pieces en euro interviendra dans mains de neuf mois, le ler janvier 2002, et l'euro deviendra alors tangible pour tous. Ce sera le plus grand changement monetaire jamais organise dans le monde. Cependant, il (aut rappeler que d'un point de vue economique, monetaire et institutionnel, l'Union Monetaire a ete -.creee le 1 er janvier 1999. A cette date, s' est done deja produit un evenement unique dans l'histoire de !'Europe. L'euro a vu le jour et le caractere irreversible de ce changement a convaincu un nombre croissant d'agents economiques que le succes de la monnaie unique est necessaire a l'Europe. L'euro est un pilier du Marche unique, et il contribue a assurer a l'Europe une prosperite durable dans son interet et dans celui du reste du monde. Je souhaiterais attirer votre attention sur les raisons pour lesquelles l'euro et l'Union monetaire ont, des le depart, ete un succes et exposer les conditions necessaires pour preserver et renforcer ce succes a l'avenir. ,., I L'EURO ET L'UNION MONETAIRE SONT FONDES SUR UNE POLITIQUE MONETAIRE CREDIBLE · ET CONTRIBUENT A ASSURER UN EQUILIBRE ECONOMIQUE ET MONETAIRE SATISFAISANT EN EUROPE 1.1 L'euro est fonde sur une politique nionetaire credible, axee sur la stabilite . a) En premier lieu, il fautt souligner que, d'un point de vue technique _ et o perationnel, l 'introduction de l' euro sur les marches de capitaux, le·. 1 er janvier 1999, a incontestablement ete un succes. Et pourtant, il faut rappeler tousles doutes exprimes ace sujet il ya trois ans. L'ensemble compose de la BCE et des Banques Centrales Nationales de la zone euro a realise l~s objectifs qui lui etaient assign.es sur trois plans importants : - l'efficacite operationnelle, d'abord avec· le reglage precis de la liquidite bancaire et le pilotage sans faille des taux d'interet a court tenne; - la securite fournie par les procedures et systemes mis en ceuvre par l 'Eurosysteme, pour l' execution des operations interbancaires et pour les paiements de montant eleve. L'integration du marche interbancaire est intervenue en 1999, des le debut de 1~union Monetaire, grace a la mise en "") place du systeme Target destine a traiter les paiements de montant eleve, en temps reel, dans l' ensemble de la zone euro et dans les autres pays de l 'UE : ce systeme traite en moyenne plus de 4 millions de paiements par mois, et, en valeur, environ 1100 milliards d' euros par jour sur lesquels 40 % concement des paiements transfrontiere. Ces chiffres refletent la forte progression du recours aux paiement en temps reel dans l 'UE depuis l' introduction de l' euro ; le fonctipnnement harmonieux de l'Eurosysteme qm est une organisation integree dans laquelle le centre de decision travaille en contact permanent avec les banques centrales nationales pour la mise en reuvre des operations. Les rru.sons de ce succes resident principalement dans les travaux preparatoires approfondis qui ont ete menes durant plusieurs annees par les banques centrales et par les operateurs prives des marches de capitaux. b) En second lieu, conjointement avec d'autres facteurs, ce succes technique et operationnel a contribue a un degre eleve de credibilite de Ia politique monetaire unique, qui est garantie, entre autres, par l' independance de la Banque centrale europeenne et des banques centrales nationales. L'Eurosysteme a herite d'un capital de confiance, accumule pendant plusieurs decennies par les banques centrales nationales. Ainsi, en France , la derniere enquete d'opinion indiquait que 80 % des citoyens font t;; confiance a la Banque de France . Le niveau de confiance des citoyens des ,t autres pays participant a la zone euro, envers leur banque centrale nationale, est certainement aussi eleve. II faut . rappeler que contrairement a ce qui est souvent dit, l 'Union Monetaire n'a pas demarre de zero. Il est particulierement interessant de souligner que pendant les douze annees qui ont precede le lancement de la monnaie unique, cinq devises, faisant desormais partie de l' euro et representant pres des deux tiers du PIB -de la zone, s' etaient revelees remarquablement stables, n'ayant fait l'objet d'aucun realignement au sem duMCE. Ce degre eleve de confiance est egalement garanti par le fonctionnem~nt homogene de l'Eurosysteme: l'equipe monetaire europeenne, composee aujourd'hui de la BCE et des BCN de 12 pays membres puisque nous avons accueilli le 1 er janvier 2001 un nouveau membre, la Banque de Grece. Tous les membres de l'Eurosysteme travaillent constamment main dans la main. L 'Eurosysteme est une equipe monetaire unique, dont ~ l'entraineur et le chef d'equipe est la BCE et les joueurs, les BCN, animes par un esprit d'equipe commun; et cet esprit d'equipe constitue l'un des atouts inappreciables de la zone euro. c) en troisieme lieu, la credibilite de la BCE depend, fondamentalement, de sa strategie de politique monetaire, fondee sur la stabilite . Le traite de Maastricht nous a donne un mandat pour maintenir la stabilite des prix. Nous avons choisi d'etre aussi clairs et transparents que possible en donnant une definition precise de la stabilite des prix: celle-ci se C caracterise par une augmentation de l'indice des prix a la consommation harmonise de la zone euro inferieur a 2% en glissement annuel. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons fonde notre politique monetaire sur deux piliers. Le premier pilier, repose sur une valeur de reference -que nous avons fixe a 4.5%-, pour la progression annuelle de l'agregat monetaire large, M3. En decembre dernier, nous avons reconduit ce taux de progression de 4,5 % pour M3, qui est un indicateur important pour stabiliser les anticipations. II faut noter · que le concept de valeur de reference n~impose pas a l'Eurosysteme !'obligation de corriger automatiquement les ecarts constates de M3 a court terme. Neanmoins, !'existence d'une valeur de reference pour M3 va dans le sens de la stabilite des prix et permet de la maintenir a moyen terme. Le second pilier de la strategie de politique monetaire est fonde sur une large gamme d'indicateurs, dont l'utilite fondamentale a nos yeux est d'indiquer ,-pour l'avenir, les evolutions de prix dans la zone euro. Cette strategie assure un important element de continuite avec les politiques monetaires menees auparavant _ par les BCN appartenant a l'Eurosysteme. Elle semble avoir ete bien per~me par les marches de capitaux et le grand public : en particulier, les rendements des obligations a long terme libellees en euros, inferieurs a 5 %, confirment que les marches ont confiance et que l'Eurosysteme a preserve le capital de credibilite dont ii a herite. d) Enfin, la credibilite de l'euro resulte egalement des efforts constants de l'Eurosysteme en matiere de transparence et de communication. J'en profite ici pour mettre !'accent sur le fait que l'Eurosysteme est l'une des Banques centrales les plus transparentes du monde. Une fois par mois, immediatement apres la reunion du Conseil des Gouvemeurs, le president de la BCE tient une conference de presse qui commence par un expose detaille du diagnostic porte par le Conseil des Gouvemeurs et qui est publiee en temps reel sur le site internet de la BCE. Cela a ete le cas par exemple lors de notre derniere reunion a Francfort, mercredi dernier. Je souligne que l'Eurosysteme a ete la premiere Banque centrale a introduire des le ler janvier 1999 l'idee d'une communication regulie!e, frequente et ""en temps reel"" dans le domaine de la politique nionetaire. Cela montre a quel point certaines critiques peuvent etre _ injustes! II convient de noter, a cet egard, qu'aussitot apres !'adoption de ce nouveau concept de transparence ""en temps reel"", d' autres grandes banques centrales ont decide de nous emboiter le pas. Etre responsable signifie, pour une institution independante au sein d'une democratie modeme - ou, comme c'est le cas, pour l'Eurosysteme, au sein d'un ensemble subtil de diverses democraties, comme !'Union europeenne - etre responsable vis-a-vis de !'opinion publique, au sens large. A cet egard, tant les discours et les declarations du president de la BCE a I' attention des Institutions et de I' opinion publique europeennes que ceux des gouvemeurs des BCN aupres des fustitutions et des opinions publiques de leur Etat respectif revetent une importance fondamentale. C 'est en effet ,., un des elements essentiels de notre tache collective que d'expliquer inlassablement les raisons et les arguments qui etayent les decisions prises par le Conseil des Gouvemeurs. On sous-estime actuellement la qualite du dialogue entre l'equipe monetaire europeenne, d'une part, et les institutions europeennes et nationales et !'ensemble de la societe civile d'autre part. Wim DUISENBERG participe aussi souvent a des auditions aupres du Parlement europeen a BRUXELLES gue ne le fait Alan GREENSPAN au Capitole a WASHINGTON. Et les gouverileurs des BCN transmettent le meme message de l 'Eurosysteme dans dix langues differentes et au travers de douze referentiels culturels distincts. C'est potrrquoi, je pense que du point de vue de la responsabilite de· Banque Centrale dans une societe democratique -c'est-a-dire le devoir d'expliquer, de justifier, si possible de convaincre, et en tout cas d'assumer la pleine responsabilite des decisions prises vis-a-vis de }'opinion publique-,je pense que l'Eurosysteme est au premier rang des grandes banques centrales du monde. 1.2 L'euro contribue significativement a la croissance en Europe et favorise le renforcement de la coordination des politiques economiques II y a quelques annees, il fallait convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, non seulement en Europe mais egalement dans le monde, de la certitude du lancement de l' euro. De nombreux observateurs soulignaient ses supposees contradictions et ses pretendues incoherences, en proclamant par exemple que les divergences economiques et les ecarts structurels entre les pays de 0 la zone euro seraient trop importants pour garantir la viabilite de l 'union monetaire; ou que faute d'une coordination des politiques economiques, la zone euro ne disposerait pas du policy-mix approprie, que l'on ne pourrait done realiser l'euro sans une federation politique prealable. D'autres objections ont ete soulevees: absence d'instruments permettant de repondre a un choc asymetrique, rigidite et faible mobilite du facteur travail dans les peys europeens ... On en a tire la conclusion que l'euro n'existerait jamais ! Les faits ont infirme cette conclusion. Mais les memes arguments sont utilises pour suggerer que la zone euro comporte des contradictions qui mettent en danger sa prosperite. Que peut-on dire sur ce sujet fondamental, du point de vue de !'analyse economique ? En premier lieu, l'Union monetaire n'implique pas necessairement que tous les pays participants disposent,-a un instant donne du meme taux d'inflation ou de croissance, meme si le passage a I' euro s 'est appuye sur la reussite du processus de convergence. Prenons, par exemple,' l'inflation. Les ecarts actuels constates en Europe ne semblent pas tres importants par rapport a ceux constates aux Etats-Unis, qui constituent une Union monetaire ancienne, d'importance comparable a celle de !'Union Monetaire. Sait-on que outre-Atlantique, les ecarts d'inflation entre les principales villes ont ete parfois tres importants,-de l'ordre de 7 % au debut des annees quatre-vingt? n Dans la zone euro, la convergence a long terme vers un niveau common de prix conduit naturellement a !'apparition de differences de taux d'inflation, d'un pays a l'autre de !'Union Monetaire. La convergence de la productivite et des niveaux de vie cree une tendance a la convergence des prix, resultant de l'effet bien connu de Balassa-Samuelson. Selon le FMI, cet effet pourrait contribuer a hauteur de 1,5-2,0 points de pourcentage par an a l' inflation des pays de l 'UE rattrapant leur retard en matiere de productivite et de niveau de vie. Les statistiques les plus recentes disponibles concemant les Etats-Unis confirment aussi que les ecarts_ de salaires au sein de la zone euro ne sont pas necessairement atypiques dans une union monetaire : par exeinple, -en 2000, les revenus hebdomadaires dans le secteur des biens non durables s'etablissaient en moyenne a 546 dollars au niveau national, tandis qu'ils ressortaient a 437 dollars au Mississippi et a 644 dollars dans le New Jersey. J'ai l'intime conviction que nous assistons a une integration croissante des pays europeens et a une synchronisation de plus en plus manifeste entre les evolutions economiques de la zone euro. Plusieurs etudes universitaires demontrent que les cycles conjoncturels sont de plus en plus harmonises en Europe. En deuxieme lieu, on s'est souvent demande si l'Union Economique et Monetaire pouvait etre un succes sans une union politique renforcee. De fait, le hon fonctionnement de l'UEM implique que tousles Etats membres 1 ( r. aient conscience de l'effet d'entrainement de leurs politiques nationales et notamment budgetaires. C'est pourquoi nous sommes favorables a une forte coordination des politiques economiques. Cette coordination est au demeurant inscrite dans le Traite lui-meme qui demande aux Etats membres de considerer leurs politiques economiques nationales comme une « question d'interet commun »eta les soumettre a une procedure multilaterale. Naturellement, cette coor~ation economique doit elle-meme respecter strictement l'independance de la Banque Centrale Europeenne et de l'Eurosysteme. Plus important encore, la zone euro dispose elle-meme de mecanismes institutionnels propices a un policy mix approprie : le Pacte de Stabilite et de Croissance comporte, de la part des Etats membres, des engagements importants sur le plan budgetaire. Je citerai, pour ma part, trois justifications economiques aux dispositions du Traite qm ont donne naissance au Pacte de stabilite _ et de croissance : - Premierement, en coordonnant les politiques budgetaires des Etats membres de l 'Union monetaire, le Pacte · garantit un policy mix satisfaisant au sein de la zone euro. Cela est essentiel pour la politique monetaire, afin de pallier le fait que l'Europe ne dispose pas d'un Gouvemement federal et done pas d'un budget ""federal"" significatif. La surveillance mutuelle et la coordination etroite des politiques budgetaires incombent aux Ministres des Finances dans le cadre de l' « Eurogroupe » et du Conseil Ecofin. Le respect de la limite maximale de 3 % de deficit et de 1' objectif de moyen terme consistant a parvenir a 1 1 des soldes budgetaires « proches de l 'equilibre ou en excedent » garantit un equilibre convenable du ""policy mix"" de !'ensemble de la zone Euro. - Deuxiemement, le Pacte permet de premunir les economies bien gerees contre une ""prime de risque"" injustifiee sur les taux d'interet qui leur serait infligee du fait de la mauvaise gestion d'autres economies de !'Union monetaire, grace a la dissuasion exercee par un systeme de penalites en cas de deficits excessifs . - Enfin, le Pacte de stabilite nous permet de refuter I' affirmation selon laquelle la zone euro ne possede pas de stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de chocs asymetriques affectant une economie membre . En effet, en pressant les gouvemements .de parvenir, a moyen terme, a un solde budgetaire « proche de l' equilibre ou en excedent », le Pacte_ leur perm et d'accroitre leurs deficits budgetaires, en periode de difficultes nationales specifiques, dans la limite de la valeur de reference de 3 %. En resume, il leur permet effectivement de creer un « amortisseur » budgetaire durant les phases economiques normales, susceptible d'etre utilise pour faire face a des ecarts ou a des chocs asymetriques, en periode de moins bonne conjoncture. II est interessant d'evoquer ici la theorie de la« zone monetaire optimale », developpee par Mundell des 1961, qui a parfois ete invoquee par les economistes qui critiquaient l 'UEM et exprimaient des craintes quant a l' abandon de l 'instrument du taux de change permettant de reagir a des chocs asymetriques. Le Professeur Mundell a lui-meme, pour soutenir l 'UEM, apporte un eclaircissement interessant au debut de 1998 : dans le cas d'une augmentation unilaterale de la demande adressee par un Etat membre a un autre, creant du chomage pour le premier et des tensions inflationnistes pour le second, les tamc de change flottants ne seraient pas necessairement la voie la meilleure pour resoudre le probleme. Je cite :· « Si I 'argument en faveur de la devaluation etait valable, ii pourrait aussi bien s 'appliquer a chaque Etat federe ou region de n 'importe quel pays, avec une proliferation de nouvelles monnaies, de fa~on qu 'el/es puissent etre devaluees I». Dans le meme esprit, je pourrais egalement citer d'autres economistes tels que Bayoumi et Eichengreen, selon lesquels venir a bout des ecarts s~cturels et des asymetries dans la zone euro ne devrait pas etre beaucoup plus complique que dans une union monetaire etablie depuis longtemps, telle que les Etats-Unis. II. L'EURO EST, EN SOI, UN CATALYSEUR PERMETTANT LA POURSUITE DES PROGRES Si de nombreuses personnes reconnaissent que !'introduction de l'euro a ete dans !'ensemble une reussite, on peut se demander, ace stade, quelles sont les conditions necessaires a la confirmation et au renforcement de son succes a moyen et long terme. Ce qui est tres-encourageant a cet egard, c' est que dans un certain nombre de domaines, I' euro apparait en soi comme etant un catalyseur propice a la realisation de ces conditions. 11.1. L'euro approfondit et paracheve le marche unique a) L'euro permet d'achever la construction du marche unique. L'objectif de celui-ci est de permettre au secteur productif et amc entreprises de 1.., I. realiser des economies d'echelles substantielles, et a toute l'epargne europeenne d'etre orientee vers les investissements les plus efficients. II renforce egalement la transparence des marches et stimule la concurrence et !'innovation au profit des consommateurs. Cependant, l'objectif final du marche unique ne pouvait pas etre pleinement atteint tant que des obstacles monetaires contrecarraient la libre circulation des biens, des services, des capitaux et, d'une certaine maniere, des personnes, en imposant des variations imprevisibles et erratiques des taux de c~ange et des cofits de transaction. La derniere etape de ce processus sera franchie avec l' introduction de la monnaie fiduciaire en euros a la fin de cette annee ; elle permettra non seulement aux entreprises -ce qui est le cas depuis le 1 er janvier 1999- mais egalement a taus nos concitoyens de beneficier des avantages lies a !'utilisation du meme instrument monetaire a travers le continent europeen, a l' instar des Americains aujourd'hui sur le territoire des Etats-Unis. b) En outre, l'introduc~ion de l'euro engendre une mutation profonde de l'environnement economique et financier. L'introduction de l'euro a ete un catalyseur puissant des fusions et acquisitions dans la zone euro. Le marche europeen des fusions et acquisitions est parmi les plus dynamiques au monde avec un montant total d'operations s'elevant a environ 900 milliards de dollars en 2000, derriere le marche americain. L'euro a favorise des mutations structurelles dans le secteur financier, tant pour les marches monetaires de la zone euro que pour les marches de 1 A !'argent a plus long tenne, et ceci permet aux investisseurs de la zone de disposer de possibilites accrues et de meilleures conditions de placement et de financement. - A partir du I er janvier 1999, les operations transfrontieres sur le marche monetaire se sont accrues pour atteindre plus de 50 % de l'activite totale, sur tous les segments de ce marche. Le marche interbancaire des depots en blanc - qui est principalement concentre sur les echeances a tres court terme - presente un tres haut degre d'integration. L'integration des marches de taux d'interet au sein de la zone euro est une realisation majeure qui merite d'etre soulignee. L'Eonia et l'Euribor ont ""fourni au marche des - taux de reference uniforme pieineni.ent :· --acceptes par tous les intervenants. Le diagnostic est le meme sur le marche des produits derives de court terme, dont !'integration, la standardisation et la profondeur se sont accrues. Ce phenomene se reflete par exemple dans le montant des operations quotidiennes et le developpement col}siderable du marche des swaps de taux en euros. Ces mutations structurelles du marche monetaire de la zone euro ont amene les intervenants des marches a concentrer leur activite de gestion de tresorerie en euros et a beneficier ainsi d'une meilleure liquidite sur le marche secondaire. Naturellement, ii faut mener a bien cette integration sur les autres segments du marche monetaire, a savoir le marche des pensions et le marche des titres a court terme. La poursuite de !'integration renforcera l 'efficience des marches de capitaux de la zone euro et sera benefique tant pour les emprunteurs que pour les investisseurs. 1 C - S'agissant des marches obligataires et boursiers, les progres realises sur la voie de !'integration ont egalement ete significatifs. Selon des statistiques recentes, l' euro aurait ete la premiere monna1e d'emission obligataire devant le dollar durant le premier trimestre de cette annee avec 46 % des emissions intemationales d'obligations contre 44 % pour le dollar. De plus, les investisseurs europeens ont considerablement diversifie leurs portefeuilles obligataires depuis !'introduction de l'euro, phenomene favorise par la suppression du risque de change. Cela leur permet d'ameliorer leurs performances pour un niveau donne de risque. Permettez-moi en outre de rappeler la tendance aux fusions· ou aux -cooperations etroites entre Bourses, systemes de reglement de titre, chambres de compensation, etc. Si l'euro n'avait pas ete cree, aurait-il ete concevable que les Bourses de Paris, Bruxelles et Amsterdam fusionnent pour creer EURONEXT? Visiblement, !'introduction de l'euro favorise des restructurations d~ marches a tres grande echelle dans toute I 'Europe. II existe encore quelques obstacles a Ic1: poursuite de !'integration des marches financiers de !'Union europeenne. A· cet egard, l'Eurosysteme s 'est felicite que le Conseil europeen reuni a Lisbonne en mars 2000 se soit assigne comme objectif d'accelerer l'achevement du marche interieur des services financiers et de definir un calendrier rigoureux de maniere a pouvoir mettre en reuvre le plan d'action pour les services financiers avant 2005. L'Eurosysteme apporte aussi son soutien aux conclusions strategiques du Comite des Sages sur !'integration des marches europeens de valeurs mobilieres et accueille favorablement le reglement qui s' en est r suivi et qui a ete adopte au Conseil Europeen de Stockholm de mars dernier : nous sommes convaincus que la mise en place de ces grandes orientations vont contribuer a une meilleure allocation du capital · dans l'economie europeenne et a des developpements sur les marches d'actions conformes aux besoins de la politique monetaire. 11.2. L'euro est un stimulant pour la_ poursuite des reformes structurelles a) L'euro est, en soi, egalement, un puissant catalyseur de reformes structurelles en Europe dans tous les domaines non-financiers : une monnaie unique facilite une comparaison complete des prix, de·s impots, -- .·.-des revenus. Je pense que l'euro pourrait favoriser la « fertilisation croisee » des meilleures pratiques par le biais d'un renforcement de la coordination des politiques structurelles des Etats membres dans des domaines comme les marches du travail, !'education et la formation, les incitations a la cre_ation d' emplois, I' efficacite de la protection sociale, etc. C'est la raison pour laquelle · le Conseil europeen, .reuni a Luxembourg en decembre 1997, a explicitement mentionne les politiques structurelles dans les elements · retenus pour renforcer la coordination. Le Conseil europeen de Lisbonne a apporte une nouvelle contribution a la strategie a moyen terme necessaire aux reformes structurelles dans !'Union. L'accent mis sur l'approfondissement du marche unique, la definition d'indicateurs permettant d'etablir des comparaisons des meilleures pratiques parmi les Etats membres, le fait que les grandes orientations de politique economique, agreees en commun, comporteront un examen attentif des questions structurelles : ,,.., toutes ces evolutions vont dans le bon sens. Le recent Conseil Europeen de Stockholm a confirme ces orientations et y a meme ajoute des themes aussi importants que le vieillissement de la population de l'Union Europeenne et le role des biotechnologies dans la croissance economiqueeuropeenne Tous les pays europeens doivent resolument poursuivre les reformes de structures deja initiees. Il faut reconnaitre que beaucoup a ete fait, en particulier avec la mise en reuvre du marche unique. Toutefois, !'Europe enregistre encore des niveaux de chomage trop eleves, meme si, depuis trois ans, le taux de chomage a nettement baisse dans la plupart de_~ economies concemees. Selon le FMI et l'OCDE, -et les banques centrales partagent ce sentiment- il s'agirait a pres de 75 % d'un chomage structure!, c'est-a-dire genere par un environnement comportant de nombreux obstacles a la creation d'emplois. L'Union Monetaire stimule incontestablement la ID1se en reuvre de reform es structure Iles sur le marche du travail. L' accroissement de la mobilite du capital et le fonctionnement fluide du marche unique vont rendre les entreprises de plus en plus sensibles a l'environnement general du point de vue de leur competitivite quand elles choisiront un lieu d'implantation dans la zone euro. Le mecanisme meme de la localisation des investissements dans la zone euro constituera une incitation importante a !'engagement des reformes necessaires. b) Outre les reformes structurelles, ii convient d'ailleurs d'insister tout particulierement sur !'importance des questions de competitivite 10 Avant la creation de 1' euro, la conduite de la politique economique comportait en particulier la surveillance de la balance des paiements et des marches de changes et de taux d' interet. Les auto rites recevaient constamment des informations sur les indicateurs-cle affectant les resultats economiques de leur pays et pouvaient, en fonction de ceux-ci, prendre des mesures appropriees. Ces indicateurs etaient sensibles, multiples et tres reactifs. Desormais, avec la monnaie unique, une perte de competitivite apparait plus rapidement sur les « ecrans radars » que sont les cours de change~ les marches de taux ou les comptes exterieurs. Des lors, les responsables-de l' economie sont appeles a suivre l 'evolution des indicateurs de competitivite avec encore plus de vigilance. Car les erreurs de politique economique sont desormais sanctionnees plus tardivement et insidieusement par le biais d'une hausse du chomage et d'une faible cr01ssance. Les regles de l 'economie de marche continuent de s' appliquer a toutes les economies membres de la zone Euro. Les emplois sont crees par les consommateurs -totalement libres d'acheter ce qu'ils veulent- quand ils choisissent les biens et services qu'ils estiment offrir le meilleur rapport qualite-prix. Les entreprises - totalement libres dans leurs choix d'investissements - localisent ces emplois sur les meilleurs sites d'implantations, en fonction de leur competitivite relative. II est done necessaire de surveiller la competitivite plus etroitement encore 1n qu'auparavant, en particulier les couts unitaires de production et le cadre fiscal et reglementaire. La surveillance multilaterale exercee dans le cadre de I' Eurogroupe doit permettre de suivre les tendances de la competitivite - dans chaque economie et dans la zone dans son ensemble - et de suggerer, le cas echeant, les corrections appropriees. * * * En conclusion, j 'aimerais evoquer deux points : la question de la croissance · ·· et le diagnostic actuel de l'Eurosysteme sur la situation economique et monetaire. La croissance d'abord : Les -responsables des banques centrales europeennes sont par.(ois presentes comme faisant preuve d'une prudence ,~ et d'une reserve excessives en ce qui conceme la croissance economique. En realite, nous sommes tout a fait favorables a la croissance. D'abord et avant tout parce que l'objectif meme de la ' politique monetaire - la stabilite des prix - ouvre la voie a une croissance robuste et durable a moyen et long terme. Je vois trois principaux canaux a travers lesquels la stabilite des prix favorise la croissance. D'abord, en preservant et en renforyant la competitivite du secteur productif grace a une inflation faible et, par la, des cot1ts de production unitaires bas. Ensuite, en renforyant la confiance des epargnants dans la capacite des instruments monetaires et financiers de bien conserver leur valeur a long terme, ce qui permet de preserver de bas taux d'interet de marche a moyen et long terme. Et, enfin, en encourageant la demande interieure grace a la preservation du pouvoir d'achat des menages due a la faible inflation. Cette derniere contribution a la croissance est a l 'heure actuelle particulierement importante dans la zone euro. En renforyant la confiance de la population europeenne clans la capacite de l'Eurosysteme a assurer la stabilite des prix, nous preservons par la meme la confiance globale des consommateurs et done le niveau de la demande. L'Eurosysteme cherche a atteindre une cr01ssance stable et non inflationniste non seulement grace a son action directe de politique monetaire mais egalement par le biais de ses recommandations. L'objectif d'une cr01ssance durable, soutenue et non inflationniste, permettant de ramener le chomage a son etiage, sera d'autant mieux atteint que !'Europe adoptera resolument une attitude ouverte a l'egard des ""facteurs"" de production - travail, capital et progres technique - qui sont a la ·source de la croissance. La persistance d'un chomage de masse - dont les causes structurelles etaient mal comprises - avait longtemps conduit les europeens a adopter certaines attitudes malthusiennes : la circonspection a l'egard du progres technique car ii serait potentiellement destructeur d'emplois ; le refus d'investissements de productivite supposes contribuer a l'augmentation du chomage ; enfin, la recherche d'une diminution des forces de travail disponibles dans l'idee de reduire le chomage. Nous sommes heureusement en train de changer profondement de perspective en Europe et de nous eloigner de certaines de ces attitudes 'I I r malthusiennes sous l'intluence notamment des nouvelles technologies de !'information et de la communication, et de la constatation que !'apparition de goulets d'etranglement preintlationnistes pourrait faire obstacle a une croissance forte et durable parce que sans inflation. Pour concretiser ce changement d'etat d'esprit, trois orientations font desormais l'objet d'un consensus de plus en plus large, comme il ressort des dernieres reunions du Conseil europeen : - investir massivement et desserrer les contraintes pesant sur le facteur capital. L'investissement est essentiel dans des economies dans lesquelles le taux d'utilisation des capacites de production est a un niveau historiquement eleve et ou une proportion importante des entreprises rencontre des goulets d'etranglement pour la production ; - desserrer les contraintes pesant sur le facteur travail. Pour prendre l'exemple de la France, dans la derniere statistique, 58 % des entreprises indiquent qu'elles rencontrent de serieuses difficultes de recrutement, alors meme que le ~ux de chomage s'eleve encore a 8,8 %. Il serait done favorable a la croissance et a la creation d'emplois de recourir plus largement aux heures supplementaires dans les secteurs ou il y a penurie demontree de main-d'reuvre . Plus generalement, !'augmentation du taux d'emploi, en Europe, de 61 % aujourd'hui a 70 % dans dix ans decidee par le Conseil europeen de Lisbonne de maniere a augmenter la population disponible pour le travail, est tres opportune et revelatrice d'un changement profond d'attitude. - enfm, rechercher activement les progres de productivite qui sont a la source meme de la croissance economique, en etant ouvert au progres technique, a la revolution numerique, aux nouvelles technologies de ,,,, !'information et de la communication, de la biotechnologie, des sciences des materiaux. Cette ouverture a l'egard du progres technique et des progres rapides de productivite - manifestee en particulier par les derniers Conseils europeens - est l'une des cles du maintien d'une faible inflation et de la longevite d'une croissance robuste et durable. - Le diagnostic du Conseil des Gouverneurs de l'Eurosysteme enfin. Je resumerai notre diagnostic du 11 avril dernier expose par Wim Duisenberg en quatre phrases de la maniere suivante : ""La croissance de la masse monetaire M3 s'inscrit sur une tendance au ralentissement depuis le printemps 2000 : mesures sur la masse monetaire --les risques a la hausse pour la stabilite des prix ont diminue au cours -des derniers mois. S'agissant de !'ensemble des autres indicateurs precurseurs d'inflation, les risques a la hausse pour la stabilite des prix se sont aussi legerement reduits ces derniers mois, mais non pas disparus. L'une des contributions essentielles du Conseil des Gouvemeurs de la Banque Centrale Europeenne a la croissance de la demande inteme et done a une croissance economique robuste et durable en Europe est la credibilite de la stabilite des prix aux yeux des consommateurs : il n'y a done pas contradiction mais complementarite entre notre vigilance mise au service de la stabilite et la croissance"". C'est ainsi que nous avons done laisse inchange notre reglage de la politique monetaire le 11 avril. Dois-je enfin rappeler que nous nous reunissons regulierement et que nous examinons !'ensemble des donnees monetaires financieres et economiques ,,., ( ( de la zone dans le cadre d'un processus de decision particulierement transparent. Je vous remercie de votre attention. ","jean-claude trichet"
"9","discours","30.04.2001","C I Speech by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France THE EURO AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS European Institute Washington, 30 April 2001 Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be invited to speak today at the European Institute, today in Washington. I am happy to express my views on the success of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you know, within eight months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will be tangible for everybody across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. Then, a decisive event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market and it contributes to ensure lasting prosperity in Europe not only for our benefit but for the benefit of the rest of the world as well. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the necessary conditions and prospects for protecting and reinforcing this success in the future. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, it is useful to point out that from a technical point of view, the launch of the euro has been an indisputable success. Together, the European Central Bank and National Central Banks of the euro area have achieved the objectives they were assigned in three important respects: - The first is operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and the steering of short-term interest rates; - The second is the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem for interbank operations and large-value payments. The integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the creation of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1,100 billion euros daily, of which 40% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - And the third objective attained is the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work rr conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial 2 r(C market operators. b/ Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has _contrib_uted to the high credibility of the single monetary policy which is guaranteed, mter aha, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several _de~ades by the national central banks. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And in the other euro-area countries, the level of confidence towards the respective National Central Banks is certainly just as high. It should be remembered that, contrary to what has often been said, Europe's monetary union did not start from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two-thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, and had never had to be re-aligned within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is coupled with the acknowledged efficiency of the operational framework. In this respect, the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem relies on the principle of decentralization asserted in the Maastricht Treaty. The Eurosystem is a team, a European monetary team, composed of the European Central Bank and the National Central Banks of the-now twelve-euro-area countries, as we welcomed a new member, the Bank of Greece, on the 1st of January 2001. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and a captain and the NCBs as the players on the field in daily contact with market participants. We all share the same team spirit, and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. cl Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. By virtue of this announcement, we provide a clear yardstick against which the public can judge the performance of our monetary policy. At this stage, may I recall briefly the main principles of the European monetary policy which are sometimes unknown or not well understood. The Eurosystem monetary policy strategy aims to create the best monetary framework for economic growth by ensuring price stability in a medium term perspective. So, a prominent feature of the Eurosystem monetary policy approach is that it does not aim to fine-tune economic developments. Price stability is a yardstick for wage moderation, a crucial element for maintaining competitiveness. A sound competitive position is conducive to a balanced 3 (' and sustainable growth and creates favourable conditions for low market interest rates. To design the effective framework of such a policy, European central bankers have faced uncertainties surrounding either the economic structures of the euro area or the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within these structures. For this reason, we have adopted a ""full information"" approach, which encompasses not only all the relevant information, but also takes into account interpretations that may differ. This monetary policy strategy, which is illustrated by our so-called two ""pillars"", differs in some respects from the strategies pursued by other central banks. In recognition of the fundamentally monetary origins of inflation over the medium term, we have assigned a prominent role to money, which constitutes the first ""pillar'' of our monetary strategy. This pillar is based on the announcement of a reference value-which we have set at a maximum of 4.5%-for annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3. Last December, we confirmed this growth rate of 4.5 % for M3. It is an important factor for stabilising expectations. This first pillar differs from traditional ""monetary targeting"", since the concept of a reference value implies that the Eurosystem is not compelled mechanistically to correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. The definition of a reference value for M3 is consistent with and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. However, monetary developments cannot be the only guide for assessing risks to price stability. We also need to review a comprehensive set of early indicators on future inflation whether it deals with present consumer prices, production prices, unit labor costs, commodity prices, exchange rates, aggregate demand, etc. Therefore, in parallel with the analysis of monetary developments, we also evaluate a wide range of other economic and financial indicators, which constitute the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy. This ""two pillars concept"" differs from so-called ""inflation targeting"", not only because we have assigned a prominent role to money but also because we do not want to be a prisoner of a single mathematical model to foresee future CPI evolution. In brief, we consider that central banks should not base their monetary policy decisions upon any single indicator, model or simple policy rule. Therefore, our two-pillar strategy constitutes a very convenient framework in which to correlate monetary developments with non-monetary factors when assessing risks to price stability. I would also like to stress that our two-pillar approach represents a balance between the requirements of clarity and simplicity on the one hand, and openness and honesty on the other . Furthermore, this strategy ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks. This appears to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the relatively low yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros confirm that markets have confidence and that the Eurosystem has protected the legacy of credibility it has inherited. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, 4 immediately after the Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The conference begins with a clear account of the diagnosis of the Governing Council, which is immediately posted in real time on the ECB website. May I remind you that the Eurosystem was the first central bank to introduce, on the 1st of January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates just how unfair some criticisms are! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other important central banks decided to follow in our footsteps . Being accountable for an independent institution in a modern democracy or, as is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, and those of the Governors of the National Central Banks to their respective national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Tirelessly explaining the reasons and reasoning that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective task. This intertwining between the communication of the European monetary team and that of the European and national institutions to society as a whole is currently underestimated . Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels at least as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. And each national governor is responsible for disseminating the same message from the Eurosystem in his own language. This means that the Eurosystem's message is expressed in eleven different languages and received through the filter of eleven different cultures . To improve its transparency and communication even further, for the first time in December 2000 the Eurosystem decided to publish Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. This is why I believe that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main f central banks in the world in terms of central bank accountability in a democratic society: namely the central bank's duty to explain, justify, and whenever possible, convince and, in any case, be fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for the decisions taken. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptical people, in the United States as well as in Europe and around the world, that the euro was really going to be implemented. Many observers pointed to its alleged contradictions and inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries were too large for a viable monetary union and a viable single monetary policy. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to asymmetric shocks and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real labour force mobility. The conclusion was that the euro and the single monetary policy would never exist! The facts have disproved 5 this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy has some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. How can we respond to this very important question? First of ~II, I must firmly stress that the Governing Council formulates a single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. Each Governor is fully independent within the C~uncil, ignores any national bias and deliberates and decides according to th~ economic and monetary situation of the entire euro area. Of course, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not seem very large, in comparison with your experience here, in the United States, which is a long-standing monetary union of comparable size. Data on major US cities show that inflation differentials have been very substantial at times. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices leads to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samue/son effect. According to the IMF, this effect could have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity and standard of living. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union: for example, in the United States in 2000, the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector were USO 546 at the national level, but USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we will witness the increasing integration of European countries and more and more synchronised economic developments in the area. Indeed, several academics have demonstrated that business cycles are becoming more correlated across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether Economic Monetary Union can be a success without enhanced political union. De facto, for EMU to function well, all Member States are aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. So, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies. By the way, this co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which requests from Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Of course, this economic co-ordination must observe the independence of the ECB and of the Eurosystem strictly. Even more importantly, the euro zone has institutional mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix : The Stability and Growth Pact includes important fiscal requirements for Member States. For my part, I would like to mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: 6 - First, by providing for fiscal policy co-ordination among the Member States of Monetary Union, the Pact ensures a good policy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and, thus, cannot present a significant federal budget. Close mutual supervision and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ministries of finance within the framework of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. A suitable ""policy mix"" balance in the euro area as a whole is achieved by remaining below the 3% budget deficit threshold and adhering to the medium-term objective of keeping budgets ""close to balance or in surplus"". - Second, thanks to the dissuasive effects of a penalty system for excessive deficits, the Pact helps prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium - in terms of interest rates - as a result of other economies' bad management. - Finally, the Stability and Growth Pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State's economy. By requiring that governments aim for a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ·the Pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase in the case of specific problems in the country without, however, exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it actually allows them to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic activity that can be drawn upon to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during less favourable circumstances. Now, it is interesting to refer to the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory which has sometimes been called upon by economists who criticised EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks. I would like to point out, firstly, that one of the most remarkable effects of European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a unilateral increase in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not necessarily be the best way to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied as well to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove any more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established monetary union such as the United States. II. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to confirm and enhance the success of the euro in the medium and long term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. ri-· 11.1. The euro and the single market 7 . al The euro allows to achieve the construction of the single market. Its purpose 1s to enable the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market transparency and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of co~sumers. But the _ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while ~onetary barriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, m a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises - that is already the case since the 1st January 1999 - but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like you do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market is amongst the most dynamic in the world : second behind the American market with operations totalling over 900 billion euros in 2000. The single monetary policy has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on medium and long-term capital markets; it offers euro-area financial markets participants more opportunities and better conditions for investment and financing : - Since the 1st of January 1999, cross-border money market transactions have increased to more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of this market. The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement, which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, which has become deeper and more integrated and standardised . This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the impressive growth of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro-area money market have encouraged companies to concentrate their euro cash management activity within the euro area in order to benefit from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, that is, the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro-area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the long-term capital markets, progress towards integration h~s been significant too, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. According to recent statistics, the euro may have been, together with the dollar, a 8 rr r r • leading currency for bond issuance in the first quarter of 2001, around 45% of international bond issuance for each currency. Furthermore, the removal of exchange-rate risk has encouraged European investors to substantially diversify their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. In addition, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses and other such organisations. Without the single monetary policy, would the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges have ever merged, creating EURONEXT? Indisputably, the introduction of the euro has prompted very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.7 trillion euros at the end of 2000, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure partially reflects the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective, stated by the European Council at its meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of speeding up the completion of the internal market for financial services and of setting a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets and welcomes the ensuing Regulation recently adopted by the EU Council in Stockholm. We are convinced that the implementation of these policy guidelines will contribute to better allocation of capital in the European economy and to developments in securities markets that are consistent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in Europe, in all non-financial domains: a single currency facilitates the full comparability of prices, taxes and earnings. It could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practices through reinforced co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. This is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies as one of the fields where co-ordination should be reinforced. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. Emphasis was placed on deepening the single market; indicators were set to enable comparisons of best practices among the Member States; and it was decided to include a close examination of the structural issues in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. All these developments are heading in the right direction. The recent Stockholm European Council confirmed these orientations and even added key issues, such as ageing in the EU and the role of biotechnology for European economic growth. 9 ( r r All European countries must resolutely carry on with the structural reforms they hav~ alread_y launched. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in p~rt,cular _with_ regard to the implementation of the single market. However, Europe is still experiencing unacceptably high levels of unemployment, although the jobless rate declined significantly in most economies over the past three years. According to the IMF, the OECD and Central Banks, around 75% of unemployment appears to be structural i.e. generated by an environment that hampers job creation. EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a smoothly functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to the general environment, as regards their competitiveness, in choosing a particular location in the euro area. The investment localisation process in the euro area will provide a strong incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be placed on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy management involved, in particular, monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign-exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities received a constant flow of data on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. Conversely, with a single currency, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on the radar screens of foreign-exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers have to monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. From now on, the sanctions for economic policy errors will come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. Market economy rules continue to apply to each euro-area economy. Jobs are created by consumers, who are entirely free to buy what they want, when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen, who are entirely free to select their investments, create these jobs at the best possible locations according to their relative competitiveness. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before, especially through the unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance provided for in the context of the Eurogroup -namely the twelve Ministers of Finance of the euro area countries (a member of the European Commission and the President of the ECB are also invited)- should enable us to monitor competitiveness trends in each individual euro-area economy as well as throughout the area and to suggest, where necessary, the appropriate corrections. * * * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem on monetary and economic developments. 10 ' First, as regards growth: European central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with regard to economic growth. On the contrary, they are very much in favour of growth, first and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy itself -price stability - is paving the way for medium-and long-term sustainable robust growth. There are three main channels through which price stability is fostering growth. First, maintaining and reinforcing the competitiveness of the productive sector through low inflation, and so, wage moderation, and therefore low unit production costs. Second, reinforcing savers' confidence in the ability of monetary and financial instruments to maintain the value of their savings in the long run, therefore allowing for low-, medium- and long-term market interest rates. And, finally, fostering domestic demand by preserving households' purchasing power through low inflation. This last contribution to growth is particularly important at present in the euro area. By boosting the Europeans' confidence in the ability of the Eurosystem to deliver price stability, we preserve consumer confidence and, therefore, we contribute to maintain and reinforce the level of consumer demand. The Eurosystem contributes to a sustainable, non-inflationary, steady medium-term growth not only through central bank monetary policy aiming at price stability but also via all its recommendations. The objective of sustainable, non-inflationary, steady growth, which could force unemployment down to its low tidemark, will be achieved more easily if Europe resolutely adopts an open-minded attitude towards the ""factors of production"" - i.e. labour, investment and technical progress - which are the wellspring of growth. For some time, a persistent high unemployment, the structural causes of which were not well understood, led Europe to adopt Malthusian attitudes, such as a wariness towards technical progress, which was seen as a potential factor of job destruction, a cautious attitude towards productivity-enhancing investment, which was thought to contribute to higher unemployment, and efforts to reduce the available work force in order to curtail unemployment. Fortunately, a profound change in perspective is underway in Europe, and we are discarding certain Malthusian attitudes. This change has been prompted notably ( by the new information· and communication technologies, by the growing consensus on the necessity to augment the growth potential of the European economy through structural reforms, and by the realisation that the emergence of pre-inflationary bottlenecks could be an obstacle to growth that is robust and sustainable because it is non-inflationary. As was confirmed by the latest meetings of the European Council, there is a growing consensus that, to entrench this change in attitude, our strategy should move in three directions to: - invest actively and loosen capital constraints. Productivity and capacity investments are essential in our economy in which the capacity utilisation rate is currently at a historic high, and a large proportion of companies are experiencing production bottlenecks. - ease labour constraints and improve the functioning of labor markets. As an example, the objective set by the European Council meeting in Lisbon to increase Europe's employment rate from the current 61 % to 70% in ten years' time in order 11 ( ( to expand the available workforce is particularly timely and reveals a conceptual turning point; - lastly, actively seek productivity improvements, which lie at the very heart of economic growth by embracing technical progress, the digital revolution, the new information and communication technologies, biotechnology and material sciences. This openness to technical progress and rapid productivity enhancement, which was very much in evidence at the last European Council meetings, is one of the keys to maintaining low inflation and robust and sustainable growth. Let me finally try to sum up the diagnosis that the governing council of the ECB worked out in its last Thursday's meeting and which was explained by Wim DUISENBERG on the occasion of the G VII meeting. Our monetary considerations are based on two ""pillars"": the evolution of the monetary aggregate M3 and its counterparts on the one hand, and the synthetic observation of a full set of early indicators of future inflation on the other. As regards monetary aggregates, we have observed during the last months and until now, a progressive diminishing of the pace of gorwth of M3 which suggests that the assessments of risks to price stability are more balanced than before. As regards the second pillar, there is the slowing down of external demand triggered by the slowing down of the US economy, but continued vigilance is appropriate, due, in particular, to the evolution of wages and salaries and the necessity to avoid the possible second-round effects of the present inflationary pressures stemming from oil price increases and the low level of the euro. This being said, we are pragmatic, we are relying on objective data, on facts and figures, and we are assessing the situation at each of our meetings. I do not want to repeat myself. But I think that the ECB is bringing about a very important contribution to growth of domestic demand in Europe by fostering consumer confidence in ensuring credible medium-term price stability. Thank you for your attention. 12 ","jean-claude trichet"
"10","discours","11.05.2001","Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EURO : A MAJOR STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY NIKKEi Euro Symposium LONDON 5 November 2001 La_dies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to be speaking here today, at the Nikkei Euro Symposium, in front of such a distinguished audience. I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the launch of the notes and coins, which will be a reality within 8 weeks The economic and financial ties· between Europe and Japan have been strengthened significantly over the recent period : European investors and companies have . stepped up their market presence in Japan these last two years ; likewise, Japanese foreign direct investments in the Euro area and _Japanese portfolio investments in euro since January 1999 have highlighted the confidence in the European single currency. I would - like to explain _YhY the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and the conditions and prospects for building on this achievement. I will then discuss the historical event of the introduction of banknotes and coins at the end of this year. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POL.ICY, AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1 The euro is based on a credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) I would like to point out that, from a technical point of view; the launch of the euro on financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success, and that the Eurosystem, made up of the ECB and the National _ Central Banks of the euro area, has fully achieved the objectives assigned to it in the following. areas: - operational efficiency, highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market became integrated in early January 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. 3 l - and, finally, the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, which is an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the ir:nplementation of operations. b) Together with many other factors, this technical and operational succe~s has contributed to the high level of credibility of the single monetary policy which is based, in particular, on the independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks, and on the store of confidence inherited from the latter. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, European Monetary Union did not start from scratch. For no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the twelve currencies which now make up the euro - and represent almost two thirds of euro-area GDP - had proven remarkably stable, and were not realigned within the ERM. This high degree of confidence also stems from the acknowledged effi~iency of the operational set-up of the Eurosystem, which is based on the principle of decentralisation stipulated in the Treaty. The Eurosystem is a team. The European monetary team now comprises the ECB and the national central banks of twelve Member States, following the Bank of Greece's entry on 1 January 2001. All the members of the Eurosystem work in close co-operation. c) The credibility of the Eurosystem lies, fundamentally, in its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by providing a clear definition of price stability: that is to say a year~on-year 4 increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of the euro area of below 2%. The aim of the single monetary policy is to ensure medium-term price stability, therefore creating a favourable monetary and financial environment for economic growth. Price stability offers an anchor for wage negotiators, and is a necessary factor for competitiveness, which is in turn essential for achieving balanced and therefore sustainable economic growth. The euro area is however a complex financial and economic zone. For this reason, we have adopted a broader-based approach, taking into account all relevant data. We have thus based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". In view of the monetary origins of inflation in the medium term, we have assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3, which constitutes the first ""pillar"" of our monetary policy strategy. This pillar is based on a reference value which we .set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. This monetary indicator is regarded as being the most compatible with medium-term price stability. Last December, we confirmed this 4.5% growth .rate for M3. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short ·term. The reference value of M3 is consistent with lasting price stability. Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the ec~nomy and capital flows with the rest of the world. However, trends in monetary aggregates are not in themselves sufficient for assessing the risks to price stability. This is why we need an exhaustive description of the prevailing economic and financial situation. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is based on a broad range of variables acting as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments. 5 Our monetary strategy ensures a continuity from the monetary policies previously conducted by the national central banks, which now belong to the Eurosystem. This strategy has been well received by fina.ncial markets and the general public. In particular, the relatively low yields on long-term · euro-denominated bonds confirm that the Eurosystem has retained the credibility store it inherited. d) Lastly, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts in terms of transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the ECB . Governing Council meeting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference which starts with a precise report of the assessment of the Governing Council, and which is made available in real time on the ECB website. The Eurosystem was the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Other major central banks have since decided to follow us. Being accountable, for an independent institution in a modern democracy -or, as it is · the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle constellation of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to public opinion. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, as well as those by the Governors of National Central Banks to the attention of national Institutions and public opinion, are of vital significance. Indeed, a crucial part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the 6 reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Governing Counc;:il. In December 2000, the Eurosystem decided to release, for the first time, its euro area economic staff projections, with a view to improving transparency and communication. Thus, from the point of view of the accountability of the central bank in a democratic society - that is to say the duty to explain, justify, convince, whenever. possible, and take full responsibility vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken -, the Eurosystem strives to meet the highest standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2 The euro significantly contributes to growth in Europe by enhancing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics, in Europe as weU as in the rest of the world, that the euro would really be launched. Many observers believed that the single monetary policy would never succeed ! Facts have disproved this conclusion. However, other observers still sometimes evoke the supposed fragility of the euro area stemming from the supposed economic and structural divergences between euro area countries. How can we answer this important question? Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating c.ountries will have the same rate of inflatioff or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us take inflation for example. Inflation divergences across countries or regions are quite natural in a monetary union. 7 In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices naturally gives rise to different inflation rates across countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence. Now, present differentials in the Euro area are not very large, in _comparison with those sometimes observed in the United States, which is a long established monetary union of comparable size. My intimate conviction is that we will witness further European integration and, in the medium term, an increasing correlation of economic developments in the area. Several academic studies show that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly, the question has often been· raised as to whether EMU. can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, to achieve this, the correct mix is required between fiscal, economic and monetary policies. In the European Union, Member States are responsible for conducting economic and fiscal policies. We therefore believe that these policies should be closely co-ordinated. Co-ordination is stressed in the · Treaty itself, which requests that Member .States treat national economic policies uas a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Naturally, this economic co-ordination can in no way undermine the independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem. Even more importantly, the euro area possesses institutional mechanisms which are conducive to an appropriate policy mix: the Stability and Growth Pact includes, on the part of the Member States, strict fiscal requirements. I will cite three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by keeping a rein on the fiscal policies of the EMU Member States, the Pact ensures a satisfactory policy mix within the euro area. This is essential 8 r for monetary policy, in order to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and hence no significant ""federal"" budget. Mutual surveillance and close co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Eurogroup"" and of the Ecofin Council. Keeping the deficit below 3% of GDP, and achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the euro area. - Second, the Pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium on interest rates, resulting from the poor management of other EMU economies, by_ setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the Stability and Growth Pact disproves the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to allow budget deficits to increase during periods of specific national difficulties without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it enables countries to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic conditions. This buffer can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during economic downturns. But of course, the extent to which Governments can let automatic stabilisers play strictly depends on the initial level of the fiscal balance; obviously ·countries which still have fiscal deficits have less room than countries with budgets close to balance or in surplus. 9 II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was broadly successful, one may ask, at this juncture, what the conditions are for the full and ongoing success of the euro in the medium and long term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that, in a number of areas, the euro in itself appears to be a catalyst for meeting these conditions. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market a) The euro makes the completion of the single market possible. It enables the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, and all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. However, the ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while monetary ba""rriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will b~ the euro cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only companies but all our citizens to enjoy all the benefits of using the same monetary instrument throughout Europe, just like Americans do today with the dollar throughout the United States. · b) Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong .catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M&A market has been in 2000 one of the most dynamic in. the world with operations totalling around one trillion euro. ( The single monetary policy encourages structural changes in the financial sector, in both the euro area money market and longer-term capital markets. This gives euro area investors greater possibilities and improved financing and investment conditions. - From the beginning of January 1999, cross-border money market transactions increased sharply, to reach almost two-thirds 0f total activity on all money market segments. The unsecured deposit interbank market -which is mainly concentrated on the shortest maturities- is highly integrated. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored; EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have prompted market participants to concentrate their euro cash management activity in order to take advantage of the higher liquidity levels on the secondary market. Needless to say, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets · and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. - · As regards stock markets and bond markets, major progress has been made in terms of integration. According to recent statistics, the euro, together with the dollar, appears to have been a major bond issuance currency in the firs·t semester of 2001, with the euro accounting for close to 40% of total issuance. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios 11 since · the introduction of the euro, prompted by the removal · of the · exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve better performances for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to current trends in mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement · systems, clearing houses, and similar institutions. Had the ·euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges merge to create EURONEXT and recently conclude another major alliance? Undeniably, the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan may be implemented by 2005 ; a . regular review of this Plan is made by European authorities, and progress is well under way. The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securities markets, ratified by the ~uropean Council meeting in Stockholm in March 2001: we are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help to improve capital allocation in .Europe and foster developments on equity markets in line with monetary policy requirements. 11.2. The euro is an incentive for further structural reforms a) . The euro, per se, is also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe: a single currency facilitates the comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. The euro could encourage ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States' structural 12 C policies in areas such as the labour market, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. For this reason, the European Council, meeting in · Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council further enhanced the medium-term strategy necessary for structural reform in the Union. The following developments are a step in the right direction: the emphasis ~n deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which will examine the structural issues closely. The recent European Council meetings in Stockholm in March 2001 and Gothenburg in June 2001 confirmed these guidelines and even added a number of important issues such as the consequences of the ageing population in the European Union, the role of biotechnologies in econom~c growth, and the environment. The European Heads of State and Government, meeting in Ghent a couple of weeks ago, called for an acceleration of the whole process. All Europ·ean countries must resolutely pursue the reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that much has already been done, in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is stiU experiencing levels of un~mployment that are too high, despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been declining · significantly in most of its economies for the past three years. According to the IMF, the OECD and central bani(s, 75% of unemployment is of a structural nature, .i.e. generated by an environment which handicaps job creation. There is no doubt that EMU stimulates structural reforms on the labour market. With increased capi~al mobility and the smooth functioning of the single market, firms will become · increasingly sensitive to the general · environment in terms of their competitiveness when choosing a particular 13 C location in the euro area. The actual process of selecting an investment location within the euro area will be a . major incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b) Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be · placed on competitive .ness. Pre-euro economic policy required careful monitoring of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The . authorities received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could then react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. At present, with the advent of the single currency, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance, as economic policy errors could have slower and more insidious repercussions, such as rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy continue to apply to all euro area countries .. Jobs are created by consumers - totally free to purchase whatever they wish - when they choose the goods and services that they deem to be best value for money. Companies - totally free in their investment choices -locate their business according to the relative competitiveness of the different possible sites. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before, in particular unit production costs, and the tax and reguiatory framework. The multilateral surveillance carried out in the context of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competition trends in each euro area country and in the zone as a whole and, where necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. 14 ,. l Ill. A SMOOTH CHANGEOVER TO THE EURO WILL ALSO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR FOR EUROPEANS' CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CURRENCY Of course, the Eurosystem is at the heart of the euro cash changeover process. Our challenge consists in replacing all national monetary units by the euro in all monetary and financial relations of public administrations, banks, enterprises, businesses and citizens. The first contribution of the Eurosystem is the euro banknote production. Today, more than 12 billion banknotes have been manufactured, out of a total of 14.9 billion. The launch stock is almost ready. The manufacturing process has been carefully monitored, in accordance with state of the art security standards. The new banknotes combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro. These security features provide all persons handling cash, especially the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes. Special attention has also been. given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted. The Eurosystem also plays a key role in the supplying process of euro banknotes and in the withdrawing process of former national monetary units. At the national level, each central bank of the euro area works in close co-operation with credit institutions, security companies, shopkeepers and police forces. This fruitful concertation is essential to the success of such a huge operation, on both fields of logistics and security. 15 The ""non-cash"" euro is already in use The final stage of the introduction of the euro will include two changeovers: the changeover to the non-cash euro,· which concerns all book-entry tran$actions (cheques, bank accounts, bank card payments, transfers,· loans, etc.) and the changeover to the cash euro, which concerns banknotes and coins. This summer, banks in France started to systematically convert bank accounts into euros and provide customers with euro cheque books. In various participating countries, in · particular France, all bank accounts have already been converted . It is now up to each citizen in the euro area to establish a new scale of values for the currency and to make payments in euro. In this respect, retailers have a fundamental role to play: their active participation · and their readiness to accept payments in euro will greatly facilitate the euro changeover as a whole. The cash euro will be in circulation within 8 weeks As regards the cash euro, the main task now consists in frontloading the banknotes and coins so that, on 1 January 2002, transactions can be carried out smoothly in the best possible security conditions. To achieve this, · frontloaded coins are supplied to credit institutions. Banknotes will soon be provided to them (as of 1 December in France). Retailers will also be provided with frontloaded banknotes and coins. Furthermore, in order to familiarise the public and to facilitate the giving of change as of 1 January 2002, individuals. will be able to obtain, as of mid-December, packs of euro . coins known as 'euro starter kits' ; these coins cannot be· used for payments before 1st January 2002. 16 As of 1 January 2002, banks will only i deliver euros, retailers will give change in euro and ATMs will supply euro banknotes only. A few days after this date, almost all transactions will be carried out in euro. Beyond technical aspects, the Eurosystem -and also public authorities- have an important responsibility in informing the general public on the challenges ahead, the deadlines and the practical aspects of the euro cash changeover. The success of the global process depends heavily on the confidence of the general public and cash handlers as well. Preparing people.to be well informed. and to feel confident in using the euro banknotes and coins is the overall (~ objective of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign conducted by the Eurosystem. This campaign aims to reach the general public through the mass media. It is closely supported by a Europe-wide Partnership Programme with more than 2 600 national and international organisations. It has now entered into an intensive information phase, since the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features by our President, W. Duisenberg, on 30th of August. As Mr Duisenberg stressed, this event was more than a mere technical presentation, but took on an historical and symbolic dimension. On 1 January 2002, we will have the honour of witnessing the largest currency changeover that the world has ever experienced. This will be the crowning achievement of a long economic and political process which led to the creation of Monetary Union . on 1 January 1999. This unique event in European history will help to ensure lasting prosperity, which is not only in Europe's interest but that of the rest of the world as well. * * * 17 Lastly, speaking in front . of bankers, financial institutions, business executives and journalists, I would like to make the following remarks as regards the present situation: -first, the main message in the present exceptional circumstances, is that the first quality of all Institutions, all economic leaders, all enterprises as well as households is to keep one's nerves. The best gift we could give the terrorists would be to change our plans, to cancel endeavours, to delay decisions, to reduce investment or consumption. We, Institutions, enterprises, individuals had and have projects: let us realize them, in time, and unchanged. -second, let us beware of fashion. It was still fashionable, a year ago, to embark ·on vibrant eloge of the new economy, to predict the end of the business cycle and to forecast for ever very high level of productivity progress and buoyant economic growth. To-day some kind of herd behaviour drives a lot of observers and actors in the opposite direction: overwhelming pessimism as regards the present situation and the economic future. Both attitudes are equally totally . inappropriate. It is up to the Central Banks to remain moderate in _their judgments, pragmatic and lucid in the various circumstances and to offer r an anchor not only for monetary and financial stability but also for stability of judgment -third, fostering confidence is a major contribution of the Eurosystem to the prosperity of the European economy. Confidence is a very preciou~ ingredient in the present European conjuncture, as recently emphasized by the European Council in Ghent : confidence in the euro, in price stability, in its ability to be a highly reliable instrument for savings, in its medium and long term solidity. Confidence of the consumers ·in price stability underpins growth through dynamic household consumption - which is today a m?jor motor of economic 18 -growth. Confidence of the . savers underpins growth through a favourable financial environment. Thank you very much for your attention. • 19 ","jean-claude trichet"
"11","discours","16.05.2001","') Keynote address by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France at the OECD FORUM 2001 on Sustainable Development and the New Economy May 16, 2001 Preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be invited today to this OECD Forum to talk about preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. One should keep in mind that financial globalisation has brought about improved macro-economic efficiency. As you know, the globalisation of the world economy and the development of financial markets were driven by two key factors: - firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced in Europe by the setting up of the single market and subsequently of the Economic and Monetary Union- which liberalised capital flows and enhanced competition among financial sectors; - and secondly, technical and financial innovation, which simultaneously paved the way for the creation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected. What is interesting to stress is that the interaction of free capital movements within interconnected markets, increasing integration of market segments and hedging opportunities provided by new financial instruments have allowed a better fit between the financing capacities and borrowing requirements of both governments, households and companies . The use of market interest rates, which represent the markets' consensus on the risk incurred at a moment, as a driving force is fully beneficial to an efficient allocation of capital. Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercer competition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of pure and perfect competition, which is beneficial to all consumers. Last but not least, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled directly into investment. Reducing the share of bank financing, and consequently that of money creation, has enabled a less inflationary financing of the economy. Thus increased, monetary stability has produced tangible and positive effects and contributed decisively t~ a strong and sustainable growth of the world economy. Thus, these developments have resulted in increased monetary stability and a more efficient allocation of resources. However, while globalisation and financial integration have decisively contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, experience also suggests that financial cycles may have tended to amplify relative to business cycles over recent years. In particular, financial markets have experienced in some circumstances somewhat erratic developments. The rapid emergence of the ""new economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000- followed by a series of sharp corrections- illustrated the potential of markets for providing funding to the real economy (particularly to the most innovative sectors); but it also demonstrated the tendency of markets to over-react, moving from excessive optimism to disproportionate pessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for the behaviour of firms and households. As a result, financial authorities have been confronted with boom-bust episodes which must be carefully monitored, since they could affect global monetary and financial stability. I would like therefore to consider two issues here: ¦ Firstly , experience suggests that financial cycles may have recently tended to amplify relative to business cycles; what are the driving factors behind this move; ¦ Secondly , what are the possible policy implications of this development, from both a monetary and financial stability perspective. 1. Experienc e suggests that financial cycles have recently tended to ampli fy relative to business cycles. A. What are the major f eatures of these amplified financial cycles? Let us first consider credit cycles. There is no doubt that the amplitude of credit cycles is usually larger than that of business cycles. What is however noticeable here is that, over the last three decades, business cycles have been less frequent and less amplified while credit cycles have tended to remain fairly marked. Thus credit cycles have been amplifying in relative terms compared with business cy cles. Asset price cycles have also become more pronounced even if the fixed interest rate markets have a tendency to be somewhat contra-cyclical. ¦ In the last two decades market forces have indeed tended to cause clear misalignments between equilibrium and actual asset prices . Stock markets in particular have experienced this phenomenon. But in foreign exchange markets as -2 well, prices have also tended to diverge substantially from their ""equilibrium level"", although those divergences have been contained through fruitful GVII cooperation during the last 15 years. • In addition, some markets have seen an increase in volatility and frequent volatility peaks. Although cyclical moves should be clearly distinguished from volatility, the latter may in some circumstances exceed what can be considered optimal, making the price determination mechanism less efficient and thus contributing to misalignments. • Moreover, as demonstrated by a number of financial crises during the last two decades, contagion among countries and across financial markets has been frequent. As a result, investors have faced asset price fluctuations that might be more synchronised than before. • Lastly, the connections between credit, asset price and business cycles have tended to amplify cyclical swings. Credit, in particular, has played an increasing role in asset price fluctuations. Initially observed during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted. Another example is provided by boom-bust cycles in asset prices and credit activities, which have often been associated with sharp economic contractions. · In sum, the recent period has experienced some amplification of financial cycles, compared with business cycles. B. What are the factors underlying this possible amplification of financial cycles? Let us first consider credit cycles : • the first factor in play is the behaviour of banks, which is closely linked to their environment. Some of them may have tended to artificially increase their return on equity through higher leverage or low provisioning during upswings. As a consequence they tend to become more fragile in the downward phase of the cycle. In parallel, investors have become more reluctant to invest in the banking sector when profit expectations are low, making it difficult for banks to raise new funds. Banks' soundness therefore tends to be more correlated to economic fluctuations than in the past, contributing to the amplification of the credit cycle. • Accounting regulations so far may also contribute to amplifying credit cycles to some extent. In most financial centres, current provisioning behaviour does not allow hanks to take a forward-looking view of their risks, as accounting and tax rules only accept loan-loss provisions for impaired loans. Such a regulatory environment may amplify the credit cycle, contributing to low provisioning and over-lending during upswings and paving the way to sharp corrections during 3 downswings. Using full fair value accounting for loan portfolios might further amplify credit cycles by increasing the volatility of banks' earnings. • Prudential rules may also have been unable so far to always prevent these developments. Current capital adequacy rules are not risk-sensitive; as a result, credit deterioration does not require additional regulatory capital unless loan losses erode the capital base under minimum requirements. As most banks -particularly large ones- have capital far beyond the prudential minimum requirements, they can bear a reduction of their capital base without being compelled to restrict their credit granting. Therefore, capital ratio is not pro-cyclical as such. The point is that, even while capital requirements are fulfilled, losses can reduce banks' own funds at a time when capital issuance is difficult or costly; in such a juncture, some analysts argue that banks may be led to restrict credit lending during downswings although they are not bound to do so for prudential reasons. I consider that the future capital requirements of the New Accord will significantly improve the situation as regards the risk-sensitivity of capital requirements. Let us now turn to asset price moves. As previously mentioned, financial asset prices may fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals for long periods of time. Several factors may be in play when this happens. I shall give a few examples. • Some market participants may have become more inclined to engage in ""short-termism"", that is, they are only preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield high immediate financial results that are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market financial products may also have contributed to this widespread focus on immediate financial performances. This focus on short-term performance can translate into additional volatility in the price discovery process: the shorter the investment horizon of market participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. ¦ Mimetic · behaviour is of course by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. Technological developments on markets may however have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour, as participants are increasingly incited to follow their peers through matching the performance of a benchmark. There is no doubt that the spread of benchmarking allows fund managers and clients to better assess their performance against that of other funds. But, in a context of growing competition within the sector, it may well have increased mimetic behaviour. Some economic operators (whose own compensation is closely linked to the relative, rather than absolute, profit and losses they generate) may indeed have come to the conclusion that it would be better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than running the risk of being wrong alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. 4 • Another factor to be taken into consideration is the spectacular development of certain fund management techniques, such as index management. As it has proven very popular on equity markets, index management may have contributed to exacerbating movements in financial asset prices. Because their goal is to mimic the performance of indexes, ""passive managers"" try constantly to match the composition of their benchmark. They thus help to amplify market trends, buying more as the market rises and liquidating more as the market drops. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indexes and that, as a result, the indices end up creating rather than measuring performance. • Last but not least, the impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting . Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standard approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and to set up exposure limits. Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments. But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of sophisticated risk management techniques by financial intermediaries might have had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock, exhausting liquidity and contributing to contagion phenomena. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, we see that their growing use may have produced pernicious effects. When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All those factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 2. Possible policy implications of such developments from a monetary and a financial stability perspective All the factors I have just mentioned require authorities to consider - in conjunction with the financial industry - ways of preserving monetary and financial stability in this changing environment. A. A stability-oriented monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite for the smooth functioning of financial cycles. Financial deregulation has radically changed the conduct of monetary policies. More open economies and greater interdependence between financial systems have completely overhauled the context in which monetary policy is implemented. ¦ Financial markets can now penalise inflationary monetary policies by withdrawing capital, with a subsequent rise in long-term interest rates and/or depreciation of the exchange rate. -5 • At the same time, monetary policy transmission mechanisms have become more diversified and complex. This situation has prompted the authorities to separate the different instruments for implementing economic policy. In this context, monetary policy has been clearly been assigned the objective of maintaining price stability. Today, monetary policies are conducted within a framework characterised by three features: • Firstly, reducing inflation expectations depends on compliance with a number of rules that have been clearly defined in advance. Consequently, this policy can only be effective if the authority responsible for defining and implementing it is credible. The conjunction of a clear, overriding objective of price stability (which has been explicitly laid down in the statute of the ECB), with well-established institutional independence ensures the continuity of the monetary policy decisions made by the authorities. • Secondly, the emergence of a globalised market has quite naturally led to new developments in monetary policy instruments. The interest-rate instrument is overwhelmingly used to the detriment of quantitative and regulatory instruments. • Lastly, these instruments serve converging strategies. The ECB 's monetary policy framework, for instance, is based on an analysis of growth in the monetary aggregate-the EMU reference value for M3 growth is 4.5%--combined with a wide range of economic and financial indicators to monitor inflationary risks. In such a context, monetary policy acts as a stabiliser Monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which inay be jeopardised by shocks from both the financial and the real economies. However, it must be stressed that an adequate monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite to a smooth functioning of the financial cycles. An appropriate monetary stance -both in terms of interest rate and money supply- is crucial for banks and monetary participants to base their decisions on solid ground. The objective of price stability lowers economic agents' uncertainty regarding future price developments. In addition, by committing itself to a long-term objective, the central bank reduces market uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest rates and money supply are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy. However, for financial systems to be stable, monetary policy must be consistent with the other aspects of economic policy, that is, fiscal policy and structural programmes. The policy mix must be well-balanced at the international as well as the domestic levels. Placing too heavy a burden on monetary policy in terms of achieving the main economic and financial balances is detrimental to its effectiveness. In particular, it diminishes its ability to maintain and consolidate financial market stability. This concern underlies the implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact in Economic 6 r C C and Monetary Union. By obliging fiscal policies to commit to stability, the pact allows the fisc~l bu~fers to fulfil their role as stabilisers. Indeed, by their information and e~pect~tions, investors can penalise imbalances affecting the main world economies or diverging developments in different countries. To reduce this constraint economic and monetary policies must be harmonised at the international level in o;der to achieve more balanced international financial relations. B. Financial authorities have to soften as much as possible some of the side-effects of the new financial market features. Let us first consider a few possible improvements as regards credit cycles : • Provisioning standards should allow banks' lending to be less pro-cyclical. As a general rule, provisioning standards require improvements so that provisions better reflect the actual inherent credit risk of loan portfolios. They should also be improved for macroeconomic purposes, so that banks' lending behaviour becomes less pro-cyclical. These objectives could be achieved through a more forward-looking provisioning, whereby provisions are set up earlier - that is to say, in a perfect world, as soon as a loan is granted. Current accounting and tax frameworks hamper the widespread adoption of dynamic provisioning by requiring that risks on specific loans be identified prior to provisioning. Discussions among accounting standard-setters, tax authorities and regulators are essential to encourage such a reform. • Globalisation and the development of financial markets have created a real need for reliable information and harmonised accounting practices. We fully support such trends towards increased transparency. But, it is nonetheless vital to ensure that, when applied to banks, some of the new widespread accounting practices neither distort the presentation of banks' individual situations, nor disrupt their management practices. A ""full fair value"" approach assumes that a ""fair value"" can be determined for all financial instruments; but this does not necessarily apply to banking activities, since loans and deposits are essentially neither liquid nor tractable. Using the f u/1 fair value approach for the banking book might result in sharp swings in banks' earnings and prompt banks to curtail their lending activity. This approach might further amplify the credit cycle and could potentially affect financial stability. This is the reason why an increasing number of bank regulators are not in favour of this approach as regards banking book. Let now focus on asset prices moves. Financial authorities might reflect on some ways to foster behavioural diversity in financial markets. As we have seen before, a series of factors, such as short-termism, mimetic behaviour or index management, have tended to make ""contrarians"" less pro-active on financial markets. This has resulted in somewhat modified market dynamics and less efficient price determination mechanisms. In order to safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, the diversity of participants' behaviours must be _protected or even reinforced. This necessary diversity should logically reflect natural differences 7 in time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore three possible avenues for future action for both authorities and the industry. First avenue: Strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency • Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore continues to be a priority. • One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness. A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouring countries are treated in the same way -regardless of their actual economic and financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. • Transparency as substantially improved since the Asian crisis thanks to a solid global consensus. Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. Second possible avenue : Taking into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants. • Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, this type of investor are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors , who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. • To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures . This objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds and life insurance companies are assessed. In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use. It might imply that some rules and standards would be adapted to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. Third possible avenue : Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions: ¦ As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used by too many participants. To some degree, this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they took inadequate account -8 of market liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis -, such tools might tend to give conve~ging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. • Of course, the fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than th~ average is a guarantee that standardisation .will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. • However , supervisors might help, and obviously are already helping to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing . This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach . These are only examples of possible options to help improve the functioning of the financial cycles and smooth their interaction with the business cycles . There is probably some merit to embark in an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices and of structural developments of markets themselves, to identify possible amendments and improvements that could help, protect and enhance the ""behavorial and conceptual diversity of modern financial markets. 21n conclusion, let me stress the important role played by central banks in preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. ¦ The recent years have shown the benefits of monetary stability in terms of growth in a globalised world. It is of course closely linked to central banks ' independence, which is no longer a matter of debate. ¦ Financial authorities are nevertheless faced with a new challenge , which is to strengthen financial stability, in a context of amplified financial cycles, in conjunction with monetary stability. I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. ¦ Central banks have a undoubtedly special responsibility due to their position at the heart of financial systems: - they contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions gives them a thorou gh understanding of banking systems, - they are responsible for ensuring that payment systems operate smoothly, - and they contribut e to banking supervision.

Les secteurs de !'automobile et des biens de consommation ont toutefois progresse tandis que l 'industrie agroalimentaire se redressait. Le taux d'utilisation des capacites de production, toujours superieur a sa moyenne de longue periode , s'est replie pour revenir a son niveau d'octobre 1999. j La demande globale a peu evolue. A !'exportation, le courant d'ordres en provenance des Etats-Unis et, clans une moindre mesure, de l'Asie s'est affaibli; la demande europeenne, a !'exception de celle de l'Allemagne, demeure soutenue . La demande inteme est moins affectee mais les commandes interindustrielles sont jugees moins vigoureuses en raison, notamment, du repli de certains secteurs comme la telephonie. Les carnets de commandes continuent de se reduire, particulierement dans les biens intermediaires, mais sont toujours juges correctement gamis dans l 'ensemble . Les stocks excedent legerement le niveau desire, sauf clans les industries agroalimentaires ou ils apparaissent bien adaptes. Au cours des prochains mois, l'activite devrait faiblement augmenter dans !'ensemble des secteurs. Les prix des matieres premieres comme ceux des produits finis n'ont guere varie. Les investissements programmes se realisent comme prevu . Toutefois, les responsables d'entreprise tendent plutot a privilegier !'amelioration de la productivite sur !' augmentation des capacites. L'activite commerciale s'est repliee au cours du bimestre ecoule. Elle apparait neanmoins en hausse a un an d'intervalle et la plupart des commeryants demeurent confiants pour les prochains mois. Les effectifs permanents sont restes stables dans tous les secteurs . L'ajustement de l'emploi a l'activite se fait principalement par le recours a !'interim ou des modulations d'horaire prevues dans les accords de reduction du temps de travail. Les difficultes de recrutement de main-d'oeuvre qualifiee perdurent dans certains secteurs. Avertissement: Les commentaires s'appliquent a des donnees corrigees des variations saisonnieres.

I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, within nine months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be - recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st -January 1999. Then, a decisive event in the history of Europe ft occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. C I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. I. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out thatj from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: 2 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 4 • operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking t liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates;. • the security provided by the procedures and systems Implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the transfer of large--value payments in real time throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system now processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1, 1 oo billion euros daily, of which 40% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. b/ 'Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success f has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. ,... I The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in the other co.untrtes. participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. 3 Fa>< re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 P9: 5 Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not i starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, . on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the ,. field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the darity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a man~ate for maintaining price stability. We . have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have-based f our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up. a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad mo.n~ aggregate M3; last December, we have confirmed this ra_te of growth of 4,5 % as an important factor for stabilising expectations. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. 4 -=---·: r Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 6 The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set -of • indicators that are important in our eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears to have been understood. by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has kept intact the legacy of credibility that it has inherited. di Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's _constant e_fforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the • Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference-which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB -website. This will be the case when we will meet next Wednesday in Frankfurt. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 1st January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other t important central banks decided to go along the same path. Being accountable for an independent institution in a modem democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, In a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reast?ni~ that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective. 5 Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 7 duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the i European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so In total in ten languages), through the lens of twelve different cultures, the same message from the Eurosystem. To improve its transparency and its communication even further, the Eurosystem decided to publish for the first time in December 2000 Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. In terms of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to e)(J)lain, justify, • whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions· taken.: I think that . the Eurosystem meets the. best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to i~ pres~m~p c~ntrJq;qtiQr,~ ~nd ~lleijed inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the lack of ~o-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an . ' ' '. ,.. "" ~ppropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy contains some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. What can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very important question? 6 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 8 Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever it takes place, does not necessarily , imply that, at any given point in time, all the particlpati~g countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence proces,. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the earty 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally i rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuelson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in 2000, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USD 437 in Mississippi and USD 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic deveh:;,pments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 r= 06/04/01 09:01 , rn this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policiest while strictly respecting the Independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies •as a matter of common Interest'' and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed , for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States o.f Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy , to counterbalance the facl that Europe does not have a significant federal budget> just as it has no federal government. Close mutual Pg: 9 . - - ; :• surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individua l countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns -which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits . - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed , by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ''close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during r,~ssions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to q.iwe a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to couA~ ~romic divergences or asymmetric shocks . 8 I '£' .. - • • . - . . • 06/04/01 09:01 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a re_sponse to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mu_ndell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: 11 If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than within a long-established -monetary union such as the US. IL THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly. successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro in the medium term. What is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market a/ The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the single market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 Pg: 10 06/04/01 09:01 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be ~ made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. b/ Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 900 billion euros in 2000, it is now ~ catching up on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of the money market The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the sh<?rt-term derivatives market. whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market These structural changes m the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated within the euro area their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition 10 Pg: 11 Fax re~u de 06/04/01 09:01 Pg: 12 in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. • With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on 1he euro-denominated bond market and the equity market.. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro in 1999, against the equivalent of _902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in 1he first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro-area private sector borrowers have issued about ~ three quarters of their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s .. Similarly, private borrowers residing outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. And, according to recent statistics, the euro could have been the first currency for bond issuance before the US dollar during the first quarter of 2001, with 46% of international bond issuance against 44% for US dollar. Furthermore. European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and so forth. Had the euro not been created, would It have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. Tbis figure reflects 11 Fax re9u de : 06/04/01 09:01 the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. There are still some barriers to further Integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal mark~t for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets and welcome the ensuing Regulation recently adopted by the EU Council in Stockholm : we are convinced that the i~plementation of these policy guidelines will contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and to r developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms Pg: 13 - . .. :::_ al The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial -,:; r domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. Two weeks ago, the Stockholm European Council confinned these orientations and even added key issues sue~ a~ ageing in the EU and the role of bfotechnology in the Eur9Pean economic growth. 12 Fax re!;U de 06/04/01 09:01 All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in ' particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been dedining significantly In most of its economies for three years . According to the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations . EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital m~bility and a better functioning single market; firms Yt'ill become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue_ to be put on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets . The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic perfonnance and could react ·-accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly ~ on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy , especially competition, continue to apply to each economy_ Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the_goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of 13 Pg: 14 Fax re-;u de 06/04/01 09:01 these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and ~ regulatory framework. The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a vie~ to ensure ear1y warnings and appropriate reactions . .. . .. Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the pr~sent diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central· ~ankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary , we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is paving the way for medium and for long-term, sustainable robust growth. This is the strong belief of the Europeans. I see th·ree main channels through which price stability is fostering growth. First , preserving and reinforcing the competitiveness of the productive sector through low inflation and therefore low unit production costs. Second, reinforcing the trust of savers.-in that monetary and financial instruments will preserve their value in the medium and long run therefore permitting low medium and long term market interest rates . And, last but not least, fostering growth of domestic demand by preserving the purchasing power of households through low inflation. - This last contribution to growth is particularly important presently in the Eurozone. In reinforcing confidence of the European people in the ability of the Eurosystem to deliver price stability and low inflation we are improving the ~verall confidence of the consumers and therefore the level of consumer demand. Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are calling for · implementing 14 Pg: 15 ,, 06/04/01 09:01 resolutely anti-Malthusian policies in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from th.ese advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to aHow ~ unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which ainJ at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe ~- · from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ·new economy"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic -as possible, in terms of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attibJde in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouragi~ ,to~erm growth. -As regards our present diagnosis on the situation of the Eurozone we are very often asked several questions, in particular : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability ? "" and What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe? "" The best I can do is certainly to refer to the consensus of the Council of Governors of the ECB as summed up by our President Wim Duisenberg . 15 pg: 16 Fax re9u de 06/04/01 09:01 The European Central Bank confirms its position of !Await and see"" with regard to its monetary policy stance. In an environment of Increased uncertainty about the global economy and its impact on the euro area. the Governing Council is carefully assessing whether and to what extent upward risks to price stability will continue to de~line. The ECB has the primary objective of maintaining price stability. Within its forward-looking strategy, the Governing Council had raised central bank interest rates to contain increasing inflation risks and to bring inflation back to levels below 2% over the medium term. This policy has retained credibility as demonstrated by continuing low inflation expectations. It is important for economic growth that the households of • · the euro area can rely on price stability preserving their purchasing power and,  therefore, swpportirig_ solid domestic demand. Information from the first pillar shows that money growth has been on a downward trend since the spring of 2000, indicating that upwards risks to price stability from the monetary side have receded . As for the second pillar, somewhat lower real GDP growth this year will contribute to a reduction in domestic upward price pressures. On the other hand, owing to the risk of second-round effects from past oil price increases, wage developments need to be monitored carefully. Thank you for your attention. 16 Pg: 17 TOTRLT ANT.

"13","discours","15.06.2001","Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France at the European Financial Markets Convention (EFMC 2001) Paris, 15 June 2001 PRESERVING FINANCIAL STABILITY IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALISED WORLD Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this European Financial Markets Convention. The impressively dense program of the Convention illustrates that the integration of financial markets in Europe is a major and multi-dimensional challenge. The Banque de France and the Eurosystem have a strong interest in all these issues. In particular, a safe and efficient functioning of the clearing and settlement systems of the euro area is crucial for the stability and efficiency of the financial system and for the good implementation- of monetary policy. The consolidation of the market infrastructure, currently underway, will contribute to reaching these objectives through the fostering of market liquidity and the reduction of transaction costs. There is however no single path for such a consolidation : it will be up to the market to select the way which best fits its needs, while it will be up to regulators and to the Eurosystem to make sure that the resulting infrastructure is adequately safe, efficient and reliable . I would like now to share with you some views from the broader perspective of financial globalisation. As you know, the globalisation of the world economy and the development of financial markets were driven by two key factors: - firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced in Europe by the setting up of the single market and subsequently of the Economic and Monetary Union- which liberalised capital flows and enhanced competition among financial sectors; - and secondly, technical and financial innovation, which simultaneously paved the way for the creation of financial markets that are deep, liquid and interconnected. What is interesting to stress regarding financial globalisation is that the interaction of free capital movements within interconnected markets, increasing integration of market segments and hedging opportunities provided by new financial instruments have allowed a better fit between the financing capacities and borrowing requirements of governments, households and companies. The use of market interest rates, which represent the markets' consensus on the risk . incurred at a moment, as a driving force is fully beneficial to an efficient allocation of capital. Lowering the barriers to entering the financial sector, the free circulation of information and fiercer competition have also brought financial markets closer to a situation of pure and perfect competition, which is beneficial to all consumers. Last but not least, the growth of market financing has allowed savings to be channelled • directly into investment. Reducing the share of bank financing, and consequently that of money creation, has enabled a less inflationary financing of the economy. Thus increased, monetary stability has produced tangible and positive effects and contributed decisively to a strong and sustainable growth of the world economy. However, while globalisation and financial integration have decisively contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, experience also suggests that financial asset prices have experienced in some circumstances somewhat erratic developments. The rapid emergence of the ""new economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000- followed by a series of sharp corrections- illustrated the potential of markets for providing funding to the real economy, particularly to the most innovative sectors; but it demonstrated again the tendency of markets to over-react, moving from excessive optimism to disproportionate pessimism, with the ensuing negative consequences for the behaviour of firms and households. Thus financial authorities have been confronted with boom-bust episodes which must be carefully monitored, since they could,affect global monetary and financial stability. I would like therefore to consider two issues here: • First, some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder a smooth and efficient functioning of the markets, and • Second, the authorities might reflect on some ways of fostering more diverse behaviour on the markets. • 1. Some factors encouraging excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hinder a smooth and efficient functioning of the markets Even though fixed interest rate markets have a tendency to be somewhat contra-cyclical, financial asset price have tended to fluctuate widely and sometimes deviate from economic fundamentals for long periods of time. 1. 1. Experience suggest that asset price cycles continue to be very substantial • In the last two decades market forces have indeed tended to cause misalignments between equilibrium and actual asset prices. Stock markets in particular have experienced this phenomenon. But in foreign exchange markets as well, prices have also a tendency to diverge substantially from their ""equilibrium level"", although those divergences have been contained through fruitful G7 co-operation during the last .15 years . • In addition, some markets have seen an increase in volatility and frequent volatility peaks. Although cyclical moves should be clearly distinguished from volatility, the latter may in some circumstances exceed what can be considered optimal, making the price determination mechanism less efficient and thus contributing to .misalignments . • Moreover, as demonstrated by a number of financial crises during the last two decades, contagion among countries and across financial markets has been frequent. As a result, investors have faced asset price fluctuations that might be more synchronised than before. • Lastly, the connections between credit, asset price and business cycles have tended to amplify cyclical swings. Credit, in particular, is playing an important role in asset price fluctuations. Observed in particular during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted. Another example is provided by boom-bust cycles in asset prices which have often been associated with sharp economic contractions. 1.2. Several factors are in play when financial asset prices experience amplified moves I shall give a few examples. • Some market participants have become more inclined to engage in ""short-termism"", that is, they nught be too preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield immediate financial results that are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market all assets and liabilities has also contributed to this widespread focus on immediate financial performances. This focus on short-term performance can translate into additional volatility in the price discovery process: the shorter the investment horizon of market participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. • Mimetic behaviour is by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. However, technological developments on markets may have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour. The spread of benchmarking, which allows fund managers and clients to measure performance against that of other funds, together with the growing competition within the sector, appears to have increased such mimetic behaviour. Some operators have come . to the conclusion that it is better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than take the risk of being right, or wrong, alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed, a few years ago; as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. • The spread of certain fund management techniques, in particular index management, which has proven very popular on equity markets, may have contributed to amplifying movements in financial asset prices. This technique endeavours to match as accurately as possible developments in stock market benchmark indices. It therefore mechanistically leads managers to accentuate current price trends by buying stocks that are on the rise and selling those that are falling. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indexes and that, as a result, the indices might end up creating rather than measuring performance. • The impact of risk management techniques on· market dynamics is · particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting. Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standards approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and set up exposure limits . Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments~ But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of homogeneous risk management techniques by financial intermediaries has had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock and the spill-over effect. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, their growing use may have produced some adverse consequences . When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All these factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 2. For this reason, the authorities might reflect on some ways - in conjunction with the financial industry - to foster behavioural diversity in global markets Monetary policy alone cannot guarantee the stability of financial systems, which may be jeopardised by shocks from both the financial and the real economies. However, it must be · stressed that an adequate monetary policy is a fundamental prerequisite to smooth the financial cycles. An appropriate monetary stance is crucial for banks . and monetary participants to base their decisions on solid ground. The objective of price stability lowers economic agents' uncertainty regarding future price developments. In addition, by committing itself to a long-term objective, the central bank reduces market uncertainty, which can be a source of disruption to the financial economy. Interest rates and money supply are less volatile as a result, which is of benefit to the long-term growth of the economy. However important, a sound monetary policy is not enough. To safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, and in particular an efficient pricing mechanism, it is essential to protect, and even reinforce, the diversity of behaviour on the markets. This necessary diversity is merely the echo of the diff ere:rit time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore a few possible avenues for future action. 2.1- Strengthen the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency ¦ Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Strengthening transparency therefore continues to be a priority. ¦ One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness . A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties , all neighbouring countries, or countries that share common characteristics, are treated in the same way - regardless of their actual economic and :financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. Transparency has substantially increased since the Asian crisis, thanks to a solid global consensus. Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. 2.2- Take into account the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants • Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, these types of investors are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors, who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. • To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures . This objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds (including pension funds) and life insurance companies are assessed . In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use . It implies that some rules and standards would be adap~ed to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. I have no answer at this stage. I am only asking the question . 2.3- Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions • As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used by too many participants. To some degree, this is perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they took inadequate account of market liquidity at the time of the 1998 crisis-, such tools tend to give converging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. ¦ The fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average is a guarantee that standardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. In this respect, I must stress that the Basie Committee, as illustrated by the new Capital Accord, is encouraging banks to use more sophisticated and accurate risk measurements techniques. ¦ In addition, supervisors might help -and obviously they are already helping- to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing . This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events . The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach. These are only examples of options to help improve the functioning of markets. There is probably some merit in an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations , as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices, and of structural developments of market themselves, to identify possible amendments and improvements that could help protect and enhance the behavioural and conceptual diversity of modem financial markets. In conclusion, let me stress the important role played by central banks in preserving monetary and financial stability in an increasingly globalised world. • The recent years have shown the benefits of monetary stability in terms of growth in a globalised world. It is of course closely linked to central bank's independence, which is no longer a matter of debate. • Financial authorities are nevertheless faced with a new challenge, which is to strengthen financial stability in a context of amplified financial cycles. I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. • Central banks have a undoubtedly special responsibility due to their position at the heart of financial systems: they contribute directly to supplying liquidity to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions gives them a thorough understanding of banking systems, they contribute to banking supervision, last but not least, central banks are responsible for a safe and efficient functioning of payment systems and, at least for some of them, of securities clearing and settlement systems.

I also thank Arthur Andersen and the Banco Bilbao Viscaya for their contribution to this gathering. It is also a great pleasure to meet again with my colleague Jaime Caruana, between two meetings of the ECB Governing Council. I am particularly happy to express my views on the already successful existence of the euro and Monetary Union, and the conditions and prospects for its further success. As you all know, Within ten months, on 1st January 2002, the euro will become a reality across Europe as euro banknotes and coins are introduced. This will be the largest monetary change over the world has ever seen. However, it should be recalled that for all economic, monetary and institutional purposes, Monetary Union was created on 1st January 1999. Then, a decisive_event in the history of Europe occurred. The euro was born and the irreversible nature of this change has convinced an increasing number of economic players that the success of the euro is necessary for Europe. It is a keystone of the European single market, which will ensure prosperity in Europe for the benefit of the rest of the world. I would like to draw your attention to why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and to the conditions and prospects for building on this success. ,. l. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CREDIBLE MONETARY POLICY AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1. A credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a/ First of all, let me point out that, from a technical and operational point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets has been an indisputable success. In this respect, one has to remember all the doubts voiced three years ago. 2 Fax re9u de rg , -. The decentralised organisation of the Eurosystem ·has achieved the objectives it was assigned in three important respects: - operational efficiency, as is demonstrated by the timely adjustment of banking liquidity and steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented by the Eurosystem, both for the execution of its operations and in the field of large-value payments. At the shortest end of the market, the integration of the interbank market took place in 1999, right from the start of Monetary Union, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the transfer of large-value payments in real -time throughout the euro area and other EU countries. The system now processes over 4 million payments on average each month, representing roughly 1,000 billion euros daily, of which 43% are cross-border payments. These figures show a significant increase in the use of real-time gross settlements in the EU since the introduction of the euro; - the smooth functioning of the entire integrated organisation of the Eurosystem, in which the decision-making centre works in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. The reasons for this achievement lie primarily with the in-depth preparatory work conducted over several years by the central banking community and private financial market operators. 0 bl Second, together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high credibility of the single monetary policy, which is guaranteed, inter alia, by the independence of the European Central Bank and of the national central banks. The Eurosystem has inherited the store of confidence that was built up over several decades by the national central banks in charge of the most reputable currencies. In France for example, the last opinion survey indicated that 80% of French citizens trust the Banque de France. And the level of confidence in Spain towards the Banco 3 Fax re,;u de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 5 de Espana, or in the other countries participating in the euro area towards their respective NCB, is certainly as high. Moreover, and contrary to what is often said, the monetary union of Europe is not starting from scratch. It is worth emphasising that for no fewer than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the currencies which now make up the euro-and represent close to two thirds of the GDP of the euro area-had proven to be remarkably stable, not being subject to any realignment within the E.R.M. This high level of confidence is also supported by the homogeneous functioning of the Eurosystem: the European monetary team, composed of the ECB and the national central banks -of the -now- twelve euro area countries as we have welcome, on the 1st of January 2001, a new member, the Bank of Greece. All the components of the Eurosystem work constantly hand in hand. The Eurosystem is a single monetary team, with the ECB acting as a coach and the NCBs as the players on the field, with a single team spirit and this team spirit is one of the priceless assets of the euro area. c/ Third, the credibility of the Eurosystem rests, fundamentally, on its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. I would like to allay the fears and doubts expressed by some observers as regards the clarity of our monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability. We 0 have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by announcing a clear definition of price stability, featuring a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%. To reach that goal we have based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"". As regards the first ""pillar"" we have set up a quantitative reference value, namely 4.5%, for the growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3; we have recently confirmed this rate of growth of 4,5 % as an important factor for stabilising expectations. It should be noted that the concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to mechanistically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term. However, the reference value for M3 is consistent with, and helps to maintain price stability over the medium term. 0 4 Fax re~u de t'g : b The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is a very comprehensive set of indicators that are important in oLJr eyes in signalling future price developments in the euro area. This strategy, Which ensures a great deal of continuity with the monetary policies of the participating national central banks, appears . to have been understood by financial markets and the public at large. In particular, the yields on long-term bonds denominated in euros indicate clearly that the Eurosystem has kept intact the legacy of credibility that it has inherited. d/ Finally, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant 0 efforts towards transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central banks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference- which starts with a precise exposition of the diagnosis of the Governing Council which is immediately made available in real time on the ECB website. This was the case when we met last Thursday in Frankfurt. It is extremely important to stress that the Eurosystem was the first in the world to introduce, on the 151 January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time transparency in the domain of monetary policy. This illustrates the extent to which some criticisms are profoundly unjust! It is especially noteworthy, in this regard, that O soon after we had embarked upon this new concept of real-time transparency, other important central banks decided to go along the same path. 0 Being accountable for an independent institution In a modern democracy or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle set of democracies like the European Union, means being accountable to public opinion at large. In this respect, the public speeches and testimonies of the President of the ECB for the benefit of both European institutions and public opinion, the public speeches and testimonies of the Governors of the National Central Banks to national institutions and public opinion, are crucial. Explaining tirelessly the reasons and the reasoning 5 Fax re9u de tJ ( I' t)~I' t:J.L .Ltl • O J. C!f • I that underpin the decisions of the Governing Council is a key part of our collective duty. This intertwining of the communication of the European monetary team with the European and national institutions and the full body of the civil societies is currently underestimated. Wim DUISENBERG attends hearings at the European Parliament in Brussels as often as Alan GREENSPAN does on the Hill in Washington. Each national governor explains in his own language (so in total in ten languages), through the lens of twelve different cultures the same message from the Eurosystem. To improve its transparency and its communication even further, the Eurosystem decided to publish for the first time in December 2000 Staff Economic Projections for the euro area. In terms of transparency and accountability-namely the duty to explain, justify, 0 whenever possible convince, and in any case, being fully responsible vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken- I think that the Eurosystem meets the best practices of the main central banks in the world. 1.2. Co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of skeptical people, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro was really to be set up. Many observers pointed to its presumed contradictions and alleged inconsistencies: claiming, for example, that the economic divergences and structural gaps among euro-area countries would be too large to ensure a viable monetary union or that the (j lack of co-ordination between economic policies would deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix, and could not be achieved without a political federation. Other objections raised were the absence of instruments to respond to any asymmetric shocks, and the European economies' lack of flexibility and real mobility in the labour force. The conclusion was that the euro would never exist ! The facts have disproved this conclusion. But the very same arguments are sometimes deployed to suggest that the euro-area economy contains some inconsistencies that could endanger its prosperity. VVhat can we say, from an economic standpoint, on this very important question? 0 6 Fax re9u de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 8 Firstly, that monetary union per se, and wherever takes place, does not necessarily e imply that, at any given point in time, all the participating countries will experience the same rate of inflation or of growth, even though the move to the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us focus, for example, on inflation. Present differentials do not appear to be very large, in comparison with the experience of the United States, a long-established monetary union of comparable size. Data on major cities of the US shows that inflation differentials have been at times very substantial, with divergences of 7 percentage points being recorded in the early 1980s. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of prices gives naturally rise to differences in inflation rates across EMU countries. The convergence of productivity and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence, as a consequence of the commonly known Balassa-Samuefson effect. According to the IMF, this effect is estimated to have contributed 1.5-2.0 percentage points per annum to inflation for EU countries catching up on productivity. 0 0 The recent statistics available for the United States also confirm that wage and salary differentials within the euro area are by no means atypical in a monetary union : for example, in the US the average weekly earnings in the non-durable goods sector stood at USO 546 at the national level, while standing at USO 437 in Mississippi and USO 644 in New Jersey. I am convinced that we can be reasonably confident in the increasing integration of European countries, and in the fact that economic developments are becoming more and more correlated in the area. It has been highlighted, in the academic field, by several empirical investigations that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. Secondly it has often been questioned whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Certainly, for EMU to function well, all Member States must be aware of the spill-over effects of all their national policies, especially their budgetary policies. 7 Fax re9u de 07102/01 10:01 Pg: 9 0 0 0 In this regard, we are in favour of strong co-ordination between economic policies, while respecting the independence of the Eurosystem. This co-ordination is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common interest"" and subjects them to a multilateral procedure. Even more importantly, the euro zone is not devoid of mechanisms conducive to an appropriate policy mix. As a matter of fact, monetary policy alone cannot ensure price stability without the appropriate fiscal discipline at the overall EMU level. Indeed, for my part, I would mention three economic justifications for the Treaty proyisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: - First, by co-ordinating the fiscal policies of the Member States of Monetary Union, the pact ensures a good policy mix within the Euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget, just as it has no federal government. Close mutual surveillance and co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and of the Ecofin Council. Adherence to the medium-term objective of achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" means that individual countries must first rely on themselves to withstand possible economic downturns which affect only their own economy, while ensuring a balanced policy mix throughout the euro zone. - Second, the pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. - And lastly, the stability and growth pact allows us to disprove the assertion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a member economy. Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium tern,, the pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase during recessions without exceeding the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. a Fax reyu de 07/0V01 10:01 Pg: 10 0 To summarise that overall issue, the ""Optimal Currency Area"" theory has frequently been called upon by economists who criticized EMU and expressed concerns about giving up the exchange-rate policy instrument as a response to asymmetric shocks-in particular to asymmetric shocks within a monetary union. I would like to point out, first, that one of the most remarkable effect of the European integration has been the increasing symmetry of shocks. Second, Professor Mundell himself, in support of EMU, made an interesting clarification at the beginning of 1998: in the event of a shift in demand from one member country to another, creating unemployment in the first and inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". In the same vein, other economists suggest that dealing with divergences and asymmetries should not prove much more difficult within the euro area, at least in its major countries, than withfn a long-established monetary union such as the US. 0 0 11. THE EURO AS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro has been broadly successful, one may ask at this point what needs to happen to ensure the success of the euro fn the medium term. What is very encouraging fn this respect is the fact that in a number of areas the euro itself appears to be as a catalyst for these conditions to be met. 11.1. The euro and the single market al The euro is the crowning achievement of the single market. Need we mention the advantages inherent in the sfngle market? It enables the productive sector to make significant economies of scale and allows savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances market visibility and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. But the ultimate objective of the single market could not be achieved while monetary barriers continue to prevent the free flow of goods, services, capital and, in a way, people, by imposing unpredictable and erratic 9 Fax re9U de 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 11 0 exchange-rate movements and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be made with the cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only enterprises but all our citizens to enjoy all the advantages of using the same monetary instrument throughout the European continent, just like Americans do today throughout the territory of the United States. bl Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant change in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M & A market seems to be amongst the most dynamic in the world: with operations totalling over 1,000 billion euros in 1999, it is 0 now catching up _on the American market. The euro has brought about significant changes for participants in financial markets and has fostered structural developments in the financial industry. This is true both on euro-area money markets and on capital markets. - From the beginning of Stage Three of EMU, cross-border transactions in the money market increased so as to represent more than 50% of the total activity in all segments of the money market. The unsecured deposit interbank market-which is mostly concentrated on shorter maturities-exhibits a very high degree of integration. The integration of interest-rate markets within the euro area is a key G achievement which deserves to be underscored. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks fully accepted by all market participants. The diagnosis is the same in the short-term derivatives market, whose integration, standardisation and depth have increased. This is reflected, for instance, in the scale of daily transactions and the huge expansion of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have generated significant moves by market participants, who have concentrated their euro cash management activity and have benefited from better liquidity on the secondary market. Of course, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other ,~ 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 12 0 segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to borrowers and investors alike. - With regard to the capital markets, progress towards integration has been significant, both on the euro-denominated bond market and the equity market. The gross issuance of long-term debt securities denominated in euro amounted to 791 billion euro in 1999, against the equivalent of 902 billion euro for debt securities denominated in US dollars. The pace of euro-denominated issues remained brisk in the first three quarters of 2000 at 498 billion euros. According to the Bank for International Settlements, euro--area private sector borrowers have issued 76% of 0 their debt in euros since 1 January 1999, compared with an average of 50% in the predecessor currencies since during the 1990s. Similarly, private borrowers resident outside the euro area issued more than a fifth of their international debt in euros from the beginning of 1999, roughly a twofold increase over the total share of the legacy currencies before the introduction of the euro. Furthermore, European investors have substantially diversified their bond portfolios since the introduction of the euro, encouraged by the removal of the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve higher rates of return for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionnally, let me recall recent trends towards mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems and clearing houses, and O so forth. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges would merge, creating EURONEXT? It is evident that the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. The total stock market capitalisation of euro-area equity markets stood at more than 5.5 trillion euros at the end of 1999, compared with a market capitalisation of 3.6 trillion euros at the end of 1998. This figure reflects not only the increase in stock prices but also the powerful drive towards securitisation of private companies throughout Europe and, in particular, the take off of the ""new markets"" network. 1~ Jo'ax reyu u""' • 07/02/01 10:01 Pg: 13 0 There are still some barriers to further integrati~n of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council, meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, of accelerating completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan is implemented by 2005. The Eurosystem also fully supports the initial policy conclusions of the Committee of the Wise Men on the integration of the EU securities markets, in the conviction that their implementation would contribute to an improved allocation of capital in the European economy and to developments in securities markets coherent with the needs of the single monetary policy. 11.2. An incentive for further structural reforms a/ The Euro is, per se, also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in all non-financial domains in Europe : a single currency facilitates the full comparison of prices, taxes and earnings. I think that the euro could encourage ""cross-fertilisation"" of best practice through stronger co-ordination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as labour markets, education and training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. It is the reason why the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council made a further contribution to the necessary medium-term strategy for structural reform in the Union. The emphasis put on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States, the fact that the fi) Broad Economic Policy Guidelines will examine the structural issues closely : all these developments are going in the right direction. 0 All European countries must resolutely carry on the structural reforms they have already initiated. It must be acknowledged that a lot has already been done, in particular with implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high, despite the fact that the jobless rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for three years. According ta the IMF and the OECD, around 80% of this unemployment level appears to be structural, that is, generated by our own burdensome rules and regulations. ,2 Fax re'iu de 87/82/01 10:01 Pg : 14 0 EMU certainly stimulates structural reforms in the labour market. With increased capital mobility and a better functioning single market, firms will become more and more sensitive to overall labour cost differentials and business regulations in choosing a particular location in the euro area. They will therefore exert a considerable pressure for appropriate reforms. 0 b/ In addition to structural reforms, a strong emphasis will continue to be put on competitiveness. Pre--euro economic policy meant monitoring the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities thus received constant feedback on key indicate.rs affecting national economic performance and could react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and very reactive. In contrast to the pre-euro period, a loss of competitiveness will not show up quickly on radar screens like foreign exchange markets, interest-rate markets or the external accounts. As a result, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance. The sanctions for economic policy errors could come more slowly and insidiously via rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy, especially competition, continue to apply to each Q economy. Jobs are created by consumers when they choose the goods and services they feel are the best value for money. Businessmen allocate these jobs to various possible locations in various countries according to the relative competitiveness of these locations. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness even more closely than before through indicators such as unit production costs and the tax and regulatory framework. 0 The close multilateral surveillance and the frank discussions provided in the context, inter alia, of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competitiveness trends with a view to ensure early warnings and appropriate reactions. Fax re9u de 07/ 02/01 10 :01 0 Q * Let me address, in conclusion, two questions: the issue of sustainable growth and the present diagnosis of the Eurosystem as regards the balance of risks. - Growth: Central bankers are sometimes portrayed as being excessively cautious and reserved with respect to economic growth. On the contrary, we are very much in favour of growth. First and foremost, because the objective of monetary policy-price stability-is a necessary condition for long-term, robust growth. At the press conference following the ECB Governing Council on 1st February, Wim DUISENBERG said very clearly on behalf of all of us that ''within the euro area, the -maintenance of price stability over the medium term ( ... ) will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy"". Not only are we aiming at sustainable non-inflationary steady growth through our action but also via all our recommendations : we are resolutely anti-Malthusian in all fields of the economy, that is we support innovation, liberalisation and growth incentives. We are anti-Malthusian as regards scientific and technical progress. We feel the new technologies should be approached with an open mind so as to broaden our scope of economic activity and derive the best possible productivity gains from these @ advances, together with the corresponding positive impact on production costs and prices. We are anti-Malthusian as regards labour. It is essential to ease the bottlenecks in all sectors reporting a significant shortage of skilled labour in order to continue to contain production cost increases-and thus ensure price stability-and to allow unfettered growth. In this respect, we all welcomed the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, which aim at boosting the labour force participation rate in Europe from 61 % to 70% and increasing the supply of ""new economy"" skills. This is a very important decision which represents a conceptual turning point. Pg: 15 Fax re~u de We are anti-Malthusian as regards investment. We would like it to be as dynamic as 0 possible, in te1TT1s of both capacity and productivity, in order to loosen production capacity bottlenecks, preserve production costs, which is good for price stability, and allow unfettered growth. More than ever, the time has come to invest in Europe. We are also anti-Malthusian as regards the liberalisation of trade. An open-minded attitude in this respect has the advantage of consolidating and strengthening price stability, increasing the purchasing power of consumers and encouraging long-term growth. -As regards our present diagnosis on the situation of the Eurozone we are very often asked three questions, namely : "" How do you assess the risks to price stability ? "" Q ""What is your judgment on the present conjuncture in Europe? u and finally ""What about the euro on the exchange markets?"". Let me respond as concisely as possible to these three questions. To the first one I will refer to the analysis displayed, in the name of the Governing Council, by Wim Duisenberg :"" after the recent slowdown in monetary growth the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised "". As far as the second question is concerned I can also refer to a joint analysis of the G) Governing Council : "" While downside risks to real GDP growth exist, growth is very likely to continue at a reasonably robust pace."" 0 Finally, as regards exchange rates I will only mention that we are living in a universe of floating exchange system : in such a system exchange rates are not a target but are a pertinent indicator for monetary policy. And I see only one sentence to sum up our position:"" A solid , a strong euro is in the interest of Europe"". Thank you for your attention. ,.r C !J , .1.0 ","jean-claude trichet"

I am particularly pleased to express my views on the euro and its prospects following the launch of the notes and coins, which will be a reality with in 75 days. Before touching upon the subject of this exposition, I would like to make two short comments related to the economic and financial impact of the tragic events _of 11 September in the United States. I would first like to stress the importance of coolheadedness in exceptional circumstances : coolheadedness of the public auhorities, of the institutions, of the national central banks and of the citizens. Being confronted with an exceptional event, the Eurosystem gave an exceptional response. It ensuied a calm and orderly functioning of the financial markets. In addition, on Monday, 17 September, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to lower the ECB key rates by 50 basis points . This decision was taken in concert with the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve System and was fully consistent with the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. This opportune ~nd concerted reaction of central banks, and more genera !!y, of supervisory authorities, occurred in an environment characterised by a remarkable moderation and sense of responsibility on the part of market professionals . It must be recalled that, in the end, the robustness of a system is basically dependant on the quality and dedication of the persons taking part in it. If we keep this in mind, it can be said that the resilience of the interna tional financial system is a very positive sign : it comforts our collective past efforts and constitutes an encouragement to pursue our task. I would now like to explain why the euro and Monetary Union have been successful from the outset, and the conditions and prospects for bui~ding on this achievement. I will then discuss the historical event o'f the introduction of banknotes and coins at the end of this year. THE EURO AND MONETARY UNION ARE BASED ON A CRED IBLE MONETARY POLICY, AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC AND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM IN EUROPE 1.1 The euro is based on a ciedible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) I would like to point out that , from a technical point of view, the launch of the euro on financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indispL1table success, and that the Eurosystem, made up of the ECB and the National Central Banks of the euro area, has fully achieved the objectives assigr ,ed to it in the following areas: - opernticnal efficiency, highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-term interest rates; - the security provided by the procedures and systems implemented , both for the execution of . interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market became integrated in 1999, right from the start of EMU, thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries . .. and, finally, tr.e smooth functioning of the Eurosystem, which is an integrated organisation in which the decision-making centre wor ~s in constant contact with the national central banks on the implementation of operations. b) Together with many other factors, this technical and operational success has contributed to the high level of credibility of the single monetary policy which is based, in particular, on the independence of the European Central r .• . Bank and national central banks, and on the store of confidence inherited from the latter. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, European monetary union did not start from scratch. For no less than 12 years before the launch of the euro, six of the twelve currencies which now make up the euro - and represent almost two thirds of euro-area GDP - had proven remarkably stable , and were not realigned within the ERM. This high degree of confidence also stems from the acknowledged efficiency of the operational set-up of the Eurosystem, which is based on the principle of decentralisation stipulated in the Treaty . The Eurosystem is a team. The European monetary team now comprises the ECB and the national central banks of twelve Member States, following the Bank of Greece's entry on 1 January 2001. All the members of the Eurosystem work in close co-operation . c) The credibility of the Eurosystem lies, fundamentally, in its stabmty-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Maastricht Treaty has given us a mandate for maintaining price stability . We have decided to be as clear and as transparent as possible by providing a clear definition of price stability: that is to say a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) uf the euro aiea of below 2%. The aim of the single monetary policy is to ensure medium-term price stability, therefore creating a favourable monetary and financial enviro nment for economic growth. Price stability offers an anchor for wage negotiators , and is a necessary factor for competitiveness, which is in turn essential for achieving balanced and ther~fpre sustainao !~ economic 9rnwth. d) Lastly, the credibility of the euro also results from the Eurosystem's constant efforts in terms of transparency and communication. I must stress here that the Eurosystem is one of the most transparent central b~nks in the world. Once a month, immediately after the ECB Governing Council m~eting, the President of the ECB holds a press conference which starts with a precise report of the assessment of the Governing Council, and which is made available in real time on the ECB website. The Eurosystem was the first central bank in the world to introduce, on 1January 1999, the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Other major cantral banks have since decided to follow us. Being accountable , for an independent institution in a modern democracy-or, as it is the case for the Eurosystem, in a subtle constellation of democracies like the European Union - means being accountable to public opinion. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the ECB to the attention of the European Institutions and public opinion, as well as those by the ·Governors of National Central Banks to the attention of nat ional Institutions and public opinion, are of vital significance . Indeed, a crucial part of our collective duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arguments that underpin the decisions of the Goveming Council. In December 2000, the Eurosystem decided to release, for the first time, its euro area economic staff projections, with a view to improving transpa r·ency and communication . Thus, from the point of view of the accountability of the central bank in a democratic society - that is to say the duty to explain, justify, convince , The euro area is however a complex financial and economic zone . For this reason, we have adopted a broader-based approach, taking into account all relevant data. We have thus based our monetary policy on two ""pillars"" . In view of the monetary origins of inflation in the medium term, we have assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3, which constitute s· the first ""pillar"" of our monetary policy strategy . This pillar is based on a reference value which we set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggragate M3. This monetary indicator is regarded as being the most compatible with medium-term price stability. Last December, we confirmed this 4.5% growth rate for M3. The concept of a reference value does not imply a commitment on the part of the Eurosystem to automatically correct deviations in monetary growth in the short term . The reference value of M3 is consistent with lasting price stability. Naturally, we also follow the counterparts of M3 closely, that is to say the sources of money creation, and especially lending to the economy and capital flows with the rest of the world. However, trends in monetary aggregates are not in themselves sufficient for assessing the risks to price stability . This is why we need an exhaustive description of the prevailing economic and financial situation. The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is based on a broad range of var iables acting as leading indicators of the outlook for euro area price developments . Our monstary strategy ensures a continuity from the monetary policies previously conducted by the national central banks, which now belong to the Eurosystem. This strategy has been well received by financial markets and the general public . In particular , the relatively low yields on long-term euro-denominated bonds confirm that the Eurosystem has retained the credibility store it inherited . whenever possible, and take full responsibility vis-a-vis public opinion for decisions taken -, the Eurosystem strives to meet the highest standards of the main central banks in the world. 1.2 The euro significantly contributes to growth in Europe by enha ncing the co-ordination of economic policies A few years ago, it was necessary to . convince a great number of sceptics, in Europe as well as in the rest of the world, that the euro would really be launched. Many observeiS believed that the single monetary policy would never come to fruition! Facts have disproved this conclusion. However, other observers still sometimes evoke the supposed fragility of the euro area stemming from the supposed economic and structural divergences between euro area countries. How can we answer this important question? Firstly, monetai'y' union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflati on or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. Let us take inflation for example . Present differentials are not very large, 1n comparison with those of the United States, which is a long-estab lished monetary union of comparable size. In the euro area, long-term convergence to a common level of r ,rices naturally gives rise to different inflation rates across EMU countries . The convergence of productivit y and living standards creates a trend towards price convergence . C My intimate conviction is that we will witness further European integration and, in the medium term, an increasing correlation of economic developments in the araa. Several academic studies show that business cycles are becoming more synchronous across Europe. I know that this issue of cycle synchronicity is all the more important here in the UK, as this is one of the five economic test :; that the Government will have to assess before calling for a referendum on EMU. Secondly, the question has often been raised as to whether EMU can be a success without some form of enhanced political union. Indeed, to achieve this, the COirect mix is required between fiscal, economic and monetary policies . In the European Union , Member States are responsible for conducting economic and fiscal policies. We therefore believe that these policies should be closely co-ordinated . Co-ordination is stressed in the Treaty itself, which requests that Member States treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Naturally , this economic co-ordination can in no way undermine the independence of the ECB and the Eurosystem. Even more importantly, the euro area possesses institutional mechanisms which are conducive to an appropriate policy mix: the Stability and Growth Pact includes, on the part of the Member States, strict fiscal requirements. I will cite three economic justifications for the Treaty provisions that gave rise to the Stability and Growth Pact: . First, by keeping a rein on the fiscal policies of the EMU Member States, the Pact ensures a satisfactory policy mix within the euro area. This is essential for monetary policy, in order to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a federal government and hence no significant ""federal"" budget. Mutual surveillance and close co-ordination of fiscal policies are the responsibility of the ""Eurogroup"" and of the Ecofin Council. Keeping the deficit below 3% of GDP, and achieving budgets that are ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, ensure a balanced policy mix throughout the euro area. - Second, the Pact helps to prevent well-managed economies from hav ing to bear an unjustified risk premium on interest rates, resulting from the poor management of other EMU economies, by setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits. And lastly, the Stabilit)I and Growth Pact disproves the assert ion that the euro area has no automatic stabilisers in the event of asymmetric shocks to a Member State . Indeed, by urging governments to aim at a fiscal posit ion ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to allow budget deficits to increase during periods -of specific national difficulties without exceeding the 3% reference value . In short, it enables countries to create a fiscal buffer during periods of normal economic conditions. This buffer can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks during economic downturns . But of course, the extent to which Governments can let automatic stabilise rs play strictly depends on the initial level of the fiscal balance; obviously countries which still have fiscal deficits have less room than countries with budgets close to balance or in surplus. II. THE EURO ITSELF IS A CATALYST FOR FURTHER PROGRESS While many acknowledge that the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 was broadly successful, one may ask, at this juncture, what the conditions are for the full and ongoing success of the euro in the medium and long term . Nhat is very encouraging in this respect is the fact that, in a number of areas, the euro in itself appears to be a catalyst for meeting thesa conditions. 11.1. The euro deepens and completes the single market a) The euro makes the completion of the single market possible. It enables the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, and all European savings to be allocated to the most efficient investments. It also enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. However, the ultimate objective of the single market could not be fully achieved while monetary barriers continued to prevent the free flow of goods, services and capital by imposing unpredictable and erratic exchange rate movement5 and transaction costs. The last step in this process will be the euro cash changeover at the end of this year; it will enable not only companies -which has been the case since 1 January 1999 - but all our citizens to enjoy all the benefits of using the same monetary instrument throughout Europe, just like Americans do today with the dollar throughout the United States. b) Moreover, the introduction of the euro brings about a significant chau-:ge in the economic and financial environment. The introduction of the euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the euro area. The European M&A market has been in 2000 one of the most dynamic in the world with operations totalling around one trillion euro. The single monetary policy encourages structural changes in the financial sector, in both the euro area money market and longer-term capital markets. This gives euro area investors greater possibilities and improved financing and investment conditions. - From the beginning of . January 1999, cross-border money market transactions increased sharply to almost two-thirds of total activity on all money market segments. The unsecured deposit interbank market -which is mainly concentrated on the shortest maturities-- is highly integrated. The integration of interest rate markets within the euro area is a key achievement which deserves to be underscored. E:ONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the amount of daily transactions and the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. These structural changes in the euro area money market have pmmpted market participants to concentrate their euro cash management activity in order to take advantage of the higher liquidity levels on the secondary market. Needless to say, such integration has to be brought to fruition in the other segments of the money market, i.e. the repo market and the short-term securities market. Further integration will enhance the efficiency of the euro area financial markets and will be beneficial to both borrowers and investors. - As regards stock markets and bond markets, major progress has been made in terms of integration. According to recent statistics, the euro, together with the dollar, appears to have been a major bond issuance currency in the first semester of 2001, with the eurn c1<rcqunting for close to 40% of total issuance. Furthermore, • • I Euri:>pean investors hav~ s~p$t~ntially diversified their bond portiolios . : . : ~ . ,: ; . since the introduction of the euro, prompted by the removal c f the exchange rate risk. This enables them to achieve better performances for a given level of portfolio risk. Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to current trends in mergers or close co-operation between stock exchanges, securities settlement systems , clearing houses, and similar institutions. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable that the Paris, Brussels and Amsteidam exchanges merge to create EURONEXT? Undeniably , the introduction of the euro is fostering very large-scale market restructuring throughout Europe. There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem has welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan may be implemented by 2005 . The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A Lamfalussy on the integration of the European securit ies markets, ratified by the European Council meeting in Stockholm in March 2001: we are ci;>nvinced that the implementation of these broad guide lines will help to improve capital allocation in Europe and foster developme nts on equity markets in line with monetary policy requirements. 11.2. The euro is an incentive foi further structural reforms a) The euro , per se, is also a strong catalyst for structural reforms in a li non-financial domains in Europe: a single currency faci litates the compari son of prices , taxes and earnings. The euro could encourage ""cross fertilisat ion"" of best practices through increased co-ord ination of Member States' structural policies in areas such as the labour market , educat ion and tra ining, job creation incentives, effectiv_e welfare safety nets, etc. For this reason, the ( European Council, meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, ·explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected for reinforced co-ordination . The Lisbon European Council further enhanced the medium--term strategy necessary for structural reform in the Union. The following developments are a step in the rignt direction : the emphasis on deepening the single market, the setting of indicators allowing comparisons of best practices among the Member States , and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines which will examine the structural issues closely. The recent European Council meetings in Stockholm in March 2001 and Gothenb urg in June 2001 confirmed these guidelines and even added a number of important issues such as the consequences of the ageing population in the European Union , the role of biotechnologies in economic growth, and the environment. All European countries must resolutely pursue the reforms they have already initiated . It must be acknowledged that much has already been done , in particular with the implementation of the single market. However, continental Europe is still experiencing levels of unemployment that are too high , despite the fact that the unemployment rate has been declining significantly in most of its economies for the past three years. Accord ing to the IMF, the OECD and central banks, 75% of unemployment is of a structural nature, i:e. generated by an environment which handicaps job creat ion. There is no doubt that EMU stimulates structural reforms on the labour market. With increased capital mobility and the smooth functioning of the single market , firms will become increasingly sensitive to the gE-neral environment in terms of their competitiveness when choosing a pari:icular location in the euro area. The actual process of selecting an investment location within the euro area will be a major incentive for undertaking the necessary reforms. b) Besides structural reforms, a strong emphasis must be placed on competitiveness. Pre-euro economic policy required cijreful monitoring of the balance of payments and the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets. The authorities received constant feedback on key indicators affecting national economic performance and could then react accordingly. These indicators were sensitive, multiple and vary reactive. At present, with the advent of the single currency, economic managers must monitor the relevant competitiveness indicators with even greater vigilance, as economic policy errors could have slower and more insidious repercussions, such as rising unemployment and weak growth. The rules of a market economy continue to apply to all euro area countries. Jobs are created by consumers - totally free to purchase whatever they wish - when they choose the goods and services that they deem to be best value for money. Companies - totally free in their investment choices -locate . their business according to the relative competitiveness of the different possible sites. It is therefore necessary to monitor competitiveness . even more closely than before, in particular unit production costs, and the tax and regulatory framework. The multilateral surveillance carried out in the context of the Eurogroup, will help monitor competition trends in each euro area country and in the zone as a whole and, where necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. I L Ill. A SMOOTH CHANGEOVER TO THE EURO WILL ALSO BE A DETERMINING FACTOR FOR EUROPEANS' CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CURRENCY Of course, the Eurosystem is at the heart of the euro cash changeover process. Our challenge consists in replacing all national monetary units by the euro in all monetary and financial relations of public administrations, banks, enterp rises, businesses and citizens. The first contribution of the Eurosystem is the euro banknote production . Today, more than 11 billion banknotes have been manufactured, out of a total of 14.9 billion. The launch stock is almost ready. The manufacturing process has been carefully monitored, in accordance with state of the art security standards. The new banknotes combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro. Thase security features provide all persons handling cash, especially the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes . Special attention has also been given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted . The Eurosystem also plays a key role in the supplying process of euro banknotes and in the withdrawing process of former national monetary units. At the national level, each central bank of the euro area works in close co-operation with credit institutions, security companies, shopkeepers and ~1olice forces. This fruitful concertation is essential to the success of such a huge operation, on both fields of logistics and security. ( The cashless euro is already in use The final stage of the introduction of the euro will include two changeovers: the changeover to the cashless euro, which concerns all book-entry transactions (cheques, bank accou~ts, bank card payments, transfers, loans , etc.) and the changeover to the cash euro, which concerns banknotes and coins. This summer, banks started to systematically convert bank accounts into euros and provide customers with euro cheque books. In various partici pating countries, including France, all bank accounts will have been converted by the end of October. It is now up to each citizen in the euro area to establish a new scale of values for the currency. In this respect, retailers have a fundamental role to play: their active participation will greatly facilitate the euro changeover as a whole. The cash euro will be in circulation within 75 days As regards the cash euro, the main task now consists in frontloading the banknotes and coins so that, on 1 January 2002, transactions can be carried out smoothly in the best possible security conditions . To achieve this, frontloaded coins are supplied to credit institut ions. Banknotes will be provided to them (as of 1 December in France). Retailers will also be provide d with frontloaded banknotes and coins. Furthermore, in order to familiarise the public and to facilitate the giving of change as of 1 January 2002, individuals wi ll be able to obtain, as of mid-December, packs of coins known as 'euro starte r kits' . As of 1 January 2002, banks will only issue euros, retailers will give change in euro and ATMs will supply euro banknotes . A few days after this date, almost all transactions will be carried out in euro. C Beyond technical aspects, the Eurosystem -and also public authorities- have _an important responsibility of informing the general public on the challenges ahead, the deadlines and the practical aspects of the euro cash changeover . The success of the global process depends heavily on the confidence c-f the general public and cash handlers as well. Preparing people to be well informed and to feel confident in using the euro banknotes and coins is the overall objective of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign conducted by the Eurosystem. This campaign aims to reach the general public through the mass media. It is closely supported by a Europe-wide Partnership Program _me with more thari 2 600 national and international organisations . It has now entered (. into an intensive information phase, since the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features by our President, W. Duisenberg, on 30 th of August. As Mr Duisenberg stressed, this event was more than a mere technical presentation, but took on an historical and symbolic dimension . On 1 January 2002, we will have the honour of witnessing the largest currency changeover that the world has ever experienced . This will be the crowning achievement of a long economic and political process which led to the creation of Monetary Union on 1 January 1999. This unique event in European history will help to ensure lasting prosperity, which is not only in Europe's interest but that of the rest of the world as wel I. * * * Now, speaking here, in London, I cannot help mentioning the question of the entry of Britain into the euro area. I would like to stress the following points: - first of all, we should never forget that the UK is unanimously and warmly welcome in the euro area. It depends only on the decision of the British people and of the British authorities to join in . Everybody on the continent is very warmly hoping for a positive decision by the UK. _ Secondly, I hope- that I have been sufficiently convincing, in this exposition, that the euro is the necessary last major tool for achieving the single market that has been so strongly and so unanimously supported by the UK since its setting up in 1985, 1986. - And, thirdly, let us not forget the figures. Since 1 January 2001, 12 of the 15 members of the European Union have been members of the euro area, i.e. four fifths of the member states. These 12 members represent four fifths of the population of the European Union, that is 304 million out of 378 and four fifths of the consolidated GOP of the European Union. It is already a vsry large area more populated, even without the UK, than the United Sta tes of America. The joining of the UK would considerably enhance for Britain all the economic advantages of participating fully in so vast a single market with a single currency. As regards the present situation I would like to make the following remarks: -first, the main message in the present exceptional .circumstances, is that the first quality of all Institutions, all economic leaders, all enterprises as well as households is to keep one's nerves . The best gift we could give the terrorists would be to change our plans, to cancel endeavours, to delay decisions, to reduce investment or consumption . We, Institutions, enterprises, individua ls had and have projects : let us realize them, in time, and unchanged . -second, let us beware of fashion. It was still fashionable, a year ago, to embark on vibrant eloge of the new economy, to predict the end of the business cycle and to forecast for ever very high level of productivity progress and buoyant economic growth. To-day some kind of herd behaviour drives a lot of obs ervers ancl ·•actors in . the opposite direction : overwhelming pessimism as regards the ( present situation and the economic future. Both attitudes are equally totally inappropriate. It is up to the Central Banks to remain moderate in their judgments, pragmatic and lucid in the various circumstances and to offei an anchor not only for monetary am;I financial stability but also for stability of judgment. -third, fostering confidence is a major contribution of the Eurosystem to the prosperity of the European economy. Confidence is a very precious ingredient in the present European conjuncture : confidence in the euro, in price stability, in its ability to be a highly reliable instrument for savings, in its medium and long term solidity. Confidence of the consumers in price stability underpins growth through dynamic household consumption - which is today a major motor of economic grO,vth. Confidence of the savers underp ins groVv1h through a favourable financial environment. Thank you very much for your attention. l., /I ?_ ","jean-claude trichet"
"16","discours","23.04.2002","Keynote address by Mr. Jean-Claude TRICHET Governor of the Banque de France Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago April23,2002 Asset Price Bubbles and their Implications for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour and pleasure for me to talk today in Chicago at the invitation of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in front of such a distinguished audience on the theme of asset price bubbles. As a central banker, my main focus will be on the implications of asset price developments and bubbles for both monetary policy and financial stability. The far-reaching changes observed over the last decade on financial markets, the growing role of these markets for the financing of the economy, and the evidence gathered over the recent period on the key role that financial factors may play in shaping and amplifying the business cycle, have drawn attention to the relative importance of asset prices and wealth effects on the real economy. There are at least two reasons why asset prices and wealth effects may have grown over the last decade: - first, changes in asset valuations, mainly driven by the rise in the new economy stock prices from the mid-1990s and their subsequent collapse in 2000, have been dramatic. This is well documented for the United States. But, even in Europe, where the influence of the so-called ""new economy"" is more modest, the rise in stock prices has also been significant ; 1 - second, these changes have probably influenced private spending more than past asset prices movements did because of the more widespread share ownership observed in a number of industrialised countries. As far as France is concerned, market capitalisation as a percentage of GDP increased approximately fourfold between 1990 and 2000 (28% to 110.5%) and we have some evidence that the share of Households' equity holdings in financial assets has also risen. All of these developments have recently raised the issue of whether monetary policy should react to financial asset prices, and more generally to asset prices. The motivation is two-fold: not only could the large swings, misalignments or even bubbles, on asset prices endanger price stability, which is the main objective of most central banks, but also they could impinge upon financial stability, which is an other important goal of central banks. Let me now develop these two points. 1 - Implications for monetary policy ~ Transmission channels of monetary policy The role asset prices may play in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is well known theoretically , although quite difficult to characterise empirically. Monetary policy mainly controls the interbank overnight rate, which is not directly relevant for any material economic decision. The way to which monetary policy affects the real economy is when it impacts on relevant financial prices, i.e. when it moves the whole yield curve, or when it affects the exchange rate and other assets prices. 2 (I There might be there several channels through which the policy rate can affect asset prices or asset valuations: - first, changes in interest rate modify people's expectations about future economic growth, and thus their profit expectations; - second, monetary policy decisions may change the set of discount factors economic agents apply to their profit expectations or to the future stream of services or revenues from the asset they hold (housing for instance); - finally, interest rate changes may induce portfolios' shifts amongst assets that may in turn affect their relative prices. Besides this, and for the sake of simplicity, I will call it the ""interest rate channel"", changes in asset prices also generate wealth effects that may have a significant impact on several components of aggregate demand, namely consumption and investment. These wealth effects feed through to the economy via various channels, such as a direct increase in net wealth, which may lead to a rise in consumption because of households' inter-temporal smoothing behaviour; via Tobin's Q, which activates firms' investment; or via an increase in the value of collaterals, which may reduce agents external financing constraints and enhance final spending, in accordance with the ""broad credit channel"". Although the evidence is mixed about the effectiveness of the wealth channel, even in the United States 1, it is likely to have increased over recent years. Moreover, asset prices fluctuations or changes might also activate some confidence or expectations channels that may in turn influence households' or firms' spending decisions. For all of these reasons, asset prices have a particular role in the conduct of monetary policy. 3 How should central banks react? Does this mean that monetary policy should react directly to asset prices? Or, more precisely, should asset prices be directly taken into account by the central bank's reaction function? This issue is still debated amongst researchers and academics; my feeling is that we should remain extremely cautious about it, perhaps because it would be like opening Pandora's Box if we started setting our key policy rates according to asset price changes. Another reason for being extremely cautious is that assessing asset prices' valuations is a very challenging exercise. And what matters is not only the asset price level per se, or the pace of its change, but also its deviation from a highly hypothetical fundamental value, which basically is hard to measure or determine. Although, from time to time, it may seem that asset price dynamics are not really correlated to overall economic development, it is generally hard to assess whether these dynamics are rooted in some deep fundamental changes or whether asset prices evolve according to some ""pathological path"". The recent ""tech-stock bubble"" provides us with an illustration of such a difficulty: while one was witnessing ~ the ""irrational exuberance"" in 1996, the surge in capital spending associated with the development of new technologies resulted in a faster productivity growth, which in turn boosted equity prices. At that time, uncertainties about fundamentals (was there an American miracle?) made difficult a proper assessment of asset valuations, although the large movements in asset prices where a concern for central banks. 1 Cf. Martin LEITAU and Sydney LUDVIGSON (2001): ""Understanding Trend and cycle in asset values : bulls , bears and the wealth effect on consumption "", CEPR discussion paper , n° 3104, December. 4 However, when expectations reverse, for example due to the reassessment of expected profitability in the economy, and consequently asset prices decrease, the point is to determine whether the attitude of the central bank ought to be different in order to preserve monetary and financial stability. That is, some could argue that the central bank's response should be asymmetric. In the booming phase, as long as price stability is not endangered, central banks do not react to the rise in asset prices. Conversely, in the recession phase or when a bubble bursts, central banks could consider reacting if they deem that monetary and financial stability is endangered. What could then restrain them from doing it? Such an asymmetric reaction, all the more if it seems to be systematic, has actually a cost, pointed out in the literature, since it may generate some moral hazard problems: as long as economic agents believe the central bank will ultimately make use of its ""safety net"", there is an incentive to invest on riskier projects in order to magnify expected returns, keeping in mind that potential losses are likely to be limited. Would then, a systematically symmetric reaction by a central bank to asset price changes solve this problem? I would not share that view, because central banks cannot accurately assess the deviation of asset prices from their highly hypothetical fundamental value. To illustrate my point, let us consider a situation in which the central bank fails to diagnose the presence of a bubble, and therefore does not react appropriately to the surge in asset prices, then agents may become involved in riskier projects without having consciously taken the decision to accept greater risk, but on the ground of what they have interpreted as a sound financial and economic environment. As a result, we have shift to another problem, which is close to the idea of ""disaster myopia"" .2 2 J. M GUTIENTAG and R. J HERRING (1986), ""Disaster myopia in International Banking"", Essays in International Finance, 164, Princeton University. 5 The issue of measuring price stability However, this raises another issue, especially in the current context of muted inflationary pressures but ample fluctuations in asset prices: are we measuring inflation accurately? Is price stability being ensured, in the context of large movements in asset prices? Shouldn't asset prices be taken into account when defining price stability? Up to now, this debate has focused on the role asset prices may play as leading indicators of inflation: one rationale behind this thinking may be that asset valuation is computed in a forward looking manner, and ~ therefore asset prices embed expectations about future economic growth and future inflationary pressures. Empirical evidence gathered on such an issue tend to support the idea that some asset prices, housing prices in particular, may actually play such a role. However, this theory has to be qualified by the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, wealth effects are difficult to establish in a definitive manner. This is probably less true for the US, although this is debatable and could be discussed in this conference, but this is more likely to be true for the euro area. Moreover, there might be a danger that asset prices diverge from the CPI, as this was observed over the last few years. There might be an internal conflict here if the objective of ~ price stability is defined by aggregating the changes in the CPI and the changes in asset prices, and this is a crucial issue since the nature of both types of prices is fairly different. So, do asset prices have a key role to play in the conduct of monetary policy? To answer this question, I will briefly describe the way we deal with asset prices in the conduct of the European single monetary policy. As you already know, the ECB's monetary policy strategy is based on a two-pillar approach. This concept of monetary policy was designed to promote the conduct of a sound monetary policy whilst coping with the complexity of the set of major determinants of 6 I, inflation -fully recognized by the Governing Council of the ECB-. That is the reason (t why we rely upon a binocular vision of the factors of inflation, i.e. as a monetary phenomenon according to pillar 1 and as the result of short-term to medium-term developments of inflation according to pillar 2. This framework is also well suited to addressing the asset price bubble issue. In this context, the first pillar is very helpful for analysing how ample liquidity is within the euro area, that is to say how much the broad monetary aggregate (M3) deviates from its reference value, and how economic agents make use of this liquidity: credit and loan developments are carefully monitored, in line with economical and financial developments. Portfolio shifts are also an important part of the monetary analysis. Too rapid a credit expansion to the private sectors associated with large portfolios shifts towards equities and a strong rise in stock or asset prices would, under normal economic conditions, signal the risk of a bubble formation. The second pillar consists of a wide range of economic and financial indicators: stock and bond prices, housing prices, exchange rates are also analysed in depth. Obviously, their assessment is made in the context of maintaining price (.. stability over the medium term, and the ECB does not react to their signals unless price stability is endangered. To recap, if monetary policy does not react directly to asset price developments or to an asset price bubble, it has clearly to take under consideration all the consequences of these developments on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, on economic agents' confidence and expectations, since they may at some point affect price developments. Let me now turn to my second point, that is the implications of asset prices bubbles for financial stability. 7 f. 2- Implications for financial stability Over the last decade, we have experienced several financial crises and contagion episodes: just to name a few episodes, the Mexican crisis in 1994-1995, the Russian-L TCM in 1998, the 'Tech-Bubble"" that ended in 2000, or more recently the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey. However, recent research3 has shown that, if the frequency of financial crisis is not significantly different from what was observed in previous periods over the long run (1883-1998), recent episodes were certainly shorter, but perhaps more severe. Although financial globalisation has brought about improved macro-economic efficiency, via a more efficient allocation of resources and capital, liberalised capital flows, increased competition on financial markets, increased transparency (apart from the recent ENRON episode!), changes in asset prices have also become more pronounced and have experienced clear misalignments or deviations from their ""equilibrium"" levels. Moreover, credit seems to have played a greater role in asset prices fluctuations. Initially observed during the ""speculative bubbles"" of the 1980s and early 1990s, this trend has persisted, if not amplified. Several factors may explain these recent and abnormal patterns in asset prices. I shall give a few examples. - First, ""short-termism"": some market participants may have become more inclined to be mostly preoccupied with their short-term results. This trend might result, in particular, from growing pressure to yield good results immediately. However, these results are not necessarily sustainable. Marking-to-market financial products may also have contributed to this widespread focus on 8 immediate financial performances. This emphasis on short-term performance may result in increased volatility in the price formation process: the shorter the investment horizon of markets participants, the bigger the impact of any new information on prices. - Second, herding or mimetic behaviour: mimetic behaviour is of course by no means a new phenomenon on financial markets. Technological developments on markets may however have gradually reinforced this type of behaviour, as participants are under increasing pressure to follow their peers through matching the performance of a benchmark. There is no doubt that the spread of benchmarking allows fund managers and clients to better assess their performance against that of other funds. But, in a context of growing competition within the sector, it may well have increased mimetic behaviour. Some market participants operators (whose own compensation is closely linked to the relative, rather than absolute, profit and losses they generate) may indeed have come to the conclusion that it would be better to be wrong along with everybody else, rather than running the risk of being right alone. A striking example of rational mimetic behaviour is the influence that hedge funds enjoyed as ""opinion leaders"" and trend makers. By its nature, trend-following amplifies the imbalance that may at some point affect a market, potentially leading to vicious circles of price adjustments and liquidation of positions. Moreover, more and more participants are able to access directly to financial markets, while the expertise to deal with a larger set of technical information is not evenly distributed. This may also reinforce the role of ""gurus"". 3 M . BORDO, B. EICHENGREEN, D. KLINGEBIEL and M. S. MARTINEZ- PERIA : ""Is the Crisis Problem Growing More Severe?"", CEPR, September 2000. 9 ((t, - Third, index management: as a fund management technique, it has proven very popular on equity markets and may have contributed to exacerbating movements in financial asset prices. Because their goal is to mimic the performance of indices, ""passive managers"" try constantly to match the composition of their benchmark. They thus help to amplify market trends, buying more as the market rises and liquidating more as the market drops. It can be argued that index funds distort the price of the targeted indices and that, as a result, the indices end up creating rather than measuring performance. - Last but not least, the impact of risk management techniques on market dynamics is particularly enlightening with regard to the question of asset price overshooting. Value-at-risk calculations have become a crucial element of the standard approach used by market participants to evaluate the risk inherent in their market activities and to set up exposure limits. Of course, central banks and financial institutions should continue to encourage the use of these instruments. But, in times of financial turmoil, the growing use of sophisticated risk management techniques by financial intermediaries might have had the paradoxical effect of amplifying the initial shock, exhausting liquidity and (('4, contributing to contagion phenomena. Regardless of the intrinsic qualities of these risk management tools, we see that their growing use in the same fashion by all market participants may have produced pernicious effects. When market players rely on converging risk evaluations, they tend to take the same decisions at the same time, thus amplifying the initial shock to prices and trading volumes. All those factors have one consequence in common: they encourage homogenous behaviour and reactions to the detriment of the diversity that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of financial markets. 10 So, what are the possible policy implications of these recent patterns or trends Q on financial markets? My opinion is that financial authorities might reflect on some ways to foster behavioral diversity in financial markets. As we have just seen before, some specific factors, such as short-termism, mimetic behaviour etc ... have tended to make ""contrarians"" less pro-active on financial markets. As a consequence, in order to safeguard the smooth functioning of the markets, the diversity of participants' behaviours must be protected or even reinforced. This necessary diversity should logically reflect natural differences in time horizons, strategies and reaction functions of market players. On this point, I would like to explore amongst many others three possible avenues for future action for both monetary or financial authorities and the financial industry. i First avenue: Strengthening the continuing efforts aiming at market transparency Experience shows that uncertainty and incomplete information are determining factors in mimetic behaviour. These shortfalls in market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational to agents, who prefer to follow bigger participants, who are thought to be better informed, rather than develop their own analysis. Therefore, strengthening transparency continues to be the priority. In the same vein, attention should be paid to expand the skills and competencies required by the analysis of a more detailed and complex information. Transparency is useless if only a limited number of experts are able to deal with it. One of the objectives of transparency is to enable better differentiation of borrower creditworthiness. A key feature of mimetic behaviour is that all borrowers are ""tarred with the same brush"". So when one emerging economy encounters difficulties, all neighbouring countries are treated in the same way - regardless of 11 their actual economic and financial situation. The same applies to businesses operating in the same economic sector. Transparency may have improved since the Asian crisis, which may explain why contagion effects are nowadays rather subdued (sees Argentina ... ). Let us continue and reinforce these efforts. Second possible avenue: Taking into accounts the medium and long-term perspective of some market participants Some investors, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have to (~ invest funds in order to enable their customers to build up wealth over the medium and long-term, notably in preparation for retirement. Consequently, these types of investors are supposed to behave differently from traders and short-term investors, who are working on a very different time horizon. But at times it seems that they are all pushed to behave in much the same way, on the basis of a very short-term horizon. To preserve, and even restore, their specific investment approach, these investors might be more shielded from excessive short-term pressures. This ~ objective raises considerable difficulties, because it touches on the way in which the performances of medium and long-term funds and life insurance companies are assessed. In other words, this objective concerns the accounting standards and practices they use. It might imply that some rules and standards would be adapted to the medium and long-term horizon used by these entities. Third possible avenue: Diversify the risk management tools of financial institutions As I mentioned earlier, even the best techniques can have adverse effects when used on a standard basis and by all participants. To some degree, this is 12 perhaps what has happened to value-at-risk based techniques, which have been, ( . for very good reasons, massively adopted by the financial industry. Because they use more or less similar parameters and suffer from the same weaknesses - for example, they did not take market liquidity into account adequately at the time of the 1998 crisis -, such tools might tend to give converging signals to those that use them. They thus encourage the mimetic behaviour that I discussed previously. Of course, the fact that some market participants are more sophisticated than the average is a guarantee that standardisation will remain limited, since they will develop techniques that are little used by others. However, supervisors might help, and obviously are already helping to spread the idea that financial institutions should round out their current range of risk management tools to include extensive use of stress testing. This technique offers a better reflection of the varying situations of institutions and of the diverse perceptions that institutions have of exceptional events. The application of stress testing techniques and their results are thus inherently more diversified than those resulting from methods based on the value-at-risk approach. 3- Conclusion Asset price developments are a serious cause of concern for central banks since they may impinge upon both price and financial stability. And I would like to stress what I feel is the highly complementary nature of price stability and financial stability objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built. However, in my opinion, it is clearly not opportune to introduce asset prices into a monetary policy rule the central bank should commit to or in the central bank's reaction function. Besides the reasons I already mentioned, another issue 13 is: which asset price should we take into account? Should we limit to stock prices, or ( ~ extend the rule to housing prices, exchange rate, the cost of capital and so on? I would also not support the idea of introducing asset prices into the measurement of inflation or the definition of price stability. My first reason is that the nature of goods and services on the one hand, and assets on the other hand, is quite different, and so is the information contained in their prices. Another reason is that asset prices are highly volatile, much more volatile than other prices, especially in the current context of low inflation. Consequently, it might be difficult to implement a sound monetary policy by focusing on highly volatile indicators. Finally, it is highly questionable that one could determine scientifically what an asset price equilibrium value is. Some participants will probably address some of these issues during the conference, which are of great interest for central bankers. I also provided you with some examples of possible options monetary and financial authorities may take to help improve the functioning of the financial cycles. There is a lot of merit in embarking upon an overall review of regulatory, accounting and tax rules and regulations, as well as of codes of good conduct and good practices, and finally of structural developments of markets "" themselves. I am convinced that this review, triggered not only by macro-financial considerations but also by dramatic micro observations, like ENRON, is likely to help identifying possible amendments and improvements that could, protect and enhance not only the integrity but also the behavioural and conceptual diversity which should make an essential characteristic of modern financial markets. I thank you for your attention. 14 ","jean-claude trichet"
"17","discours","14.06.2002","Oesterreichische Nationalbank 30th Economics Conj ere nee 2002 Speech: by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EUROSYSTEM : THE EUROPEAN MONETARY TEAM HOFBURG 14 June, 2002 -1 Ladies and gentlemen. ic is a gre,tt pleasure and an honour tO be with you coday. on che occasion of the 30th Economics Conference 2002 of che Oescerreichische Nationalbank, in front of such u distinauished audience . 0 I would like to present my views on the overall set•up of che Eurosysrem. The Maustricht Treaty clearly defines the institutional and organisational framework of the ESCB and of the Eurosysrem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the twelve National Central Banks of the euro area. I am convinced that such a set-up, which combines both centralised decisions and decentralised implementation, is able to cope successfully with current and future challenges. THE UNIQUE AND ORIGINAL SET-UP OF THE EUROSVSTEM RESULTS IN A CLOSE-KNIT MONET ARV TEAM The unique nature of the Eurosystem in the EU construction · The monetary field falls within the exclusive competence of the Commun tty In the EU construction, the Eurosystem is a unique institutional structure, of a , supranational (in a way : federal) nature. This is in contrast with some other policy areas, which are predominantly ruled by the principle of subsidiarity, whereby the Community rakes action ""only if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better -2 achieved by the Community"". The first basic task of the Eurosystem is, according m the Treaty, ""to define and implement the mone tary policy of the ·~ community"", in order to achieve the primary objective assigned to the Eurosyscem: maintaining price stability. ' (( Subsidiarity with Member States does not apply to the monetary field, which is an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the Communiry. This ensures that: there are neither national nor ""regional"" monetary policies m Monetary Union; - the decisions of the ECB are binding on the entire Monetary Union; - monetary policy decisions are implemented in all Member States participating in Monetary Union according to identical procedures. Moreover, the probability of any inconsistency on exchange rate matters - a subject on which responsibility is shared with the EU Council - is ruled out by several provisions. First, while the ultimare decision to participate in an exchange rate system in relation to non-Community currencies is ro be made by the EU Council, the Treaty points our that the ECB shall be consulted ""in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price stability"". Such a decision can indeed have important implications for monetary policy. Second, the Luxembourg European Council in 1997 stated that the EU Council may formulate general orientations for exchange rate policy ""only in exceptional circumstances"". and thar these general orientations muse always be ""consistent with the primary objective"" of maintaining price srability and respecting the independence of the Euro.system. This reinforces the credibility of the -3 cornmitml!nt to price stability and rules out the likelihood of any inconsistency between exchange rate policy and monetary policy. This unique institutional setting is enhanced by a strong independence coupled with transparency and communication The independence of the European Central Bank and Nacional Central Banks is enshrined in the Treaty . When exercising their powers and carrying om their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or cake instructions from Community instinuions, from any governmenr of a Member State or from any other body. ft Independence means institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider this comprehensive definition as an essenrial contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. -Transparency and communication: political institutions, opinion leaders of all sensitivities, enterprises, unions and public opinion at large must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy : an independent institution is in fact accountable before the public opinion. The ECB was one of the first central bank in the world to introduc~; as of l st January 1999, the concept of a regular, frequent, real-time display of the detailed diagnosis of the Central Bank. Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The independence of a central bank and its accounrability are two sides of the same coin: In chis respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the European Central Bank and by th~ Governors of National Central Banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are significant, and an important part of our colleclive duty consists in tirelessly explaining the reasons and the arauments char underpin the decisions of the Governing Council. 0 4 ---The EMU set-up also provides for a permanent dialogue with the European and national authorities, as well as an operational framework for the co-ordination of economic policies At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as Narional Central Banks do with national instirutions. As the Eurosysrem operaces with a plurality of languages, it is important that its message is conveyed by all the Governors who are the natural contact point of the Eurosysrem for their respective national public opinion, national media and national parliaments. This shared responsibility enables the Eurosystem to deliver a ""single message"" as regards monetary policy and the exchange rate. Turning now to economic policy - that is to say fiscal and strucrural policies -there are sometimes questions on an alleged lack of co-ordination between Member States economic policies, in the absence of a political federation. It is not disputable that for EMU to function well, Member States, especially the major ones in terms of GDP, must be aware of ~e spill-over effects of all their national budgetary policies. The existence of spill•over effects justifies the implementation of close co-ordination between national economic policies. This is contained in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to treat national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subjects them to a multilateral surveillance procedure . Institutions and mechanisms have thus been sec to promote the required level of co-ordimuion. A coherent operational framework has been provided for the co-ordination of economic policies through close mutual surveillance (under the responsibility of rhe ""Euro Group"" and the Ecofin Council) and through the -5 implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact- Moreover, rhe Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, discussed each yeur by rhe Heads of States and Governments. help monitor and guide macroeconomic and structural developmems in the Member Scates. An original framework with centralised decisions and · decentralised implementation Centralisation of the decision within the Eurosystem The Treaty provides for a strong centralisation of the decision-making process within the Eurosystem. This contributes ro strengthen confidence in the institution and credibility in its commitment to price stability_ The Governing Council of the ECB is the supreme decision-making body of the ECB_ Ir consists of the six members of the Executive Board and the 12 governors of the NCBs of the Member Stares which have adopted the euro. According to the Treaty and the Statute of the E;SCB and the ECB, decisions relating to the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem are taken centrally by the Governing Council which adopts the guidelines and takes the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem. In particular, the Governing Council formulates the monetary policy of the euro area and esrab lishes the necessary guidelines for its implementation. The Executive Board of the ECB is primarily the co-ordinating centre at the operational level. In accordance with the guidelines and decisions laid down by the Governing Council. it adopts implementing instructions addressed to the NCBs, which enables the Eurosystem to react and adapr to quickly changing 6 - . 7 conditions in the m d . . oney an capital markets, t() address specific cases and co deal with mutters of urgency. To sum up, with its c.:~nrral co-ordinaring position, the Executive Board, and thus the ECB, is che ""coach"" of the whole Eurosysrem team. The ECB and NCBs co-operate tightly in che decision-making process through the ESCB Committees. Those ESCB Committees are composed of representatives of the Eurosystem central banks and, where appropriate, of other competent bodies, such as national supervisory authorities in the case of the Banking Supervision Committee. Ac the request of both the Governing Council and the Executive Board, they provide expertise in their fields of competence and thus facilitate the preparation of the Governing Council decisions. This whole set-up contribm:es ro credibility and efficiency. In particular, the ultimate authority attributed to the decision-making bodies of the ECB contributes to the existence of a strong ''centre"" and thus to the credibility of the single monetary policy . Decentralisation of the implementation of t_he decisions: decentralisation is both possible and apptopriate In accordance with European tradition, the Eurosystem adheres to the principle of decentralisation, which stipulates that, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, the ECB shall have recourse to the NCBs to carry out operations which form part of the casks of the Eurosyscem. This principle is the organisational reflection, within the Eurosysrem, of the subsidiarity principle which underpins the whole European construction. Given due account of the knowledge and operational experience accumulated by the staff ot"" NCBs in rhe set-up of the Eurosystem, the System actually relies on -7 th~ NCBs fo h · l · r t e imp ememation of moncmry policy, the management of foreign reserves. the collection of sratistic8, the issuance of banknotes, the management of large value payment systems... As integral pans of the Eurosystem, NCBs comply with the internal legal instrumencs adopted by the Governing Council or the Executive Board. They act therefore as operative arms of the Eurosystem, carrying out on a decentralised basis the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the mles established centrally by the Governing Council. The experience accumulated since 1999 has proven that this framework is not only possible, as testified by the current practice, but is also appropriate. - Each National Central Bank remains the natural contact and interlocutor for credit institutions established in its country . They are the access points to central money in euros for national credit institutions, which have their accounts on the books of the NCBs This configuration ensures a level playing field for the different financial markers; . Through the NCBs, the Eurosystem benefits from a direct access to relevant national information. NCBs can also channel the local needs to the European level and they are of course an important channel for communication of the Eurosystem stance to the credit institutions 000 -8 THE COHESIVE ACTION OF EACH COMPONENT OF THE EUROSYSTEM TEAM HAS PRODUCED EFFECTIVE RESULTS AND CONCRETE BENEFITS The mutualised assets of the Eurosystem monetary team Common view and culture within the Governing Council The Governing Council takes the most imponam and strategically significant decisions for the Eurosystem. [ts composition represents a very fruicful ground for· building a common Eurosystem identity and culture. As a matter of fact, it perperuaces a well established tradition of close relationships and co-operation, within che European Monetary Institute (EMI), and even before within the Committee of Governors of the EEC, which was created in 1964 and greatly contributed to building the indispensable common approaches in the run up to Monetary Union. For all decisions relating to the definition and conduct of the single monetary policy, the Governing Council members vote according to the ""one member, one vote"" principle. NCBs' Governors sit in a person.al capacity, that is to say, they C- do not represent particular national interests; they take together che decisions best suited to the overall situation in Monetary Union. The smooth functioning of che Governing Council, inrer alia through its bimonthly meetings, . helped make the multi-cultural dimension of the Eurosystem a strength. In this decision-making body, common views are forged nae only on monetary policy, but also on many other issues of relevance for a cencrul bank or linked to the additional tasks laid down by the Treaty. These 9 9 -common views esrnbl ished within the Council through frequent meetings, ultimately prove very useful for the credibility of the Eurosystem . Close co-operation and team spirit between NCBs and the ECB The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co~operadon, and the team spirit is very strong. The organisation of the European monetary team according IO the principle of decentralisation allows che system to take full advantage of the diversity of its components, by making use of existing knowledge and resources with a view to share competencies and experience and enhance the Eurosystem's identity and corporate culture . The network of the ESCB Committees , which provide assistance to the decision -making bodies of the ECB, plays an imporranc role in forging the co-operation spirit between the central banks of the Eurosysrem. This original institutional feature has greatly contribured ro the progressive constitution of a shared corporate culture. As an example, within the International Relations Committee, issues scheduled for discussion by relevant international and European institutions or fora (L.IIF, 07, G 10, G20, FSF, EFC -, ... ) are prepared with all Eurosystem participants . This allows the full body of the Eurosystem to build its posmons on a comprehensive analysis and ro show a great cohesiveness in international organisations and fora . 10 j The concrete benefits resulting from this original set-up success in terms of credibility and efficiency The Eurosystem has inherited a legacy of credibility and ex.penise from its constitutive NCBs. The introduction of euro banknotes and coins on l January 2002 has been the last step of a now more-than-cwenty-year process of monetary integration. This unique and highly symbolic event for Europe can be considered as an outstanding achievement. The way the cash changeover has been successfully handled, thanks in particular m the efficiency of the monetary team of Europe, had, for sure. a strong positive impact on the image of the Eurosystem as a whole . As regard France, the early changeover of non-cash payments in 2001 , and the rapid introduction of banknotes and coins in euro in early 2002, proved to be a success entirely in line with the scenarios devised by Banque de France in close consultation with all the involved parties (the banking sector , cash-in-transit companies, the Police and the Army, retailers, col!:lpanies and consumers) . It has been the same all over Europe . Toe internationalisation of the euro also illustrates the success of the European monetary team in cenns of credibility. The euro has become a major currency in the world. As an official reserve currency , it is the second most widely used . As a bond issuance currency , according to the most recent statistics from the BIS , the euro has played a substantial role since the end of 1998 and accounted for around 35% of total "" C issuance in 200 l . The share of the euro in international bank assets has also increas~d significancly over the past two years. Furthermore, the euro constitutes a major reference currency for exchange rate regimes adopted by third countries. Over 50 countries in the world, mainly in Europe and Africa, are managing exchange rate arrangements that include a reference to the euro . The intensive trade and financial links with the euro area are the main factors behind this choice. Of course, the adoption of a euro-based exchange rate arrangement by a non EU country is a unilateral decision, and does not involve any commitment from the Eurosystem. The internationalisation of the euro might develop further, thanks to an established track record of the Eurosyscem wirh reference to its primary objective of price scability and continuing integration of financial markets in the euro area. Bur the Eurosystem does not pursue the internationalisation of the euro as an independent policy goal: this implies thar it neither fosters nor hinders this process . A successful technical framework, as highlighted by the smooth functioning of the monetary policy framework and the operational efficiency Prior to the launch of euro banknotes and coins in 2002, the launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has also been an indisputable success from a technical point of view. In this respect, three points are worth mentioning: • rhe monetary policy framework contains a wide set of instruments chosen with a view co ob~erving the principles of market orientation . equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency. The decentralisation of the operations has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth funcrioning of the 12 12 framework. Maintaining u close contact between commercial banks and their national cencral bunks has helped the financi .. tl markets to quickly adopt the harmonised practices relating w open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems. - operational efficiency is highlighted by rhe precise adjusrment of banking liquidity and effective steering of shorHerm interest rates. The Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days after the tragic evems of 11th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly functioning of the European financial markets. - security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of interbank transactions, and vis-a-vis large . value payments. It is reinforced by the decentralised ser•up. In particular, thanks to the sening up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughour che euro area and in other EU countries, the inter-bank _ market became highly integrated. The credibility of the European monetary team and of the single monetary policy, the successful changeover to the euro are major achievements. They certainly demonstrated the efficient funcrioning of EMU and of the European economic and financial institutional framework. Those are strong assets, which will help us to deal with cwo main challenges: financial stability and the accession to the EU of new Member States. 13 13 THE FLEXIBILITY OF ITS SET-UP ALLOWS THE EUROPEAN MONETARY TEAM TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES Financial stability A growing challenge _ _, _ 14 Like every modern and independent central bank, the European monetary team has to fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensuring price stability , a key condition for sustained growth, and secondly, preserving financial stability, a growing challenge in a context of globalisation of the world economy, of amplification of financial cycles, of instant access to information_ I insist on the highly complementary nature of these two objectives: price stability is the bedrock on which financial stability is built Maintaining financial stability might be consid~red as a fairly complex task nowadays. Indeed, globalisation and financial integration have significantly contributed to improving overall economic efficiency, by allowing a more optimal allocation of resources_ However, experience over the last decade suggests that they also have tended !O amplify financial cycles relative to business cycles, which may in some circumstances have led to somewhat erratic developments. I would also I ike to mention the rapid emergence of the anew economy"" bubble in 1999 and early 2000, which was followed by a series of sharp corrections - As a. result, financial authorities, and, among them, cencral banks, have been confronted with boom-bust episodes, which must be carefully monitored, since rhey could affect global monetary and financial stability. 14 ft • .. r The tra0 ic events of 11 s b . . . .::, eptem er and their 1mpnct on che financtal markets hn.ve recently reinforced concerns over financial stability. The fight against the potencial abuse of the financial system for the financing of terrorism has received top priority on international and European agendas. The international community is stepping up its efforts to hunt down money used by organised crime and terrorism. To this end, all players on che financial markets should observe the rules of international legal co-operation. The ade~uacy of the European monetary team's set~up enables it to adapt quickly to current financial trends and to contribute to tackling related challenges I would like co stress here the special responsibilities of central banks as regards financial stability, due to their position at the heart of financial systems: • they contribute directly rn supplying liquidity to the economy, via the banking sector, and might be called upon to play their role of lender of last resort in exceptional circumstances; - because of their close and constant contact with credit institutions, their expertise in banking systems is indisputable: - they contribute to prudential supervision and to the safe and efficient functioning of payment systems, and at least for some of them, to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. The present set-up of the European monetary team is appropriate to tackle the chan o-es tri o-oered by the current financial trends and the introduction of the 0 ~0 15 L euro. Tht!ir key position allows central bank~ to capitalise on the information-reluted synergies between supervisory tasks and core central banking functions. ~ Coupled wich excensive supervisory responsibilities of NCBs in domestic markets, and with reinforced co-operation ac an area.wide level, cheir traditional focus on systemic risk puts them in a strong position co assess the potenrial impact of disrurbances in domestic or international financial markets . . Beyond financial stability, the accession of new Member States to the European Union and to EMU is the last challenge that { would like to mention, but certainly not the least. Accession of new Member States to the EU and EMU Attractiveness of the European framework [ndeed, we are already working in the perspective of enlargement of the European Union and, at a later stage, of the euro area. Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating their accession to the EU. According to the very demanding calendar endorsed by rhe European Council, new accessions to the EU will take place as from l sc of January 2004, that is to say in less than L9 months. This testifies again to the attractiveness of the European Union framework, which has provided us with economic prosperity and political stability for half a century. When we negotiated the Maastricht Treaty, we did not think ar all about enlargement. History has gone very fast. And after 27 members, we may go up further, up to 36 Members or even more. ' .. The accession countries have accomplished remarkable progress in stabilizing and strengthening their economies and insiinuions. Observing their recent 16 ((' hiSt0 ry shows the major improvements those countries have made, in hardly l 0 years, on the road towards convergence with the EU and the euro area. However, we must not forget that the nominal convergence, which is requested in order to adopt the euro, must be sustainable and therefore constirutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-term priority. Indeed, the EU Treaty calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of susrainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic, in the t(_~. interest of both accessing coumries and the euro area. Moreover, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over che past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging restructurations and foreign ownership. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks chat support the banking sector, and an efficient fight against money laundering, are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countr_:ies. Role of the Eurosystem monetary team The Eurosysrem, and notably the Banque de France, is following the enlargement process with a great deal of attention. The European monetary ream monitors che enlargement process, and particularly the following points, which are of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and for accession countries themselves: . Central bank independence is of the essence. As I said earlier, it is an integral pan of the acquis communauraire, which is laid down, not only in 17 nationnl legislation, but ubove o.11 in che Maastricht Treaty. The effective implementation of the act1uis communnucaire is noc only a legal prerequisite for accession to the EU. Jr also implies che effective transformation of accession countries' economic framework, which should facilitate their integration into the EU and, later, the euro area. In this context, ic should be ensured that there is no discrepancy between the central banks' formal status in the legislation and the implemem::uion of that legislation. Independence means insticurional, operational and financial independence. We consider that comprehensive concept as an essential contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. It is of utmost imponance that all present and furore Member States respect this economic and institutional ground rule of the European framework. - I noted that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed, as it facilitates nominal and structural convergence. However, it should be clear that ERM II membership needs neither to happen immediately after EU accession in all cases, nor to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum for ado~tion of tqe euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II would allow countries co retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for increasing convergence with the euro area, for tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road cowards the adoption of the euro, for contributing to macroeconomic and ex.change rate srnbilicy, and for helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixacion of parities; and this, again, in the best interest of candidare countries themselves. 18 r In conclusion, let me make two remarks: • Firsc, the Eurosystem · s track record so for illustrates that the centralised decision~making of the Eurosystem has provided a strong and coherent basis for the exercise of the missions imparted co the European monetary team by the Treaty, both in normal and in exceptional circumsrnnces. Equally, the principle of decentralisation of operations, which is the second principle guiding the ( functioning of the Eurosystem, has also proved efficient. Both principles call for working out, developing and permanently improving a single team spirit, a single corporate culture within the ECB and the NCB 's throughout the full body of rhe Eurosystem. - Second, the currency changeover has proved that the European citizens have confidence in i:he euro, confidence in its capacii:y to be a good store of value, confidence in its medium and long-term solidity, and confidence in the capacity of the European Central Bank and the Eurosyst~m as a whole to deliver price stability. This confidence is a very precious asset:. It is a very important ingredient for fostering growth through consumer confidence and therefore consumer demand which is presently the main driving force behind the European economy.

"18","discours","06.08.2002","Munich Economic Summit Statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France 3j THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND THE EU ENLARGEMENT Munich 8 June 2002 ' ( Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and an honour to be with you today, on the occasion of the Munich Economic Summit in front of such a ' distinguished audience . I would like to present briefly my views on the important and historical challenge of enlargement that the European Union and, at a later stage, the euro area, will have to cope with. Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating accession to the EU. According to the calendar endorsed by the European Council, new accessions will take place as from 1st of January 2004, that is to say in less than 19 months. This testifies again to the attractiveness o_f the European Union framework, which has provided us with economic prosperity and political stability for half a century. The accession countries have accomplished re.markable progress in stabilizing and strengthening their economies and institutions. Observing the accession countries, recent history shows the major improvements those countries have made, in hardly 10 years, on the road towards convergence with the EU. Let's keep in mind, with some humility, the sometimes rather slow pace the current Member States took, regarding for example, trade openness, price liberalisation, or macro economic discipline. Nevertheless, there is also general agreement on the fact that the gap, in terms of average GDP per capita, between the accession countries and the euro area, although diminishing, remains still quite significant. On average, GDP per capita, in terms of purchasing power parity, might be around 44% 2 t --of that of the euro area, while in terms of current exchange rates it is only around 22%. There are large differences between accession countries, since a few of them are not that far from the EU standards. But, more generally speaking, the size of the gap, combined recently with a rather limited growth differential between the two groups of countries, suggests that the process of real convergence will be very gradual and will have to continue much beyond the tentative dates for EU accession. Although differences in income levels are not incompatible with EU and even EMU membership, it is important for accession countries to increase real convergence. Indeed, real convergence is essential to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States, thereby helping to minimize the risk and the effects of asymmetric shocks, in the best interest of accession countries themselves. The Eurosystem and, in particular, Banque de France, follows with a great deal of attention the enlargement process. Within the framework of the Eurosystem, Banque de France contributes to the process through co operation and twinning agreements with some central banks in accession countries, notably with the Bank of Poland, whose President is my colleague Leszek BALCEROWICZ, present here today, and Bank of Romania in particular. * * * 3 Let me stress a few points of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and 1 ( for accession countries themselves, on the road towards achieving catching-up and convergence with the EU. ( , ( , - Firstly, we should never forget that nominal convergence must be sustainable and therefore constitutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-tenn priority. The strict compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be key for joining the euro area, but should not be seen only as an immediate requirement for joining the EU. Indeed, the EU Treaty calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of sustainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. The sustainability of nominal convergence itself presumes that sufficient preliminary progress has been made towards real and structural convergence ( and namely having set a fully-fledged market economy, catching-up in income and productivity levels, as well as economic and social infrastructures, upgrading of the legal system ... ). Conversely, a sustainable catching-up process requires macroeconomic stability. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic. - Secondly, I noted that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed, although it should be clear that ERM II membership needs neither to happen immediately after EU accession in all cases, nor to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum for adoption of the euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II would 4 allow countries to retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for increasing convergence with the euro area, for tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro, for contributing to macroeconomic and exchange rate stability, and for helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixation of parities ; and this, again, in the best interest of candidate countries themselves. - Thirdly, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over the past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging foreign ownership. The latter has also contributed to greater integration into the EU financial system. The intermediation role of the banking sector remains fundamental for the efficient use of capital and sustained growth. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks that support the banking sector, and an efficient fight against money laundering, are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries . - Fourth, central bank independence is of the essence. It is an integral part of the acquis communautaire, which is laid down not only in national legislation but above all in the Maastricht Treaty. The effective implementation of the acquis communautaire is not only a legal prerequisite for accession to the EU. It also implies the effective transformation of accession countries' economic framework, which should facilitate their integration into the EU and, later, the euro area. In this context , it should be ensured that there is no discrepancy between 5 (, the central banks' formal status in the legislation and the implementation of that legislation. The independence of the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty. When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. Independence means institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider that comprehensive concept as an essential contribution to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. It is of utmost importance that all present and future Member States respect this economic and institutional ground rule of the European framework. - Fifth, and it will be my last point, let us not forget the present and future contribution of Central and Eastern European countries to the economic prosperity of Europe at large. It seems that this contribution might be sometimes underestimated . In fact, transition economies, as a whole, are as important as the US in terms of external demand addressed to the euro area: they both enjoy the same share, i.e. 13% of our exports. And, during the last two years, transition economies contributed up to two thirds (namely 2.2% over a total of3.3%) to the overall growth of our total external demand. Central and Eatem Europe countries might represent today only a small fraction of the overall consolidated GDP of Europe. But they represent a major source of potential growth and therefore, in a medium to long term perspective, a very important engine for growth to the benefit not 6 only of their own economies but to the benefit of the European economy as a whole. I thank you for your attention . 7 ","jean-claude trichet"
"19","discours","25.02.2003","FINANCIAL FORUM 2003 The Wall Street Journal Europe The New Economy Forum Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet Governor of the Banque de France THE EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION AND THE EURO Madrid 25 February 2003 -1 Ladi;;;dgentlemen, it is a great pleasure and. an honour to be with you today, on the occasion of the ""Financial Forum 2003"", organised by the New Economy Forum and the Wall Street Journal Europe. I would like to present my views on the successful set-up of the euro, on the economic and financial integration of Europe and on the challenges that the euro-zone will confront going forward. THE EURO: BUil T ON A SUCCESSFUL SET UP Set-up of the Eurosystem The single monetary policy is formulated and implemented within a sound institutional framework, the Eurosystem, comprising the European Central Bank and the twelve national central banks of the euro area. Three principles underpin the Eurosystem : independence, transparency and decentralisation. The independence of both the European Central Bank and national central banks is enshrined in the Treaty. When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties, neither the central banks of the Eurosystem nor any member of its decision making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. Independence refers to institutional, operational and financial independence. We consider that independance as defined above contributes to the clarity and the credibility of the single monetary policy. Transparency and accountability: elected authorities, key economic players, as well as all European citizens must be fully informed on the conduct of the single monetary policy. At the European level, the ECB maintains a permanent dialogue with the European Council and the European Parliament, as do national central banks with national institutions. The ECB is the only central bank in the world to enforce the concept of regular, frequent, real-time communication in the domain of monetary policy. Indeed, once a month, immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council, the President of the ECB holds a press conference. The independence of a central bank and its democratic accountability are two sides of the same coin. In this respect, both public speeches and testimonies by the President of the European Central Bank and by the Governors of national central banks, to the attention of institutions as well as public opinion, are crucial. An important part of our collective duty consists of tirelessly explaining the rationale that underpins the Governing Council's decisions. Lastly, decentralisation: as the subsidiarity principle underlies the whole European construction, decentralisation is a major principle of the architecture of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem is a team whose members work in close co-operation, and the team spirit is really strong and fruitful. Monetary policy decisions are taken, at the centre, by the Governing Council, and are implemented by the national central banks in a closely co-ordinated way. 2 -ECB governance On 3 February 2003, the Governing Council of the ECB unanimously approved a Recommendation for a European Council decision, which is aimed at adjusting the voting modalities in the Governing Council in an enlarged euro area, in accordance with article 10.6 of the Statutes introduced by the Treaty of Nice. This adjustment became necessary so as to maintain the efficiency and timeliness of the Governing Council's decision-making process. The Recommendation has been submitted to the EU Council. We hope that it will eventually be endorsed by the Heads of State and Government after both the European Parliament and the European Commission, which has already delivered its opinion, have been consulted. As soon as the number of members of the Governing Council will reach 22, the total number of voting rights will be limited to 21. The six executive board members will have a permanent voting right and the NCB Governors will share the remaining 15 voting rights which will rotate among them according to pre-established rules. To ensure that all decisions taken by the Governing Council are representative of the euro area economy as a whole, Governors will be allocated to groups which differ with respect to the frequency with which their members will have voting rights. The allocation of Governors to groups will therefore be done in accordance with a ranking of their respective NCB's, reflecting mainly the size of economies and of financial sectors. All in all, this recent recommandation from the Governing Council is testimony to its ability to smoothly adapt its internal governance to the challenges posed by enlargement. Strategy of the single monetary policy The Maastricht Treaty clearly defines the ultimate objective of the single monetary policy, that is to say maintaining price stability. However, for attaining this goal, it is essential to clearly define price stability: we define it as a year-on-year increase in the overall Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (lllCP) of below 2% in the whole euro area. Bearing in mind this objective, our monetary policy strategy is based on two ""pillars"". We have first assigned a key role to the monetary aggregate M3. This ""pillar"" is based on a reference value which is set at 4.5% for the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3. The concept of a reference value does not mean that the Eurosystem is committed to automatically correcting deviations in monetary growth in the short term. Naturally, we also follow the components and counterparts of M3 closely. In this regard, the development of loans to the private sector, as well as the evolution of government finance and capital flows with the rest of the world, deserve a particular attention. 3 -· --·--- ----- - -----However, it is common sense to say that monetary developments do not account for all the risks to price stability. This is why we have defined a second ""pillar"" for our monetary policy strategy, consisting of a broad range of variables that are referred to as indicators for the euro area price outlook. The relatively low yields on long-tenn euro-denominated bonds confinn investors' confidence in the new currency. This was not the case four or five years ago. At that time, financial markets were convinced that the euro would be the weighted arithmetic mean of its legacy currencies and would not inherit the level of confidence and credibility of the strongest of these. The euro has actually been founded on a benchmarking principle, not on a convergence towards an average. This may explain why the interest rates of the euro were the lowest in Europe from the outset. To sum up, we consider the maintenance of price stability over the medium tenn to be the Eurosystem's greatest contribution to fostering an environment which is conducive to sustainable growth and employment. And, it is also its greatest contribution to limiting unnecessary volatility of output and employment in the short run. The success, thus far, of our strategy does not mean that our current monetary policy strategy is engraved in the marble. With the benefit of hindsight, 2003 seems the appropriate point in time to take stock of our experience thus far and to reflect on the various elements of the strategy. This issue is actively dealt with our Eurosystem's staff and we plan to complete this evaluation in the course of the spring and to publish it. Needless to say that the decision to undertake an in-depth assessment of our experience does not necessarily imply that substantial changes are contemplated. Successful technical framework The launch of the euro on the financial markets, on 1 January 1999, has been an indisputable success from a technical point of view. This is a great achievement since many observers doubted of the immediate success of a technical challenge of such a magnitude. Three orientations still shape this success: the monetary policy framework includes a set of instruments chosen with a view to observing the principles of market orientation, equal treatment, simplicity, and transparency. The decentralisation of operations has undoubtedly contributed to the smooth functioning of the framework. Maintaining a close contact between commercial banks and their national central banks has helped financial markets to quickly adopt the hannonised practices relating to open market operations, eligible collateral for credit operations and minimum reserve systems. operational efficiency is highlighted by the precise adjustment of banking liquidity and effective steering of short-tenn interest rates ; the Eurosystem has demonstrated this efficiency, in the days 4 after the tragic events of 11 th September 2001, by acting quickly and by ensuring a smooth and orderly fun t· · f h E fin · c 1onmg o t e uropean ancial markets. Here again, doubts had been previously raised on the ability of the Governing Council to make decisions swiftly. security is provided by the procedures and systems implemented, both for the execution of inter-bank transactions, and vis-a-vis large-value payments. The inter-bank market has become highly integrated thanks to the setting up of the Target system for the real-time transfer of large-value payments throughout the euro area and in other EU countries. Let me tum now to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, which has been the last step of a now more-than-twenty-year process of monetary integration. Euro changeover On 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins were issued and became legal tender in the countries of the euro area. This was a unique and highly symbolic milestone for Europe. Let me first stress that, thanks to national efforts and the co-ordination by the European Commission and the Eurosystem, almost 100 % of cash transactions in the euro area were being carried out in euro only two months after the changeover. Although the practical changeover to the euro might be considered as an outstanding achievement, we should remain vigilant on the following issues: First, price stability. Although some increases in prices of a certain number of consumer goods and services have been reported, the first evidence shows that, overall, the effect of the changeover on price stability has been marginal. But consumers must keep alert, while c?mp'.1°i~s _an? re~ailers remain responsible as regards price setting. In the end, competition should also contribute to lowering the prices in the short-to-medium term. Second, we must closely monitor the risks of counterfeiting of notes and coins : the information campaign of the Eurosystem ""The Euro. Our money"" was aimed at familiarising all the European citizens with their new banknotes and coins (and their security features) and, by doing so, it helped them identify the obviously fake banknotes. All institutions concerned, both national and European, are co-operating closely to prevent and fight counterfeiting. Right now, counterfeit banknotes are scarce and conspicuous. The credibility of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy, and the successful changeover to the euro represent major achievements. They certainly contribute to the efficient functioning of EMU and to European economic and fmancial integration, as I will explain it right now. 5 ••• EMU : A BALANCED CONCEPT FOSTERING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION EMU is an economically sound and well-grounded concept. A few years ago, it was necessary to convince a great number of sceptics that the euro would really be launched. The opinion that the single currency would never exist has of course been disproved by the facts . Nevertheless, objections are still being raised from time to time, on the alleged grounds that the euro area economy comprehends inconsistencies that could endanger and challenge the viability of EMU, all the more so since the European Union is about to welcome new members. Some observers thus claim that the lack of co-ordination between European economic policies, in the absence of a political federation, is likely to deprive the area of an appropriate policy-mix. Others blame the lack of instruments allowing us to tackle asymmetric shocks that may arise, and underline the lack of flexibility or the absence of mobility of the European labour force. Others claim that the presumed economic divergences and structural gaps among euro area countries are too large to ensure a viable monetary union. How do we respond to these important objections? 1) It is not disputable that for EMU to function well, Member States, especially the major ones in terms of GDP, must be aware of the spill-over effects that national economic policies may trigger. The existence of spill-over justifies the implementation of a close co-ordination between national economic policies. This is embodied in the Treaty itself, which obliges Member States to consider national economic policies ""as a matter of common concern"" and subject them to a multilateral procedure. Practically, member States have designed institutions and mechanisms to promote appropriate co-ordination. We can now say that EMU has in tum been beneficial to the European economic and financial integration as a whole. Indeed, a coherent operational framework has been provided for the co-ordination of economic policies through close mutual surveillance (under the responsibility of the ""Euro Group"" and the Ecofin Council) and through the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, discussed each year by the Heads of States and Governments, help monitor macroeconomic and structural developments in the Member States. I would like to briefly recall why the Stability and Growth Pact plays such an important role : - By supervising the fiscal policies of the euro area Member States, the Pact together with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines contributes to ensuring an appropriate policy mix within the euro area. It is 6 essential for conducting a meaningful monetary policy, to counterbalance the fact that Europe does not have a significant federal budget. - By setting up a penalty system for excessive deficits, the Pact also helps prevent well-managed economies from having to bear an unjustified risk premium which would be transferred from poorly managed economies to them through the channel of the single currency. As regards the second common criticism against EMU, that is to say the lack of instruments to respond to asymmetric shocks, I would like to stress that the Stability and Growth Pact helps countering this argument. Indeed, by urging countries to aim at a fiscal position ""close to balance or in surplus"" in the medium term, the Pact enables them to let fiscal deficits increase, if need be, providing that they do not exceed the 3% reference value. In short, it allows them to create a fiscal buffer during normal economic periods, that can be drawn on to counter economic divergences or asymmetric shocks. The last set of criticisms focuses on presumed economic divergences between economies within the euro area. To answer this last objection, I would like to put forward a few ideas: Firstly, monetary union does not necessarily imply that, at any given point in time, all participating countries will have the same rate of inflation or growth, even though the creation of the euro was based on the successful completion of a convergence process. For example, inflation divergences across countries or regions may be accommodated in a monetary union as part of the process of convergence of productivity and living standards. Secondly, I would like to quote Professor Robert Mundell, who made, at the beginning of 1998, an interesting clarification of the Optimal Currency Area theory, and argued that in the event of a shift in demand from one meinber country to another, creating unemployment in the--firsf and· inflationary pressure in the second, flexible exchange rates would not necessarily be able to solve the problem. I quote: ""If the argument for devaluation were valid, it could be applied to every state, province or sub-region in any country, with a proliferation of new currencies, so they could be devalued!"". Even though the EMU relates to a single monetary policy, it also relates to the harmonisation of other markets, i.e. goods and services, as well as financial markets. In these areas, the integration process is well on track. EMU fosters economic and financial integration Financial Europe under construction: the reorganisation of capital markets In 1999, as soon as the euro was launched, one of the expected advantages was the prospect of deeper, larger and more integrated capital markets contributing to reducing the cost of capital for businesses and 7 giving Europeans a greater range of saving options. These expectations have become reality in both the money market and longer-term capital markets. On the euro money market, the unsecured deposit inter-bank market is highly integrated. EONIA and EURIBOR have provided the market with uniform benchmarks that are fully accepted by all market participants. This is reflected, for instance, in the huge development of the euro interest-rate swap market. On the euro bond market, the integration process has registered three main developments: - a rapid internationalisation: The introduction of the single currency has fostered the euro-denominated private bond market, by enlarging the potential pool of investors, notably international investors. - increased competition between issuers, which has encouraged the standardisation of sovereign bonds, the gradual convergence towards ""best practices"", the development of a range of attractive and actively traded benchmark issues (especially for sovereign bonds). Besides, competition has also enhanced liquidity as issuers have increased the average size of outstanding bonds. - the modernisation of market structures: besides the rapid development of electronic trading, the consolidation of Central Securities Depositories is also paving the way for a more efficient functioning of Delivery-versus-Payment procedures, and easier and safer channels of settlement of cross-border securities transactions. This last point is of particular relevance for the Eurosystem, as the smooth functioning of European securities settlement infrastructure is key for the practical implementation of monetary policy. On the equity market, the elimination of the currency risk within the euro area has led investors to shift from a domestic orientation to a more international, sectoral one. The creation of a wide range of pan-European sectoral indices was, thus, a direct consequence of these changes in investor strategies. Additionally, the introduction of euro has been a strong catalyst for mergers and acquisitions in the financial sector. For instance, in this respect, we can stress current trends in mergers or close co-operation between banks, stock exchanges, securities settlement systems, clearing houses. Had the euro not been created, would it have been thinkable for the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris security exchanges to jointly create EURONEXT? The large European goods and services market. Such changes in the European financial landscape have significantly improved the efficiency of capital allocation. The euro contributes to enabling European savers to easily select the most efficient investments. It also helps the productive sector and companies to achieve significant economies of scale, enhances the transparency of the market and boosts competition and innovation to the benefit of consumers. 8 Moreover, the pace of internationalisation of the euro area economy has been further spurred by the euro. Allow me to give just one example: the level of accumulated foreign direct investment abroad by French residents since 1999 amounted to EUR 380 billion (i.e. four times its pre-1999 level). Indeed, capital flows between the Euro area and the rest of the world mirror a high degree of attractiveness: over the years 1999-2001, the Euro area has registered total inward direct investments worth 719.8 billion Euros. At this point, one may wonder which conditions are required to ensure the success of the euro and EMU in the medium term. I believe that we have to tackle three main challenges: structural reforms, financial stability and the accession to the EU of new Member States . CHALLENGES AHEAD Structural reforms ••• The fust challenge is, beyond dispute, to implement structural reforms in the euro area's economies. Structural reforms were crystallised at the European level in what is called the Lisbon strategy. The first objective of this strategy is to substantially raise our potential output growth. The second is to make our economies more competitive. Implementing the reforms: the Lisbon strategy The European Council meeting held in Luxembourg in December 1997 explicitly mentioned structural policies among the items selected to achieve enhanced co-ordination. The Lisbon European Council, held in March 2000, further enhanced the medium-term strategy to introduce structural reforms in the Union. This strategy aims to make the European Union the world's most dynamic knowledge economy by 2010. It has since been amended so as to include social issues (at the Council of Nice in late 2000) and environmental issues (at the Council of Gothenburg in mid 2001). What has been achieved to date in the field of structural reforms is quite encouraging. Noticeable successes have already been registered with regard to policies, such as new rules in telecommunications ' electricity and gas markets. The current 2002 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines evaluation exercise is an opportunity to check on the progress accomplished in reforms that were agreed in Lisbon and recently reasserted in Barcelona. Before reviewing the priority areas where fresh impetus is required, I wish to briefly make two remarks: 9 First, the responsibility for structural reforms in the European Union rests with the individual Member States. Consequently, there is a wide variety of institutional solutions and regulatory arrangements across countries and sectors. I nevertheless consider that such a decentralised approach should be considered as an opportunity, rather than a disadvantage. It encourages ""cross fertilisation"" of best practices through increased co-ordination of Member States' structural policies. My second remark relates to the changeover to the euro. This event has been a major structural reform in itself, i.e. a powerful drive towards restructuring the European economy. An important objective consists in raising the potential output growth of the European economy If France and Europe seek to secure sustainable growth at levels that are as high as possible, the key variable is potential output growth. There are three ways of raising the level of potential output growth: First, to boost investment: the more we invest and the lower inflationary pressures, the stronger potential output growth. For example, a two-point . increase in the productive investment ratio (productive investment/ GDP, 11,4 % during the last five years in France) over the next decade would bring about an average acceleration of more than 0,5 point in potential output growth over the same period. The second way of raising potential output growth is to increase the quantity of actual labour : The European Council of Lisbon set as a central objective the rise of the employment rate of our populations from 60 to 70 % in 10 years. The Council also fixed two sub objectives : to raise the employment rate of women to 60 % and employment rate of older workers (from 55 to 64 years old) to 50 %. As a comparison, the same overall employment rate stands at 75 % in the USA. Although some progress has been achieved in this area, the lack of substantive change and the tendency in some member states to continue to use early retirement schemes remain causes for concern. The third way of raising potential output growth is to promote ways to boost gains in labour productivity: This can be achieved by increasing competition, encouraging enterprise and innovation, and improving the workforce 's skills. Indeed, on the basis of hours worked, productivity in the EU reached in 2001 83% of the level of that in the US, which points some room for improvement. That strategy should be pursued whilst increasing the overall competitiveness of our economies The Euro area displays sound macroeconomic fundamentals and satisfying price competitiveness. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals make the Euro area an attractive place to invest in : no major 10 imbalances may be observed contrary to other major areas. Indeed, the Euro area provides for a low and stable inflation environment, roughly balanced external accounts, abundant private savings, and sound financial systems. Then, in terms of real effective exchange rate, the Euro area has constantly gained in competitiveness over the past few years. In the 3rd quarter of 2002, even though the Euro real exchange rate deflated by unit labour costs in total economy versus the rest of industrialised countries appreciated by 5.4% year-on-year, it is still below its long term average (1987-2001) by 12.3%, according to the European Commission calculations. If I refer more specifically to what has been observed in the past in France, an economic strategy, based on a moderate increase in unit costs of production, gave us an important edge : the considerable improvement in the cost competitiveness of the French industrial sector from the mid-1980s has contributed extensively to boosting growth. The French economy grew faster than major euro area economies from 1997 to 2001 (+ 15,4 % in France compared to + 13,4 % in the euro area), while repeatedly recording a large current account surplus. This improvement in our overall cost-competitive situation has progressively materialised into growth, job creations and solid external accounts. Competitiveness is also linked to European ham1onisation in other fields, for example in the service industries. Most of the barriers to trade in services appear to be due to national regulations and should be abolished or alleviated. While the Eurosystem acts mainly as a stimulus in the process of structural reforms, it also plays a leading role in ensuring financial stability. This brings me to the second challenge that EMU will have to take up. Financial stability Like any independent central bank, the Eurosystem has to fulfil two main functions: firstly, ensuring price stability, which is a key condition for sustained growth, and secondly, preserving financial stability, which bas become a critical challenge in a globalized world economy. I insist on the highly complementary nature of these two objectives, as price stability is the foundation on which financial stability is built. The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability_ . The adequacy of European institutional arrangements for financial stability has been reviewed m depth at the EU level. In two reports, in April 2000 and April 2001, the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) took stock of the supervisory and regulatory mechanisms in the EU and examined the issue of financial crisis management. It concluded that the current arrangements provided a coherent and flexible basis for 11 safeguarding financial stability and recommended a further strengthening of cross-border and cross-sector co-operation. I fully share the assessment put forward in these reports and I would like to stress here the special responsibilities of central banks, due to: their position at the heart of financial systems, their role as liquidity supplier to the economy, their close and constant contact with credit institutions, their contribution to banking supervision and to the safe and efficient functioning of payment systems, and at least for some of them, their contribution to the safe and efficient functioning of securities clearing and settlement systems. To sum up, an institutional framework in which the Eurosystem's responsibilities for monetary policy in the euro area are coupled with extensive supervisory responsibilities of NCBs in domestic markets, and with reinforced co-operation at an area-wide level, seems appropriate to tackle the changes triggered by the current financial trends and the introduction of the euro. Two points of particular relevance for the financial regulatory framework Let me conclude on this important topic by stressing two points of particular relevance for the European financial regulatory framework: There are still some barriers to further integration of EU capital markets. In this regard, the Eurosystem welcomed the objective of the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, and to set a tight timetable so that the Financial Services Action Plan can be implemented by 2005. This Plan is regularly reviewed by European authorities, and progress is being made. The Eurosystem also supports the strategic conclusions of the Committee chaired by A. Lamfalussy · on the integration of the European securities markets; ratified lW the European Coiuicil meeting in Stockholm in 2001 and approved by the European Parliament in early 2002. We are convinced that the implementation of these broad guidelines and the new cooperation structures at the European level will help make it possible to take full advantage of the introduction of the euro. In the field of financial regulation and supervision, ECO FIN Council ( December the 3rd 2002) approved a report by the Economic and Financial Committee which made proposals concerning the cooperation structures at the European level for financial regulation and supervision. These new arrangements are now being implemented. In this regard, one of the statutory tasks of the Eurosystem is according to the Treaty, to contribute to the smooth conduct of prudential supervision policies and ' the stability of the financial system. I am therefore convinced that the involvement of central banks in this issue will remain absolutely crucial. 12 Finally, since the tragic events of 11 September and their impact on financial stability, concerns over the potential abuse of the financial system for the financing of terrorism have received top priority in international and European regulatory discussions. The international community and, within it, the financial community, should step up its efforts to hunt down money used by organised crime and terrorism. We shall not be successful overnight, but, today, there is a strong political determination on the part of the international community to co-operate on this issue. As far as the fight against organised crime and terrorism is concerned, we can no longer accept that certain players are not prepared to observe the rules of international legal co-operation. Beyond structural reforms and financial stability, the accession of new Member States to the European Union and to EMU is the third challenge that I have identified. The last challenge but not the least. Accession of new Member States to the EU and EMU Twelve countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are currently negotiating accession to the EU, of which ten, according to the calendar endorsed by the European Council, will join the E.U. as early as the 1st of January 2004. This provides further evidence of the attractiveness of the European framework, which has provided us with both political stability and economic progress for half a century. The accession countries have accomplished significant progress in stabilising and strengthening their economies and institutions. Observing the accession countries since the beginning of the nineties, we see the major improvements that these countries have made on the road towards convergence with the EU. Nevertheless, there is also general agreement on the fact that the gap in terms of average GDP per capita between the accession countries and the euro area, although diminishing, still remains quite significant. . . - ~-· . -On average, GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity is around 44% of that of the euro area, while in terms of current exchange rates it is only around 22%. The size of the gap, combined with the limited growth differentials between the two groups of countries, suggests that the process of real convergence will be very gradual. Indeed, real convergence is essential to create economic cohesion within EMU and promote integration between Members States, thereby helping to minimise the risk and the effects of asymetric shocks. The Eurosystem, and notably the Banque de France, is following the enlargement process with a great deal of attention. Let me stress a few points of particular relevance for the Eurosystem and for accession countries themselves, on the road towards catching up with the EU and achieving convergence. - Firstly, nominal convergence, which is requested in order to adopt the euro, must be sustainable and therefore constitutes a medium-term objective, rather than a short-term priority. Indeed, the EU Treaty 13 calls, as a prerequisite for adopting the euro, for a high degree of sustainable convergence in the fields of price stability, government fiscal position, stability of the exchange rate, and long-term interest-rate levels. Therefore, nominal and real convergence should be pursued in parallel, and are not antagonistic, in the interest of both accessing countries and the euro area. Secondly, I note that many accession countries have already expressed their intention to join ERM II as soon as possible after EU entry. This intention is to be welcomed. However, it should be clear that the ERM II is not expected to be adopted by new members immediately after EU accession, nor is intended to be limited to only two years, which is the minimum period of time prior to adopting the euro. It would be misleading to consider ERM II as a mere ""waiting room"" before euro. On the very contrary, ERM II is to be considered as a ""training room"". This mechanism will allow countries to retain some limited exchange rate flexibility during the catching-up process. ERM II membership also offers a meaningful, flexible but credible framework for : increasing convergence with the euro area, tackling the challenges faced by accession countries on the road towards the adoption of the euro, contributing to macroeconomic and exchange rate stability, helping determine the appropriate level for the eventual irrevocable fixation of parities. This is to be accomplished in the best interest of the candidate countries themselves. Thirdly, a sound and efficient banking and financial system is key. Significant progress has been made over the past few years in rehabilitating the banking sector and encouraging structural reforms and foreign ownership. Progress in corporate governance, the enhancement of the legal and supervisory frameworks that support the banking secto'r are also crucial. They are conducive to achieving the macroeconomic objectives of the accession countries . ••• To conclude, let me stress two words: rapidity and stability. Rapidity is a key word. We have not much time to meditate, decide, implement. The structural reforms, that we are badly in need of, must be implemented as rapidly as possible if Europe is to be up to its historical challenges. The Chinese say ""It is later than you think"" has never been so true. In any case, history itself does not wait for us. And when I look back, over the last twenty years, it seems to me that an unfortunately well-founded criticism could be that we have constantly under-assessed the rapidity of the stream of history: the rapidity of the deterioration of the situation in the USSR, the rapidity of the collapse 14 itself, the rapidity of the enlargement process, the depth, the strength and intensity of the ""desire of Europe"", which is spreading over in the countries in transition. Second word: stability. Economic and financial stability, in a period of excessive volatility and of wide boom-bust episode, financial and real stability appear to be a very precious asset. We have built a new world: technology has permitted instantaneous communication and incredibly powerful real-time computation. Globalization has created new cultural, conceptual, commercial and financial links between all economies including previously centrally planned systems; together technology and globalization are progressively driving us to a unified planet of universal rules and regulations, code of conduct and practices, market procedures and market instruments, accounting standards, etc. In this new world, phenomena which had traditionally a local or a national impact may be amplified and become dangerous at the global level: amplification of financial cycles, herd behaviour, global contagion. Analysing the opportunities and the risks, and understanding the functioning of our system with a view to making it as stable as possible is a very exciting, ambitious and urgent task. I thank you for your attention. 15 ","jean-claude trichet"

LES FONDEMENTS SOLIDES DE L'EURO 1.1.1- CLARTE ET CREDIBILITE DE LA STRATEGIE DE LA POLITIQUE MONETAIRE UNIQUE Le Traite de Maastricht definit clairement l'objectif final de la politique monetaire unique, a savoir le maintien de la stabilite des prix. A cet effet, il est essentiel d'avoir une definition claire de la stabilite des prix. Celle-ci a ete definie par l'Eurosysteme comme une progression sur un an de l'indice des prix a la consommation harmonise (IPCH) dans la zone euro inferieure a 2 %. Le maintien de la stabilite des prix a moyen terme constitue le principal apport de l 'Eurosysteme pour favoriser un environnement propice a une croissance sou tenable et a l' emploi sur le long terme. Il est egalement la meilleure contribution que puisse apporter la politique monetaire afin de limiter d'inutiles fluctuations de la production et de l'emploi acourt terme. Pour atteindre cet objectif, notre strategie de politique monetaire est fondee sur deux « piliers » :- le premier « pilier » est fonde sur une valeur de reference fixee a 4,5 % pour lacroissance annuelle de l'agregat monetaire large M3 - naturellement, nous -2-suivons attentivement les composantes et les contreparties de M3, telles que !'evolution des prets au secteur prive, !'evolution des finances publiques et des mouvements de capitaux avec le reste du monde ; - le second « pilier » se fonde sur une large gamme de variables utilisees commeindicateurs des perspectives d'evolution des prix dans la zone euro.Le succes de notre strategie enregistre jusqu'a present ne signifie pas pour autant que notre politique monetaire actuelle est gravee dans le marbre. Avec le recul dont nous disposons maintenant, l'annee 2003 semble le moment approprie pour dresser le bilan de notre experience et l 'integrer aux differents elements de notre strategie. Cette question fait actuellement l'objet d'etudes approfondies au sein de l'Eurosysteme. Nous avons !'intention d'achever cette evaluation au cours du printemps et de publier ses conclusions. 11 va sans dire que la decision de dresser un bilan approfondi de notre experience ne signifie pas necessairement que des changements substantiels soient envisages. 1.1.2- EFFICIENCE DU CADRE INSTITUTIONNEL ET TECHNIQUE DE LA POLITIQUE MONETAIRE I.1.2.1- L'Eurosysteme constitue un cadre institutionnel solide, comprenant laBCE et les 12 banques centrales des pays membres de la zone euro. Ainsi queles enquetes d 'opinion le montrent, il beneficie du capital de confiance dontdisposent les banques centrales nationales elles-memes.L'Eurosysteme s'articule autour de trois principes: independance, transparence et decentralisation. - 3 -L'independance de la Banque centrale europeenne et des banques centrales nationales est garantie par le Traite. Dans l'exercice de leurs pouvoirs et l' accomplissement de leurs missions, ni les banques centrales de lEurosysteme, ni un membre quelconque de ses organes de decision ne doivent solliciter ou accepter des instructions des institutions communautaires, d'un gouvemement d'un Etat membre ou de tout autre organisme. Le concept d'independance recouvre l'independance institutionnelle, operationnelle et financiere. Nous considerons que ce concept d'independance contribue de fa<U+FFFD>on decisive a la clarte et la credibilite de la politique monetaire unique. Transparence et responsabilite : Les elus, les principaux acteurs economiques ainsi que tous les citoyens europeens doivent etre pleinement informes de la conduite de la politique monetaire unique. Au niveau europeen, la BCE entretient un dialogue permanent avec le Conseil europeen et le Parlement europeen, comme le font les banques centrales nationales avec les institutions de leur pays. La BCE est la seule banque centrale au monde a appliquer le principe d'une communication reguliere, frequente et en temps reel dans le domaine de la politique monetaire. En effet, une fois par mois, a l'issue de la reunion du Conseil des gouvemeurs, le president de la BCE tient une conference de presse qu'il commence par une declarati_on introductive.La responsabilite est la necessaire contrepartie de l'independance d'une banque centrale. A cet egard, les allocutions publiques et les auditions du President de la Banque centrale europeenne et des gouverneurs des banques centrales nationales, a !'intention des institutions et de !'opinion publique, sont essentielles. En effet, notre mission collective consiste en grande partie a expliquer sans relache les raisons et arguments qui sous-tendent les decisions du Conseil des gouverneurs. - 4 -Enfin, la decentralisation : le principe de subsidiarite constitue l'assise de toute la construction europeenne; la decentralisation est done un element majeur de !'architecture de l'Eurosysteme. L'Eurosysteme est une equipe dont les membres travaillent en etroite cooperation dans un esprit constructif. Les decisions de politique monetaire sont prises, au niveau central, par le Conseil des gouverneurs et mises en reuvre par les banques centrales nationales de maniere etroitement coordonnee. Les modalites de vote au sein du Conseil des Gouverneurs doivent, vous le savez, etre adaptees a l'elargissement de l'UEM. Le 3 fevrier 2003, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a approuve a l'unanimite une Recommandation du Conseil visant a adapter les modalites de vote au sein du Conseil des gouverneurs a une zone euro elargie, conformement a !'article 10.6 des Statuts introduit par le traite de Nice. Cette decision etait necessaire pour maintenir la capacite du Conseil des gouverneurs a prendre des decisions de maniere efficace et rapide dans un Eurosysteme elargi. La recommandation de la BCE a ete soumise au Conseil de 1 'UE. La Commission europeenne et le Parlement europeen ont recemment rendu publics leurs avis. Nous esperons que Ia proposition du Conseil des gouverneurs sera prochaineinent approuvee par les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement. Cette proposition prevoit que le nombre total de droits de vote au sem du Conseil des gouverneurs sera plafonne a 21, quel que soit le nombre de pays participant a l'Union monetaire. Les six membres du directoire disposeront d'un droit de vote permanent et Jes gouverneurs des BCN se partageront les quinze droits de vote restants qui feront l'objet d'une rotation selon des regles preetablies. Afin de veiller a ce que toute decision prise par le Conseil des gouverneurs soit representative de I' economie de la zone euro dans son ensemble, les gouverneurs seront repartis en groupes caracterises par des - 5 -frequences de vote differentes. La repartition des gouverneurs en groupes sera realisee selon un classement des BCN concernees, refletant principalement !'importance relative des economies et de leurs secteurs financiers. Cette recommandation recente du Conseil des gouvemeurs temoigne de sa capacite a adapter en douceur sa gouvernance interne aux defis poses par I' elargissement. 1.1.2.2- Un cadre technique efficient L'introduction de l'euro sur les marches de capitaux, le l er janvier 1999, a ete un succes indiscutable. 11_ s'agit d'une realisation remarquable dans la mesure ou de nombreux observateurs doutaient du succes immediat d'un defi technique de . cette ampleur. A cet egard, trois orientations ont determine cette reussite - le cadre de la politique monetaire recouvre toute une palette d'instrumentsdont le choix repond a un souci de respect des principes de marche, d 'egalite detraitement, de simplicite et de transparence. La decentralisation de !'executiondes operations de politique monetaire a sans nul doute contribue au bonfonctionnement de ce cadre. Le maintien de contacts etroits entre les banquescommerciales et leurs banques centrales nationales respectives a permis auxmarches de capitaux d'adopter rapidement des pratiques harmonisees s'agissantdes operations d'open market, des garanties eligibles aux operations derefinancement et du mecanisme de reserves obligatoires.- l'efficacite operationnelle est illustree par la precision de l'ajustement de Ialiquidite bancaire et l'efficacite du pilotage des taux d'interet a court terme;l'Eurosysteme a constamment demontre son efficacite en la matiere tout au longdes quatre dernieres annees, et en particulier durant les jours qui ont suivi lesevenements tragiques du 11 septembre 2001, en agissant rapidement et enveillant a garantir le bon fonctionnement des marches de capitaux europeens.- 6 -- la securite est assuree par les procedures et systemes mis en reuvre tant pourI' execution des operations interbancaires que pour les paiements de grosmontant. L'integration du marche interbancaire s'est operee grace a la mise enplace du systeme Target pour le transfert, en temps reel, des paiements demontant eleve dans !'ensemble de la zone euro et dans les autres pays de !'Unioneuropeenne.1.1.3- L'UEM FAVORISE L'INTEGRATION ECONOMIQUE ET FINANCIERE 1.1.3.1- Integration effective des marches de capitaux europeens En 1999, l'un des avantages attendus de !'introduction de l'euro residait dans la perspective d'un approfondissement, d'un elargissement et d'une plus grande integration des marches de capitaux, evolutions de nature a reduire le cofit du capital pour les entreprises et a offrir aux epargnants europeens une palette accrue d'options susceptibles d'etre utilisees pour leurs placements. Ces perspectives sont desormais reelles, tant sur le marche monetaire que sur les autres compartiments des marches de capitaux. Sur le marche monetaire de l'euro, !'integration du marche interbancaire des depots en blanc est tres elevee. L 'Eonia et l'Euribor constituent des taux de reference unanimement reconnus par l 'ensemble des operateurs, comme l 'atteste la tres forte progression du marche des swaps de taux d'interet en euros. - 7 -Sur le marche obligataire de I' euro, la concurrence entre emetteurs a ete renforcee, ce qui a favorise I 'harmonisation des differents compartiments de titres souverains, la convergence progressive vers les « meilleures pratiques » et le developpement de plusieurs emprunts de reference attractifs et activement negocies (titres souverains notamment). En outre, la concurrence a pernus d'ameliorer la liquidite, les emetteurs ayant accru le montant moyen de leur encours. La modernisation des structures de marche a ete poursmv1e : outre le developpement du courtage electronique ( e-trading), le mouvement de concentration observe chez les depositaires centraux de titres favorise un fonctionnement plus efficient des procedures de reglement-Iivraison ainsi que la mise en reuvre de modalites de reglement plus simples et plus sores des operations transfrontiere sur titres. Ce demier point est particulierement important pour l 'Eurosysteme, le bon fonctionnement de I 'infrastructure de reglement des titres etant essentiel a la mise en reuvre de la politique monetaire. Sur le marche des actions, les marches raisonnent dorenavant au mveau europeen. L'elimination du risque de change entre les differents pays de la zone euro a en effet amene les investisseurs a renforcer la composante internationale et sectorielle dans leurs choix de portefeuille et a ne plus se limiter a une optique nationale. La creation d'une large gamme d'indices sectoriels paneuropeens a ete une consequence directe de ces modifications de la strategie des investisseurs. - 8 -I.1.3.2- Concentration du secteur financier:En outre, l'euro a constitue un important element catalyseur de l'activite de fusion et acquisition dans le secteur financier. A cet egard, il convient de souligner la vague de fusions ou d'alliances intervenant actuellement au sein des banques, bourses de valeurs, systemes de reglement de titres et chambres de compensation. Si l'euro n'avait pas ete cree, aurait-on pu envisagerEuronext, resultat de la fusion entre les Bourses d 'Amsterdam, de Bruxelles, de Lisbonne et de Paris? 1.2. LE ROLE INTERNATIONAL DE L'EURO, UN DEVELOPPEMENT INCONTESTABLE MAIS PROGRESSIF Tout d'abord, il faut souligner que le role international de l'euro n'est pas un objectif en soi pour l'Eurosysteme. Ce dernier observe une position de neutralite face a son developpement, c'est-a-dire qu'il ne l'empeche ni ne !'encourage. Le developpement du role international de l'euro est un processus de long terme, qui implique une modification en profondeur du comportement des agents. Cependant, on enregistre d'ores et deja quelques evolutions significatives. I.2.1- LE DEVELOPPEMENT DE L'UTILISATION INTERNATIONALE PRIVEEDEL'EURO L'euro est tout d'abord utilise au plan international comme instrument financier. Son utilisation com.me monnaie de financement a connu une evolution marquee. II constitue ainsi la seconde monnaie d'emission de titres sur le marche international. La part de l'euro dans les emissions de titres sur le marche - 9 -international ( definition large) atteignait 39 % au second trimestre 2002 ( contre 45 % pour le dollar US et 6 % pour le yen), en augmentation de 11 points de pourcentage par rapport a la part totale des anciennes monnaies nationales plus l'ecu a la fin de 1998 (statistiques BRI et Rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). L'utilisation de l'euro comme monnaie de placement s'est accrue egalement de fagon notable. La part de l'euro dans les actifs bancaires internationaux se montait a 24 % a la fin du ler trimestre 2002 (contre 52 % pour le dollar et 11 % pour le yen), soit une augmentation de 6 points de pourcentage par rapport a la date de lancement de l'euro (source: Rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). L' euro est egalement utilise au plan international comme intermediaire dans les echanges et unite de compte. C'est tout d'abord une monnaie « vehicule »essentielle sur le marche des changes. L' euro est en effet intervenu dans 1/Seme des transactions de change classiques en 2001(statistiques BR!) et le couple euro/dollar fait l'objet des transactions les plus importantes, avec 30 % des vol<U+FFFD>mes globaux recenses en 2001. L'utilisation de l' euro comme monna1e de facturation du commerce international s'accroit, meme s'il est difficile de trouver des donnees agregees et harmonisees pour la zone euro dans son ensemble sur cet aspect. Entre 2001 et mi-2002, la part de l'euro dans le commerce exterieur de biens et services de lazone euro a augmente de fac;on significative, surtout avec les zones geographiquement les plus proches, pour atteindre globalement une part comprise entre 40 % et 50 % ( source : Quarterly Review of the use of the euro, · Commission, donnees reprises dans le rapport BCE 2002 sur le role international de l'euro). - 10 -1.2.2- LE ROLE INTERNATIONAL OFFICIEL DE L'EUROL'euro est une monnaie de reference pour de nombreux regimes de change adoptes par des pays tiers: plus de 50 pays ont adopte l'euro comme reference ou ancre monetaire, plus particulierement dans les zones geographiques proches. C'est egalement la seconde monnaie dans les reserves de change mondiales: sa part s 'etablissait a 13 % a la fin 2001 ( donnees FMI), contre 68 % pour le dollar et 5 % pour le yen. En outre, en 2002, plusieurs communiques de presse et declarations officielles de divers pays, notamment la Chine, la Coree, la Russie, le Pakistan et la Roumanie, ont fait etat de !'augmentation par ces pays de la part de l'euro dans leurs reserves de change ou de leur intention d'aller dans ce sens. II. MEME SI LES NECESSllRES REFORMES STRUCTURELLES DOIVENT ENCORE ETRE POURSUIVIES, L'UEM CONST ITUE D'ORES ET DEJA UNE ZONE COMPETITIVE E-:C:.COHERENTE ' 11.1- NECESSITE DE POURSUIVRE LES REFORMES STRUCTURELLES Le passage a !'Euro a constitue en soi une reforme structurelle majeure et un puissant facteur de modernisation de l 'economie europeenne. Pour continuer dans cette voie, l'accroissement de la competitivite globale de nos economies passe par la moderation des couts unitaires de production. Si l'on se rapporte a !'experience economique recente de Ia France la strate!rie' e, fran<U+FFFD>aise dite de desinflation competitive nous a donne un tres grand avantage:-11 --------- -------les gains importants de competitivite-cofit emegistres dans le secteur industriel fram;ais a partir du milieu des annees quatre-vingt ont en effet largement contribue a favoriser la croissance, les creations d'emplois et la solidite des comptes exterieurs. La poursuite d'une strategie de desinflation competitive au niveau de la zone euro doit s'appuyer sur un ensemble de reformes sur le marche du travail et sur le marche des biens. 11.1.1- NECESSITE DE PROMOUVOm IA FLEXIBILITE DU MARCHE DU TRA VAIL Globalement, on peut estimer que le chomage reste a 70 % de nature structurelle, que la differenciation des salaires entre secteurs demeure insuffisante, et que le cout du travail s'avere encore trop eleve. Dans ce domaine, les reformes principales a mener concement : - l' augmentation de la quantite de travail disponible: le Conseil europeen deLisbonne en mars 2000 a fixe comme objectif central d'elever le taux d'emploi de nos populations de 61 a 70 % en 10 ans, sachant qu'il avoisine 75 % aux Etats-Unis ; - la suppression des trappes a inactivite et a pauvrete, par la reduction descontributions sociales a la charge des employeurs et le developpement de la formation; - le developpement des deux principaux mecanismes d'adaptation que sont laflexibilite des salaires et la mobilite du travail. 11.1.2- NECESSITE D'HARMONISER L'ENVIRONNEMENT REGLEMENTAIRE CONCURRENTIEL ET FISCAL, SUR LE MARCHE DES BIENS ET SERVICES --------- · . <U+FFFD> --- --12 -De son cote, !'integration progressive du marche europeen des biens et services se poursuit. On peut ici evoquer le renouvellement des reglementations relatives aux marches des telecommunications, de l'electricite et du gaz. Toutefois, on note que seuls 7 pays de la zone ont atteint le taux de transposition des directives europeennes cible pour 2002, soit 98,5%. L'effort de transposition doit done etre poursuivi. En outre, des efforts supplementaires doivent etre accomplis pour : - simplifier et harmoniser I' environnement reglementaire, dans le domaine desservices aux entreprises et aux particuliers ; - soutenir le developpement des petites et moyennes entreprises ;- favoriser !'acceleration des gains de productivite du travail (modernisation dessystemes d 'information) ; - soutenir les efforts de Recherche et Developpement: investissements,chercheurs - diminuer les subventions publiques.II.2- ... L'UEM EST UNE ZONE COMPETITIVE ET COHERENTEIl.2.1- L'UEM PRESENTE UN HAUT NIVEAU DE COMPETITIVITE, EN MATIEREDE PRIX ET DE COUT La zone euro et la France sont particulierement attractives, du fait de fondamentaux macroeconomiques sains et de !'absence de desequilibres majeurs. Le niveau d'inflation y est faible et stable sur le long terme, les comptes extemes sont equilibres, I' epargne privee est abondante, et le systeme financier - 13 -est sain, comme l'etablit le rapport du Comite de Surveillance Bancaire du SEBC (BSC), publie en fevrier 2003. La qualite de la main d'reuvre europeenne est un autre atout d'importance, avec le haut niveau d'education et de formation observe (5% du PIB consacre a!'education), ainsi que la maitrise affichee des langues etrangeres. La qualite des infrastructuresn'est pas en reste, que ce soit en matiere de transports, d'energie, de telecommunications ou de nouvelles technologies. Tous ces facteurs contribuent a expliquer la bonne tenue des flux d'investissements directs vers la zone euro et plus particulierement vers la France. Selon les donnees de la Balance des Paiements, la France est le zcme pays d'accueil des investissements directs en 2002 apres la Chine, avec 49,9 Mds EUR. Depuis la mise en place de l'euro, au debut de 1999, le total des investissements directs etrangers en France s'eleve ainsi a environ 200 Mds EUR, ce qui traduit une nette progession par rapport aux annees precedentes. Les investissements directs etrangers dans la zone euro, pour leur part, ont represente 720 Mds EUR entre 1999 et 2001, et 85 Mds EUR sur les 8 premiers mois de 2002. 11.2.2- L' ARCHITECTURE FINANCIERE COMMUNE RENFORCE LA STABILITE .ECONOMIQUE ET FINANCIERE DE LA ZONE EURO L'Eurosysteme a salue la decision du Conseil europeen de Lisbonne en mars 2000 consistant a accelerer la realisation du marche interieur des services financiers et visant a mettre en reuvre le Plan d 'action sur Ies servicesfinanciers d'ici 2005. Ce Plan est regulierement passe en revue par Ies autorites europeennes et des progres importants ont ete realises : a fin 2002, 32 chapitres -14 -sur 42 ont en effet ete mis en reuvre, dont notamment le reglement sur les paiements transfrontaliers en euro (2001), le statut de Societe europeenne et la Directive de decembre 2002 sur les conglomerats financiers. La zone euro beneficie, par ailleurs, de mecanismes reglementaires prudentiels coherents et flexibles, comme I'ont etabli deux rapports du Comite econornique et financier (avril 2000 et avril 2001). Ces mecanismes permettent de mesurer et de limiter les risques d'instabilite au sein du secteur bancaire, du secteur des assurances et sur le marche des titres. En outre, une nouvelle architecture institutionnelle est en cou.rs de constitution dans I'U.E. dans le domaine de la reglementation et de la supervision du secteur financier (banques, assurances, marches de titres). L'Eurosysteme a soutenu les conclusions du Comite preside par A.Lamfalussy sur I 'integration des marches de titres europeens ; nous sommes convaincus que la mise en reuvre - decidee a Ia fin de 2002 - de ces grandes orientations dans I' ensemble du secteur financier, et les nouvelles structures de cooperation au niveau europeen qui en decoulent, contribueront a renforcer la stabilite du systeme financier. La stabilite financiere peut ainsi etre consideree comme la deuxieme mission confiee a l'Eurosysteme par le Traite. Plus speciquement, le Traite prevoit que l'Eurosysteme doit contribuer a Ia bonne conduite des politiques en matiere prudentielle et a la stabilite du systeme financier. Les responsabilites particulieres des banques centrales decoulent de leur positionnement au creur des systemes financiers: leur role de fournisseur de liquidite de l'economie, Ieurs contacts etroits et constants avec Jes etablissements de credit, leur contribution a la surveillance bancaire et au - 15 -fonctionnement sfu et efficient des systemes de paiement et, au moins pour certaines d 'entre elles, leur contribution a un fonctionnement sfir et efficient des systemes de compensation et de reglement de titres. Je suis convaincu que la participation des banques centrales, dans ces domaines, demeurera absolument essentielle. En matiere de lutte contre le blanchiment, enfin, la Cooperation juridique internationale s'intensifie. Depuis les tragiques evenements du 11 septembre, les inquietudes relatives a la possible utilisation du systeme financier pour financer le terrorisme sont devenues prioritaires dans les debats internationaux et europeens sur la reglementation. La communaute internationale, et en son sein, la communaute financiere, renforce ses efforts pour traquer les fonds utilises par le crime organise et le terrorisme. Nous progressons car il existe aujourd'hui, une forte determination politique de la communaute internationale et des instances europeennes competentes, en faveur d'une cooperation sur cette question. Face a ce defi majeur pour la cohesion de la zone euro, celle-ci dispose de divers instruments de coordination. - 16 -ill.I- LA ZONE EURO DISPOSE D'UN CADRE DE POLITIQUE ECONOMIQUE A MOYEN TERME ASSURANT SA COHESION INTERNE. III.1.1- DES PROCEDURES MULTIIATERALES INSTITUTIONNALISEESUn cadre operationnel coherent a ete mis en place pour la coordination des politiques economiques par la voie d'une surveillance mutuelle etroite, sous la responsabilite de l 'Eurogroupe et du Conseil Ecofin. En encadrant les deficits publics des Etats membres de la zone euro, lePacte de Stabilite et de Croissance permet de coordonner les politiques budgetaires. C'est la un complement indispensable a la politique monetaire, notamment pour contrebalancer le fait que !'Europe ne dispose pas d'un important budget federal. En instituant un systeme de sanctions en cas de deficits excessifs, le Pacte contribue egalement a eviter que des economies bien gerees n'aient a supporter une prime de risque injustifiee, en provenance des economies presentant d'importants deficits, et qui serait transferee sur elles par le canal de la monnaie unique. En outre, les Grandes orientations de politique economique, approuvees chaque annee par les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement, contribuent au suivi des evolutions macroeconomiques et structurelles dans les Etats membres. Elles n'ont pas a proprement parler de valeur contraignante, puisque leur non-respect ne donne pas lieu a des sanctions. Elles constituent cependant un instrument central dans la coordination des politiques economiques, dont le contenu s'est precise au fil des annees. Elles sont par ailleurs adoptees par le Conseil ECOFIN, ce qui permet a la pression des pairs de s'exer<U+FFFD>er. - 17 -111.1.2- LA PRISE EN COMPTE DES CHOCS ASYMETRIQUES En pressant les pays de parvenir, a moyen terme, a une situation budgetaire « proche de l'equilibre ou en excedent », le Pacte tolere une augmentation des deficits en periode difficile, a condition de ne pas depasser la valeur de reference de 3 %. En bref, il autorise les pays membres a creer un « volant de securite »budgetaire durant les phases de conjoncture economique normales, susceptible d'etre utilise pour faire face a des divergences economiques ou a des chocs asymetriques. ill.1.3- LA CONVERGENCE DES ECONOMIES DE IA ZONE EURO L'Union monetaire n'implique pas necessairement que tous les pays participants affichent, a tout moment, le meme taux d'inflation ou de croissance, meme si la creation de l'euro reposait sur la reussite du processus de convergence. Ainsi des ecarts d'inflation entre pays ou regions sent acceptables dans une union monetaire car ils s 'integrent dans le processus de convergence de la productivite et des niveaux de vie. En fait, la dispersion d'inflation entre pays de la zone euro est similaire a celle constatee entre les differents etats des Etats-Unis. Une zone monetaire est jugee optimale si et seulement si il y a une forte correlation des cycles economiques dans les pays membres, une libre circulation des facteurs de production ou un budget federal suffisant pour amortir les chocs. En pratique, les structures economiques doivent aussi etre suffisamment - 18 -. a la politique monetairesemblables pour que la reaction de l'econom1e b 1 t 1 zone euro correspond acommune soit similaire entre les pays.

ID.2- LA REUSSITE DURABLE DE L'ELARGISSEMENT SUPPOSE LA CONVERGENCE DES STRUCTURES ECONO111QUES ET FINANCIERES DES PAYS CANDIDATS. m.2.1.- IA CONVERGENCE REELLE, UN PROCESSUS PROGRESSIF ET DE LONGTERMELa convergence reelle correspond a la fois au processus de convergence des revenus reels, mais aussi au processus de convergence structurelle et institutionnelle, qm implique. !'adaptation des structures economiques, l'etablissement d'institutions adequates, !'adoption des pratiques et standards reconnus intemationalement. A ce titre, l'integration economique deja importante des pays candidats avec la zone euro constitue un point positif: Ia zone euro absorbe 58 % des exportations totales des pays candidats ( contre un commerce intra qui represente 50,4 % des exportations des actuels Etats membres de la zone euro) ; les pays candidats absorbent 13 % du total des exportations de la zone euro (part identique a celle des Etats-Unis) et ant contribue pour les 2/3 a la croissance de la demande exterieure globale adressee a la zone en 2000-01. - 19 -Toutefois, l'ecart en termes de PIB moyen par habitant entre les pays candidats1 et la moyenne de la zone euro demeure encore tres important. Le PIB moyen par habitant dans les pays candidats en 2002 ne represente en effet que 44 % de la moyenne de la zone euro, en parite de pouvoir d'achat, et 20 % sur la base des taux de change courants. Or, le differentiel de croissance entre Jes pays candidats et Ia zone euro reste encore limite et ne permet pas un rattrapage rapide du niveau de vie. Ce differentiel de croissance ne s'est eleve qu'a 0,5 point par an en moyenne en 1999-2001. En 2002, il a certes progresse pour s'etablir entre 1,3 et 1,7 point, la croissance du PIB ayant ete estimee a 2,3 % dans les pays candidats contre 0,6/1 % dans la zone euro ( estimations Eurostat et BCE). A ce rythme, en moyenne, les pays candidats ne rattraperaient le niveau relatif de la Grece qu'en 2025. Bien sur, les situations individuelles sont tres differenciees. C'est pourquoi les reformes structurelles revetent egalement une importance cruciale pour les pays candidats, en ce qui conceme notamment le marche du travail et la qualite des systemes bancaires, ceci afin de creer les conditions d'un rattrapage plus rapide. . ·- - -<U+FFFD>. -- - . . . -ill.2.2- L'IMPORTANCE DE SYSTEMES BANCAIRES ET FINANCIERS SAINS, EFFICACES ET BIEN SUPERVISES Le processus de liberalisation des mouvements de capitaux en cours dans les pays candidats implique la mise en reuvre de reformes structurelles dans le secteur financier et un renforcement de la supervision. A cet egard, la I Les 10 fulurs Elats mcmbres en 2004: Chypre, Eslonie, Hongrie, Lenonie, Lituanic, Malle, Pologne, Republique slovaque, Rcpublique tchcque el Slovcnie ; enlrcc prcvue de la Bulgarie el Roumanie en 2007. - 20-restructuration et la consolidation des systemes financiers et bancaires, deja bien avancees, doivent etre poursuivies par les pays candidats. Le ratio actifs bancaires/PIB ne represente en effet en moyenne qu'un quart de celui de la zone euro et s'echelonne de 27 % en Lituanie a 389 % a Malte en 2001, contre 265 % pour la zone euro (source: Accession Briefing 2002, BCE). Le ratio credit interieur/PIB ne represente en moyenne qu'un tiers de celui de la zone euro ; il s'etablit en 2001 entre 11,5 % en Lituanie et 109 % a Chypre et Malte, contre 107 % pour la zone euro (source: Accession Briefing 2002, BCE). Les marches financiers sont encore peu developpes. Le ratio capitalisation boursiere /PIB s'eleve en 2001 a 14 % en Pologne, 16 % en Republique tcheque, 19 % en Hongrie, contre 72 % pour la zone euro. ill.2.3- LA CONVERGENCE LEGALE ET INSTITUTIONNELLE, UN PROCESSUS FAISANT L'OBJET D'UN SUIVI ATIENTIF L'Eurosysteme prete naturellement une attention toute particuliere al'independance des banques centrales, qui est un des aspects de la convergence legale et institutionnelle. II s'agit la d'une exigence juridique prealable pour l'entree dans l'UE, et a fortiori dans l <U+FFFD>urosysteme. L'independance implique ala fois la mise en conformite du statut de la banque centrale avec les dispositions communautaires et une mise en reuvre effective. 11 est encourageante de noter que les reformes legislatives engagees ces deux dernieres annees dans Ies pays candidats ont, dans l 'ensemble, permis de rendre les statuts des banques centrales globalement compatibles avec l'acquis communautaire. - 21 -ID.3- LA CONVERGENCE NOMINALE DOIT REPOSER SUR DES STRATEGIES SOUTENABLES Tous les nouveaux Etats membres de l'UE ont vocation a adopter a terme l'euro, des lors qu'ils auront rempli les criteres prevus par le Traite, de maniere soutenable. Leurs efforts devront done porter, tant sur les finances publiques que sur la politique de desinflation et les strategies de change. lli.3.1- AMELIORER IA SITUATION BUDGETAIRE ET EXTERIEURE DES PAYSCANDIDATS Les finances publiques de plusieurs pays candidats soot sous tension. Le deficit public moyen pondere s'est eleve a 3,6 % du PIB en 2001, avec des valeurs allant jusqu'a 5,3 % du PIB en Pologne ou 4 % en Slovaquie. La maitrise des depenses publiques constitue une necessite absolue pour respecter le critere nominal de Maastricht relatif au deficit public, d'autant plus que ces pays devront par ailleurs financer d'importants besoins d'investissements (notamment publics) afin d'assurer la convergence reelle avec la zone euro. En outre, la structure· fiscale actuelle des· pays candidats, caracterisee par la pression· croissante des transferts sociaux et le poids des depenses liees, limite la marge de manreuvre pour une reduction des depenses publiques. Le creusement des deficits courants doit etre egalement maitrise. Le deficit courant moyen a atteint 4,6 % du PIB en 2002, avec des valeurs allant jusqu'a 9,4 % du PIB en Lettonie, 8,1 % en Slovaquie, 6,8 % en Estonie. La projection du deficit courant moyen en 2003 s'etablit a 4,7 % (source: Accession Briefing2002, BCE). La reduction des deficits courants est d'autant plus importante dans - 22 -• la perspective de la perte, a terme, de !'instrument du taux de change, a la suitede l'entree en Union monetaire. ill.3.2- ASSURER LA SOUTENABILITE DU PROCESSUS DE CONVE RGENCE NOMINALE Le processus de desinflation se poursuit dans les pays candidats. II constitue lagrande reussite de la decennie passee, marquee par le passage d 'une inflation moyenne de 2 a 1 chiffres (8,5 % en 2001 en moyenne ). En 2002, le niveau d'inflation moyen dans les pays candidats a continue de se rapprocher du taux d'inflation moyen dans la zone euro ( 4,0 % dans les pays candidats au 3eme trimestre 2002 contre 2,1 % dans la zone euro). Les processus de convergence reelle et nominale sont complementaires. D'unepart, la convergence reelle favorise la conve rgence nominale. En effet, les reformes structurelles conduisent a un environnement de taux d'inflation etd'interet plus faibles et permettent une amelioration des conditions de l'offre de l 'economie ainsi qu 'un accroissement du potentiel de croissance. Par ailleurs, la convergence <U+FFFD>ee!J.e entraine u_ne reduction des risques et des effets de chocs asymetriques. D'autre part, la convergence nominale favorise la convergence reelle en assurant un ancrage des anticipations d 'inflation et la stabilite de l' environnement ma_croeconomique, et en encourageant le commerce et l 'investissement.Par consequent, les convergences reelle et nominale doivent etre poursuivies en parallele. II convient en particulier de ne pas se focaliser en premier lieu sur une convergence nominale trop rapide, faite au detriment de la convergence structurelle, et qui risquerait de ne pas etre soutenable dans la duree. Les- 23 -marches financiers peuvent egalement contribuer a une convergence artificielle de certaines variables nominales, a travers les « convergence plays», c'est-a­dire les anticipations d'une date d'entree precise de tel ou tel pays dans la zone euro. Ces anticipations sont facteurs de risques, car elles peuvent par exemple contribuer a une convergence sur les marches des taux d'interet a long terme vers les niveaux prevalant dans la zone euro, qui serait prematuree car non justifiee par une convergence des fondamentaux economiques. Ce risque ne doit pas etre sous-estime. On a ainsi pu relever, tres recemment, un spread de taux d'interet negatif entre les obligations a 8 ans du Tresor tcheque et les obligations du Bund allemand (-14 points de base au 06/02/03). La poursuite en parallele des convergence reelle et nominale est d'autant plus necessaire qu'il convient d'assurer la soutenabilite de la convergence nominale. En effet, conformement au Traite, !'examen des criteres de convergence economique en vue de I' entree en zone euro donnera lieu a une evaluation du caractere soutenable des resultats obtenus dans les differents domaines (inflation, finances publiques, taux d'interet). ill.3.3- IMPORTANCE PRIMORDIALE DES STRATEGIES DE CHANGE DANS LE MAINTIEN DE IA STABILITE MACROECONOMIQUE Les strategies de change suivies par les pays candidats se caracterisent par leurgrande variete actuelle, des currency boards (Bulgarie, Estonie, Li tuanie) auflottement (Pologne, Republique tcheque) en passant par un regime de bandes defluctuation (+/- 15%) autour d'une parite fixe par rapport a I'euro (Chypre,Hongrie depuis 2001). On note que les monnaies des pays candidats (a !'exception naturellement des currency boards) enregistrent actuellement de fortes fluctuations nominales par- 24-rapport a l'euro, en particulier le zloty polonais, le forint hongrois et la couronne tcheque. Apres l'entree dans l'UE, la politique de change reste une competence nationale, mais doit s'inscrire dans le cadre de l'objectif de stabilite des prix. Dans cette phase, la participation au nouveau mecanisme de change europeen (MCE 2) apparait particulierement utile, comme instrument de convergence assurant un dosage adequat de discipline et de flexibilite. Le MCE 2 doit ainsi etre considere comme une salle d 'entrainement ( « training room ») et non une simple salle d'attente avant !'adoption de l'euro («waiting room»). 11 doit notamment permettre un apprentissage progressif de !'abandon de !'instrument de change: il constitue en effet un cadre institutionnel souple, car il permet les realignements de taux de change et assoit la credibilite du processus de stabilisation progressive du change par son caractere multilateral. Le MCE2 presente par ailleurs des avantages plus fondamentaux : il assure en particulier l'ancrage des anticipations d'inflation des agents, et par la meme incite aux reformes structurelles pour preserver la competitivite. La participation au MCE 2 est egalement un critere de convergence. Le Traite prevoit precisement deux exigences en ce domaine: le respect des marges normales de fluctuation prevues par le MCE 2 pendant 2 ans au moins, sans devaluation; le caractere durable de la convergence atteinte etde la participation au MCE 2, qui se reflete dans les niveaux des taux d'interet a long terme. La participation au MCE 2 constitue done une periode de test pour le cours pivot choisi et la soutenabilite de la convergence. Elle permet en particulier de definir la parite appropriee pour !'adoption, a terme, de l'euro. - 25 -------------II convient de noter que !'evaluation du critere de stabilite du change sera basee, comme cela a ete le cas depuis 1998, sur la proximite entre le taux de change et le cours-pivot, et pas seulement sur le respect de la marge de fluctuation standard de+/- 15 %. D'une maniere generale, on peut estimer que les differents pays devront suivre une approche au cas par cas, tant pour la decision relative a la date d'entree dans le MCE 2 que pour la duree de leur participation. Ces decisions devront etre prises en fonction des conditions economiques (en termes nominaux, reels et structurels ), de la coherence du policy mix, de la taille, des structures economiques et du track record du pays concerne. En effet, une entree prematuree dans le MCE2 pourrait causer une accentuation de la volatilite du change et entrainer un risque de crise et de contagion. Enfin, en ce qui conceme la duree de participation, il apparait particulierement dangereux de faire d'une reforme fondamentale telle que !'adoption de l'euro, un simple objectif de court terme.

Mme Nathalie AUFAUVRE Le 23 novembre 2009 Chere Nth 1. a a Ie Aufauvre , Votre disc 't' · ' b' I re ion et votre modestie sont legendaires. Et pourtant, ce so1r, c est 1en vous que a Republique et la Banque de France ont souhaite honorer a !'occasion de la remise de cette decoration qui, a juste titre, vous a ete decemee en mai demi er. Re~ue a un rang tres honorable au concours d'adjoint de direction de 1983, vous integrez la Banque de France le ler fevrier 1984. Votre promotion ne compte que 5 femmes pour 27 hommes. On est loin alors de la parite dont on s'est beaucoup rapproche ces dernieres annees (12 femmes pour 13 hommes en 2008). Oserai-je dire que, avec une simple licence de sciences economiques, vous etes alors ... la moins diplomee ? Mais vous vous rattraperez vite. J'y reviendrai. Apres Ia scolarite a l'IDEF et un stage en succursale a Neuilly-Levallois, vous integrez les services de la Balance des Paiements a la DGSE ou vous vous faites immediatement remarquer pour votre sens des relations humaines et vos qualites de plume. Tout en travaillant a la Banque vous poursuivez vos etudes pour obtenir d'abord votre maitrise de sciences econorniques et, dans la foulee, vous poursuivez par le cursus de l'IEP de paris, section economique et financiere, dont vous obtiendrez le diplome en 1990, major avec les felicitations du jury. C'est-a-dire, dans la botte des tout premiers re~us au diplome de Sciences-Po. Entre temps, vous avez quitte les services de la Balance des Paiements et rejoint le service des Changes ou vous serez la premiere femme dans le milieu tres masculin des cambistes qui, parait-il ont pu avoir, pour certains d'entre eux au moins, un regard un peu narquois a votre arrivee. Vous saurez pourtant tres vite vous imposer et en imposer. Non seulement par votre sens du marche, votre connaissance des techniques financieres et votre grande maitrise des outils informatiques. Mais aussi par la qualite de vos analyses, votre esprit positif et constructif et, ici encore, vos qualites humaines, que remarque l'un de vos notateurs d'alors, Jean-Paul Redouin. Votre sang froid et votre flegme sont particulierement apprecies, notamment aux moments de tension sur les marches. Vous poursuivez ainsi votre carriere a la direction du marche des capitaux, jusqu'a occuper, aupres d'Isabelle Strauss Khan, les fonctions d'adjointe du directeur des Operation de Marche. A la demande de M. Bruneel, vous presidez de main de maitre le groupe de reflexion sur le Metier 6, compose de 4 hommes et 4 femmes, qui a debouche, grace a votre force de conviction, sur la fusion au debut des annees 2000 des salles de marche « franc » et «devises» et la creation de la direction du back-office au sein de la Direction generale des operations. Non sans tact, vous avez contribue a faire tomber barrieres et frontieres ... notamment les plus etanches et les plus difficiles a ebranler : celles qui sont dans les tetes. De meme, vous avez assure une mission d'expertise remarquable au moment du passage a l'Euro. En depit d'un pouce casse, vous avez bien redige et mene a bien cette tache, a la grande satisfaction de Xavier Debonneuil. Comment avez-vous fait ? 2 . 'b . , · te a la demande de M. Robert, a Je mentionnerai auss1, en passant, votre contr1 ut10n emmen , un rapport sur la crise de 1992. ' h' · · 1 t"" h sans vous departir du calme qui vous Vous avez montre que vous ne rec 1gruez pas a a ac e caracterise, tout en jouant collectif et en valorisant !es potentiels. Vous avez aussi fait montre d'une tres grande capacite d'anticipation. Qualite eminente, qui se revele fort utile dans !es importantes fonctions que vous occupez aujourd'hui a la tete de la Direction financiere et du controle de gestion. Ace titre, vous gerez le budget de la Banque : ses depenses mais aussi ses recettes. Vous participez notamment au comite des risques et au comite de gestion actif-passif ou se revelent vos qualites analytiques et votre capacite a donner au Gouvernement de Ia Banque des conseils avises. S'ajoute a, vos fonctions une dimension europeenne puisque vous participez activement a plusieurs comites du SEBC aux noms un peu etranges : AMICO, BUCOM et COMCO. Ainsi, apres avoir demontre en debut de carriere que vous saviez bien ecrire, , vous prouvez aujourd'hui que vous savez compter et bien compter, ce qui est tres rassurant pour le Gouvemement de Ia Banque. Bien que vous soyez per~ue par tous comme calme et discrete, ii se dit qu'a !'occasion de vos deplacements professionnels, vous vous laissez aller parfois a quelques excentricites, que I'on a peine a imaginer. Ainsi, a Chypre, ii vous est arrive, m'a-t-on rapporte, de participer a Ia danse du verre, Ia « datsia » : on a du mal a vous imaginer perchee sur une chaise en train d'empiler, sur fond musical, verres sur verres (pleins evidemment) sur la tete du danseur. Et pourtant, vous I'avez fait, sans rien renverser, a Ia grande admiration de vos collegues des 3 autres banques centrales. Encore, une preuve de votre sens de l'equilibre. Et en plus, nous voila rassure sur votre sens de la rete. Cela me fournit une bonne transition pour parler maintenant un peu plus de votre personnalite. Je souhaite d'abord saluer votre epoux qui etait de la meme promotion d' AD que vous (il a quitte la Banque depuis). II se disait, parmi les autres jeunes femmes, que vous « aviez recupere le plus beau de la promotion». Voila qui est flatteur pour lui, vexant sans doute pour les autres . . . mais qui revele bien vos qualites de fraicheur et de seduction. Votre calme apparent cache un caractere bien trempe, parfois meme une « tete de pioche ». C'est ainsi que, toute jeune deja, brillante eleve au lycee, admise en prepa HEC a Janson de Sailly vous aviez renonce a vous presenter au concours des grandes ecoles de commerce. Apres avoir envisage de vous lancer dans l'archeologie apres un voyage en Crete, ou de devenir chanteuse de varietes ou de rock, vous aviez finalement opte pour les etudes en economie puis le concours de la Banque. Certains se souviennent encore du discours de fin de promotion d' AD3 que vous avez prepare et declame avec une de vos collegues. II ne manquait, parait-il, pas d'humour ni de causticite. Je voudrais saluer egalement votre attachement a votre famille. Votre maman trop tot disparue, votre pere ici present, vos freres aines. Vos trois enfants Jeanne, Camille et Alexandre dont vous etes si proche, peuvent etre tiers de leur maman qui, non sans mal parfois, concilie une attention toute particuliere a leur egard et une implication sans faille dans son travail. Je n'oublie pas votre epoux, tres investi egalement dans sa vie professionnelle. Je 4 I crois que vous . avez tous trouve sur l'Ile de Re le lieu de vos reves, devenu le site des ' retrouvailles en f: ·11 , rum e ou vous pratiquez velo et la marche a pied. Chere Nathalie Aufauvre, permettez-moi egalement d'evoquer le souvenir de votre grand-mere matemelle, Luce O'Diette, dont vous etiez tres proche et avec qui, je le sais, vous avez beaucoup discute et partage une grande complicite. Epouse d'un officier de cavalerie, tombe au front dans la Somme en 1940, elle s' etait engagee dans la Resistance en fabriquant notarnment des faux papiers a la Prefecture de Nantes ou elle avait ete recrutee pour gagner sa vie. Arretee et deportee a Ravensbruck, rapatriee sur un brancard, constatant a son retour a Nantes, la destruction de sa maison, revenue a Paris, elle a repris vie et combat pour finalement disparaitre en 1981, centenaire. Elle etait titulaire de la Croix de Guerre et Officier de la Legion d'Honneur. Je ne doute pas que l'exemple de sa determination, de son experience, de sa sagesse et de sa hauteur de vue vous guide dans la vie. Permettez-moi enfin d'evoquer un autre de vos tres lointains ancetres par votre grand-pere matemel. Je veux parler du Baron Jean-Charles Joachim Davillier qui fut Gouverneur de la Banque de France du 12 fevrier au 5 septembre 1836 et siegea 45 ans au Conseil de Regence, de 1801 a sa mort en 1846. Peu d'agents de la Banque peuvent aujourd'hui se prevaloir d'un ancetre gouvemeur ... Je souhaite pour vous que cela soit un signe premonitoire de votre evolution professionnelle au sein de notre maison. 5 I I Determination, discretion, disponibilite, humour, ecoute et esprit collectif, attention aux autres sont les qualites qui vous caracterisent et c'est a hon droit, comme je l'ai dit au debut demon intervention, que la Republique a reconnu vos merites. C'est pourquoi, Nathalie Aufauvre, au nom du President de la Republique, nous vous faisons Chevalier dans l'Ordre National du Merite. 6 ","christian noyer"
"22","discours","12.06.2010","Microsoft Word - CN2_Convention_6_12.docx  Intervention Christian Noyer  Nous voici réunis pour la troisième fois en convention. Sachez que j’en suis très heureux.  Je crois important que nous fassions le point chaque année sur l’évolution de notre environnement, la stratégie de la Banque et la manière dont elle se développe, jour après jour, grâce à votre mobilisation et à celle de tous vos collaborateurs. Lors de notre précédent rendez-vous, nous avions analysé les deux années de crise – crise   financière puis économique. Nous savions alors que la sortie de cette crise sans précédent serait longue et difficile.  L’année 2010 a pleinement justifié notre prudence. L’endettement massif des États a créé des fortes inquiétudes sur la capacité de la zone euro à retrouver le chemin de la croissance. La Grèce d’abord puis l’Irlande aujourd’hui, ont dû se résoudre à faire appel à l’Europe et au FMI.  Face à cette montée des risques, des solutions ont été trouvées : l’Europe a mis en place un système pérenne qui permet aux États les plus fragiles de se refinancer, l’Eurosystème a choisi de lancer un programme de rachat de titres de dette souveraine afin que ses décisions en matière de taux d’intérêt conservent tous leurs effets dans les économies de la zone euro.  Dans ce contexte tendu, la Banque de France a continué de jouer un rôle de premier plan en apportant son expertise, ses solutions, son énergie au service de l’intérêt général.  C’est pàr un bref rappel de ce qu’a représenté 2010 pour la Banque que je vais commencer . J’évoquerai ensuite le cadre rénové dans lequel s’inscrit désormais notre stratégie de moyen terme. Enfin, je détaillerai ce qui doit constituer nos priorités pour 2011.      n 2010 : une année de mobilisation Cette année 2010 a été chargée pour chacun d’entre vous.  Je m’adresse d’abord au réseau de la Banque qui se voit confier des taches toujours plus importantes et toujours plus difficile. Vous avez su, avec efficacité et rigueur, mener de front ces missions, trouver des réponses face à la montée du surendettement ou des difficultés de trésorerie des entreprises.  - D’abord, la médiation du crédit, puisque grâce à l’action des directeurs départementaux et des équipes Entreprises du réseau, 12 000 entreprises ont pu résoudre leurs difficultés de trésorerie ou de financement, et 220 000 emplois être sauvegardés.  - Ensuite, l’accompagnement des particuliers. Avec plus de 200 000 dossiers nouveaux déposés, le traitement du surendettement est resté à son plus haut niveau sans que cela n’ait d’impact sur les délais de traitement. Les dispositions de la loi Lagarde doivent maintenant être intégrées ; je ne doute pas que cela sera fait dans les meilleures conditions par les 1 500 agents du réseau impliqués dans cette mission.  - Désormais, pour les hommes politiques, pour les acteurs économiques, vous êtes le bras armé de toute action de soutien économique d’ampleur nationale. Vous êtes devenus incontournables et c’est à vos résultats que vous le devez.   2010 a été aussi l’année de la création de l’Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, qui rassemble 900 personnes venus d’horizons divers au service de la supervision bancaire et assurantielle.. Fusionner 4 autorités n’est pas une mince affaire. Je sais tout le travail que cela a pu représenter, d’abord  pour ceux qui étaient directement concernés, mais aussi pour  ceux qui ont travaillé sur les moyens techniques apportés à la nouvelle structure : l’informatique, l’immobilier, les ressources humaines, etc. Je tiens à les remercier ici. Je sais qu’une fusion c’est aussi la confrontation de cultures et de modes de fonctionnement différents. De ce fait, apprendre à travailler ensemble n’est toujours simple. Je tiens toutefois à souligner la qualité de travail que vous avez su produire que ce soit dans les instances européennes et internationales – j’y reviendrai - comme dans le travail quotidien : missions de contrôle, mise en place de la surveillance des pratiques commerciales… j’y ajouterai une mention spéciale pour l’excellent travail qui a été fait lors de l’élaboration de Stress tests   européennes, dans des conditions souvent périlleuses. L’adossement de l’ACP à la Banque de France a pris tout son sens à cette occasion puisque ce fut un travail commun.  Enfin, 2010 a aussi été l’année d’évolutions réglementaires majeures. Les travaux conduits sous l’égide du G20 au Comité de Bâle et au Forum de stabilité financière ou au sein des autorités européennes et notamment au CEIOPS pour l’assurance, ont débouché sur des réformes essentielles pour la solidité des systèmes bancaires et financiers : les nouveaux dispositifs de surveillance micro et macro-prudentielle ont été adoptés par le Parlement européen, les nouveaux critères d’appréciation de la solvabilité des banques (Bâle 3) ont été finalisés et les travaux pour l’adoption des nouvelles normes assurancielles (Solvency 2) progressent.   n Les axes stratégiques et les principaux objectifs de la Banque   Je souhaiterais vous présenter sous la forme d’une « carte stratégique », les 4 axes stratégiques qui orientent notre action et les objectifs qui en découlent   Premier axe : Conforter notre position dans l’Eurosystème C’est une réalité depuis plusieurs années : le besoin d’une gestion efficiente des ressources de l’Eurosystème, couplé à une intégration européenne croissante, pose la question du positionnement de chacune des banques centrales nationales. Nous sommes la banque centrale de la deuxième économie de la zone euro ;nous avons fait le choix d’être une banque centrale influente, capable de peser dans les décisions de l’Eurosystème, et présente dans des réalisations concrètes. Ce premier axe se décline en 3 objectifs : 1) Accroître notre influence dans la définition et la mise en œuvre de la politique monétaire : il s’agit de notre expertise en matière de valorisation du collatéral des opérations de politique monétaire qui nous permet d’assurer des valorisations pour le compte de l’Eurosystème, dans le cadre du projet CEPH.  2) Cibler des offres attractives pour l’Eurosystème : Nous l’avons déjà fait avec Target 2 et Target 2 Titres, dont nous assurons la direction de projet pour une mise en production en 2014. Aujourd’hui, nous avons une proposition conjointe avec la Banque d’Espagne, de   développer et d’héberger en tandem la plate-forme des opérations de marché MOP. Ce projet a été retenu. C’est plus qu’un succès, c’est la reconnaissance de la qualité et de la solidité de notre approche. 3) Renforcer notre positionnement opérationnel sur les marchés : Il s’agit pour nous de renforcer notre positionnement sur les marchés. Qu’est-ce qui peut l’illustrer mieux que l’ouverture en octobre dernier de notre salle des marchés à New York ? Nous avons désormais une implantation fixe sur l’une des plus grandes places financières mondiales. Nous y gérons des portefeuilles en dollars et dollars canadiens. Nous avons déjà la réputation d’être de bons connaisseurs des marchés et nous allons développer cette compétence.  Deuxième axe : Être un acteur majeur de la stabilité financière La crise financière a mis en exergue le besoin d’un rôle accru des banques centrales et des superviseurs pour assurer la stabilité d’un système financier devenu global. Avec l’ACP et son adossement à la Banque de France, nous disposons d’une architecture de supervision solide, et d’une grande visibilité sur les éventuels  risques systémiques qui pourraient peser sur les systèmes financiers. Cette année, nous avons été extrêmement présents au plan national comme au sein des grands forums internationaux et nous avons souvent su convaincre de la pertinence de nos positions. Parce que notre système bancaire a été résilient, parce que notre mode de contrôle s’est révélé efficace et performant, nous avons pu faire entendre notre voix et peser sur les décisions. Il nous faut rester une force de proposition en matière de régulation et continuer à veiller au bon équilibre entre la nécessaire sécurité des systèmes et le financement de notre économie.  Trois objectifs stratégiques sont au service de cette ambition : 1) Contribuer au renforcement de la réglementation du système financier 2) Prévenir les risques systémiques 3). Asseoir le positionnement d’une Autorité de supervision, unifiée et forte, adossée à la Banque de France      Troisième axe : Contribuer au bon fonctionnement de l’économie La médiation du crédit, les missions étendues confiées aux commissions de surendettement, la réflexion sur la mise en place d’un fichier positif des crédits aux particuliers sont autant de marques de confiance dans l’expertise de la Banque et dans sa capacité à remplir avec réactivité de nouvelles missions au service des agents économiques. Nous devons évidemment être à la hauteur de cette confiance, qui se traduit par trois objectifs : 1) Affiner notre diagnostic sur l’économie et son financement : c’est l’expertise FIBEN et la cotation des entreprises ; c’est GEODE, c’est ACSEL. Il y a donc là des convergences, des synergies, des effets d’entraînement croisés qui nous donnent une force de frappe et une crédibilité sans équivalent. 2) Améliorer la protection des consommateurs de produits d’assurance, de banques et d’épargne : ce n’est pas une mission historique des banques centrales pourtant c’est aujourd’hui au cœur de nos préoccupations. Que ce soit à travers Infobanque et la plate-forme téléphonique étendue aux produits bancaires et d’assurance ou avec le contrôle des établissements et la surveillance des produits nouveaux, nous essayons de répondre à ce besoin nouveau et nous allons encore accroitre nos compétences et notre efficacité pour une meilleure protection des particuliers. 3) Renforcer la sécurité des moyens de paiement.Prenons l’exemple du  traitement du fiduciaire. La bonne circulation des billets et des pièces est une mission historique des banques centrales, elle demeure une composante essentielle du bon fonctionnement de notre économie. Là encore notre stratégie s’appuie sur toutes nos ressources : la création de nouveaux centres fiduciaires permettant des traitements industriels et un approvisionnement en toutes circonstances ; les contrôles que nous exerçons sur les acteurs de la filière qui réalisent du recyclage ; les actions de formation et d’information grand public que nous menons, à la Cité des sciences, lors des Journées du patrimoine ou encore via les supports de communication professionnelle des 80 0000 boulangers de France…Tout cela va dans le même sens : assurer la sécurité des moyens de paiement fiduciaires. Nos contributions sur tous ces volets sont donc cruciales.      Quatrième axe : Assurer notre indépendance financière La gestion rigoureuse de nos ressources, et notamment de la rente monétaire dont nous sommes dépositaires, est le meilleur gage de notre indépendance. Parce que nous sommes rigoureux, nous pouvons financer notre développement en toute indépendance, sans avoir à nous tourner vers l’actionnaire. C’est grâce à cela que nous sommes en mesure de consolider nos fonds propres et de provisionner nos engagements en matière de retraite, tout en apportant à notre actionnaire, un confortable dividende. Nous devons poursuivre dans cette voie, en assurant la meilleure allocation possible des ressources dont nous disposons. Trois objectifs y concourent : 1) Renforcer notre structure financière 2) Optimiser nos investissements 3) Offrir le meilleur service au meilleur coût. Je soulignerai ici simplement deux points pour indiquer comment nous devons y parvenir. D’abord avec le Comité des grands projets créé cette année, nous disposons désormais d’un outil pour éclairer les choix d’investissements, mais aussi vérifier tout au long du déroulement du projet, que le cahier des charges initial est respecté. C’est essentiel, car si devons réaliser les investissements nécessaires à nos ambitions, nous devons aussi nous assurer que les sommes investies le sont à bon escient. Le deuxième aspect vise tous les niveaux de l’entreprise. Nous devons, chacun dans notre domaine, faire nos meilleurs efforts pour produire les meilleurs services au moindre coût. Réduire nos dépenses, optimiser nos ressources tout en conservant une même qualité et une même implication dans le travail, tel est notre challenge au quotidien.   Les six facteurs clés de succès Tous ces objectifs dessinent un programme ambitieux. Réussir ce programme, atteindre cette ambition reposent largement sur la mobilisation de chacun. C’est pourquoi s’ajoute à ces objectifs opérationnels, un ensemble d’actions qui visent à faire évoluer nos manières de travailler, de vivre ensemble dans l’entreprise pour rendre l’atteinte de nos objectifs collectivement plus facile, et individuellement plus gratifiante.    Ces actions s’organisent autour de 6facteurs clés : 1) Favoriser le mieux être au travail 2) Renforcer l’adéquation des ressources humaines aux priorités stratégiques 3) Développer la transversalité 4) Développer la culture de la performance et de la maîtrise des risques 5) Développer un système d’information orienté clients internes 6) Atteindre nos objectifs environnementaux Quelques mots sur chacun d’entre eux. 1) Favoriser le mieux être au travail Depuis plusieurs années, la Banque s’applique à instaurer des conditions de travail propices à l’épanouissement professionnel de chacun, gage de performance individuelle et collective. Quelques exemples les plus récents : la charte de la parentalité, par laquelle nous nous engageons à mieux prendre en compte les contraintes familiales ; le label égalité, qui valide notre action continue en matière d’égalité hommes/femmes ; ou encore l’accord d’entreprise sur le télétravail qui va déboucher sur de toutes premières expériences. J’ajouterai, bien sûr, la démarche de prévention des risques psychosociaux qui témoigne de notre volonté d’associer toutes les parties prenantes à la construction d’un meilleur vivre-ensemble. Jean-Paul Redouin y reviendra largement dans la suite de l’après-midi. Ce que je souhaite affirmer fortement tout de suite, c’est que ces différentes démarches vont se poursuivre et que les programmes d’action que nous avons arrêtés seront mis en œuvre. 2) Renforcer l’adéquation des ressources humaines aux priorités stratégiques Chacun le sait, nous allons enregistrer dans les prochaines années des départs massifs. Relever tous nos défis, atteindre nos objectifs suppose donc que nous puissions assurer dans le temps, en quantité et en qualité, l’adéquation des nos ressources humaines aux besoins issus de notre stratégie. Cela passe par trois volets : - le recrutement d’agents disposant de compétences pointues dans tous nos domaines critiques ; - la formation en continu du personnel pour qu’il puisse non pas accompagner mais porter les changements techniques, organisationnels, comportementaux de l’entreprise ;   - l’organisation des transferts de savoir afin que le capital de connaissances et de professionnalisme des agents qui partiront ne soit pas perdu. Ce sont autant de politiques déjà engagées qui vont être approfondies. 3) Développer la transversalité Le mot peut sembler galvaudé ; il renvoie pourtant à un besoin crucial. Parce que nos activités interagissent les unes avec les autres ; parce que les problèmes posés sont complexes ; parce que trouver des solutions suppose de voir large en s’appuyant sur des points de vue croisés. Et, je tiens à le souligner, nous savons travailler ensemble. Nous l’avons prouvé dans tous les grands moments, du passage à l’euro à la résolution de la crise qui fait jouer simultanément études, opérations, contrôle prudentiel, et combine étroitement action du siège et action du réseau. Mais nous sommes sans doute moins bons au quotidien, lorsqu’il s’agit de partager de manière volontaire et systématique nos informations, nos connaissances, nos compétences, ou de chercher les savoirs là où ils sont. C’est pourtant ce vers quoi nous devons tendre. Et c’est pourquoi nous devons continuer à déployer les outils et la culture qui permettront à tous de s’informer, d’échanger et de mieux travailler ensemble jour après jour. 4) Développer la culture de la performance et de la maîtrise des risques C’est grâce à elle que nous pourrons garantir la qualité de gestion qui constitue notre quatrième axe stratégique. Cette double préoccupation doit bien sûr être intégrée par chacun, à son niveau de responsabilité. La mise en place de dispositifs de pilotage, le suivi des objectifs et une meilleure reconnaissance des contributions de chacun sont autant de voies pour y parvenir. 5) Développer un système d’information orienté clients internes Compte tenu de nos activités, le système d’information constitue la colonne vertébrale de notre action. Il supporte et soutient nos actions au quotidien, tout en conditionnant l’organisation de nos processus opérationnels. Il est donc indispensable qu’il se place au plus près des domaines pour leur permettre de mener à bien leurs projets stratégiques. 6) Atteindre nos objectifs environnementaux Nous sommes désormais engagés ici dans une démarche ambitieuse, qui s’inscrit dans le cadre du Grenelle de l’environnement. Le déploiement du Schéma de réduction de l’empreinte environnementale en est la traduction au sein de l’entreprise. Celui-ci s’appuie sur   des chantiers importants, notamment pour améliorer la performance énergétique des bâtiments. Pour réussir, il doit s’appuyer aussi sur l’évolution des comportements individuels pour économiser toutes les ressources naturelles : eau, énergie, etc. Cela devrait avoir d’autant plus de sens pour chaque agent que nous avons volontairement inscrit la réduction de nos consommations d’électricité et de gaz parmi les objectifs de l’accord triennal d’intéressement. Et c’est par toutes ces actions combinées que la Banque doit devenir exemplaire en matière environnementale.    Cette carte stratégique constitue donc notre feuille de route. Elle indique clairement là où nous voulons aller ; elle constitue un point de repère compréhensible par tous ; elle doit nous permettre de retrouver le bon chemin si nous nous égarons. Et c’est bien en s’appuyant sur elle que le Comité de direction vérifiera désormais deux fois par an le degré d’atteinte de nos objectifs. Ces réunions, dites de pilotage stratégique, nous permettront de mesurer le chemin parcouru et, en cas de dérive, de trouver les solutions pour revenir au plus près de la route que nous nous étions fixée. Je voudrais enfin souligner que ce nouveau mode de pilotage et de suivi se décline dans les domaines. En partant de la carte d’ensemble, les directeurs généraux ont établi celle de leur domaine ; et c’est elle qui servira de support au suivi de la stratégie du domaine. Avec cette nouvelle organisation, nous nous donnons donc les moyens de suivre le déploiement de notre stratégie ; nous franchissons un degré supplémentaire vers une gestion exemplaire ; et nous nous assurons que la Banque sera prête pour ses défis futurs.  n Les deux priorités 2011 Réussir la présidence française du G20 Notre première priorité pour 2011 est de réussir la présidence française du G20. Depuis le début de la crise financière, le G20 est devenu le nouvel organe central de décision en matière de gouvernance du système financier. Sa « filière finance » fait travailler de manière conjointe les ministres des finances et les gouverneurs de banques centrales. C’est là qu’ont été   débattues, avant leur mise en application par les régulateurs, les nouvelles règles de rémunération des opérateurs de marché, l’isolement des paradis fiscaux ou l’esquisse des nouvelles règles prudentielles dites de Bâle 3. Aujourd’hui nous travaillons principalement sur deux grands projets: le premier que nous appelons le « Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth » est un projet ambitieux qui vise à la coordination de  nos politiques économiques et le second a pour objectif une réforme le système monétaire international.  La présidence française du G20, qui a débuté il y a moins d’un mois, nous offre ainsi une opportunité unique pour guider les choix des thèmes de discussion et être force de proposition. En coordination avec les services de l’Élysée et du ministère des Finances, nous allons donc tout faire pour que les réformes se poursuivent afin de renforcer la résilience du système financier international. Notre responsabilité est donc historique. Jean-Pierre Landau y reviendra en détail tout à l’heure.  2e priorité : poursuivre la transformation de la Banque Au cours des années passées, notre institution a fait la preuve de sa capacité à se transformer pour répondre au mieux à l’évolution de son environnement et préparer son avenir. Nous devons poursuivre en ce sens, c'est-à-dire ajuster en permanence nos modes d’organisation, nos fonctionnements, nos outils, pour les rendre plus performants et accroitre la valeur ajoutée que nous délivrons à notre environnement. Ce souci d’efficacité et de rigueur, et singulièrement de rigueur budgétaire, n’est pas conjoncturel. C’est une exigence permanente. Mais la crise et l’effort général de la puissance publique pour maîtriser les déficits les rendent plus cruciaux encore : 2011 sera donc tout particulièrement placé sous le signe de la rigueur de gestion. Toutefois, rigueur ne veut pas dire renoncement. La Banque consent toujours aux investissements de long terme nécessaires. En 2010, plusieurs décisions d’investissement, pour des montants significatifs, ont été prises (exemples). En 2011, priorité sera donnée à la mise en œuvre de ces décisions (préciser). Un effort particulier sera donc porté sur le suivi et le pilotage des actions engagées.  n Conclusion    Médiation du crédit, organisation du G20, information du public via Internet ou téléphone, développement de T2S, réformes internes, ouverture d’une salle de marché ou changements d’outils applicatifs : quelque soit le domaine de compétence, quelque soit le public auquel elle s’adresse, la Banque est une institution en mouvement, en phase avec son temps. Notre capacité à réagir au plus fort de la crise est la meilleure preuve que nous ayons pu offrir de notre utilité au service de nos concitoyens. Nos contributions sur le plan français, européen ou international sont reconnues. C’est un motif de fierté dont nous pouvons tous nous enorgueillir. Cette réussite est celle de tous les agents, au premier rang desquels les managers que vous êtes. Je tiens à vous en remercier très chaleureusement. Et je sais que je peux compter sur vous pour poursuivre ce travail en profondeur et dans la durée. Je sais de la même manière pouvoir compter sur notre nouveau comité de direction. Vous le savez, c’est une équipe à la fois expérimentée et renouvelée qui assure désormais le pilotage opérationnel de notre action. Et c’est important, car aussi bien tracés soient nos missions fondamentales et nos axes stratégiques, ils doivent s’incarner dans des hommes et des femmes, qui les déclinent, les fassent vivre et leur donnent sens. Communiquer, expliquer, rattacher chaque élément du quotidien à notre carte stratégique, c’est en effet votre responsabilité vis-à-vis de l’entreprise et de vos agents. Je vous demande donc de relayer mon message auprès de vos collaborateurs, de faire preuve de la pédagogie nécessaire pour que nos priorités soient comprises et partagées, et de favoriser la mobilisation, l’implication et la reconnaissance du travail de chacun. Je vous remercie par avance. Car c’est la garantie de notre succès collectif ; et c’est l’assurance du bien-être au travail de chacun.  ","christian noyer"
"23","discours","11.04.2014","1    Conférence de l’ACPR sur le contrôle des pratiques  commerciales des acteurs financiers  Mardi 4 novembre 2014  Discours de Christian Noyer Gouverneur de la Banque de France et Président de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution   Mesdames, Messieurs,  Je suis très heureux de vous accueillir aujourd’hui pour cette nouvelle conférence de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution, et vous remercie de votre présence. Cette journée du 4 novembre 2014, qui marque par ailleurs la mise en place du Mécanisme de supervision unique (MSU) des banques de la zone euro, est pour moi une excellente occasion d’approfondir nos échanges sur des missions qui continuent de relever intégralement de l’ACPR, comme le contrôle des pratiques commerciales en assurance et en banque, thème de la matinée, et les services de paiement et de monnaie électronique, thème de l’après-midi. La protection de la clientèle et le contrôle des pratiques commerciales des acteurs financiers sont désormais devenus des sujets incontournables, aux plans national, européen et international. Permettez-moi de m’y attarder un peu. Les réflexions aux niveaux mondial et européen auront un impact très concret sur la réglementation nationale dans les années à venir, et par là-même sur l’ACPR. Le prochain sommet du G20 devrait présenter les travaux finalisés de l’OCDE sur les 10 principes de protection des consommateurs de produits financiers qui ont vocation à être 2  introduits dans les règlementations des États-membres. Ces principes déclinent la notion de comportement responsable des professionnels et de leurs intermédiaires.  Au niveau européen, les règlementations sont en train de modifier sensiblement le paysage normatif bancaire et assurantiel français traditionnel. Ces changements se feront d’autant plus rapidement qu’ils s’accompagnent d’une évolution notable du mode de production des normes européennes, avec une montée en puissance des actes délégués et des lignes directrices édictés directement par les Autorités européennes de supervision. Ces règlementations et lignes directrices sur la commercialisation sont de plus en plus souvent d’application trans-sectorielle, avec un objectif d’harmonisation des obligations entre les secteurs de la banque, de l’assurance et des instruments financiers. Issus de la directive MIF relative aux marchés des instruments financiers, de nombreux concepts comme la gestion des conflits d’intérêt, l’obligation d’agir au mieux des intérêts du client ou la transparence des rémunérations des distributeurs, servent de référence pour les discussions en cours sur la distribution des produits d’assurance et du crédit.  Ces réglementations et lignes directrices tendent à objectiver les exigences mises à la charge des professionnels : quel contenu pour l’information précontractuelle ? Quelle matérialisation du conseil ? Comment s’assurer de la solvabilité d’un emprunteur, à partir de quels éléments ? Qu’est-ce qu’un conflit d’intérêt et comment le gérer en pratique ? Les réponses apportées à ces questions ont toutes une incidence directe sur l’organisation des établissements et de leurs intermédiaires. Je voudrais illustrer mon propos en évoquant trois thèmes communs aux 3 secteurs liés à l’environnement de la vente et actuellement traités dans différents groupes de travail européens : le conseil, la rémunération des conseillers et le processus de mise sur le marché des produits financiers. Ces trois sujets représentent une opportunité de faire évoluer les pratiques vers une meilleure protection des clients. Il s’agit, d’une part, d’éviter des situations structurelles de conflit d’intérêts entre un conseiller et un client. Il s’agit , d’autre part, d’accompagner l’innovation financière afin qu’elle réponde aux attentes des clients sans leur être préjudiciable. En matière de conseil, la tendance européenne est de distinguer un service de conseil autonome de l’acte de vente lui-même, et payé en tant que tel par le client. Ce schéma, très éloigné de la conception française en banque et en assurance, pourrait présenter une régression dans le domaine de la protection de la clientèle. L’ACPR, favorable au maintien du conseil intégré à la vente, veille à maintenir un socle d’exigences non-détachables du produit lui-même afin d’éviter la généralisation de ventes non conseillées.  3  En ce qui concerne la rémunération, les marchés financiers se sont dotés les premiers d’un dispositif encadrant les politiques et les pratiques de rémunération. Ce dispositif traite à la fois de la rémunération des collaborateurs salariés en relation avec la clientèle et du commissionnement des intermédiaires. Le secteur de la banque et de l’assurance suit désormais cette tendance. La rémunération est un élément important qui ne doit pas remettre en cause la neutralité du conseil donné. Si un encadrement semble nécessaire, ne serait-ce que pour écarter les situations de conflit d’intérêt, il ne doit toutefois pas avoir pour effet de créer des arbitrages artificiels entre les différents modes de distribution. En matière de décision de mise sur le marché d’un produit financier, la notion de gouvernance des produits est relativement nouvelle sur la scène européenne. Elle vise à mettre en place, en amont de la commercialisation des produits, des dispositifs de protection de la clientèle qui reposent sur les producteurs. Encadrer la « gouvernance du produit » vise à responsabiliser davantage les producteurs vis-à-vis des clients sur les produits qu’ils lancent sur le marché. Plus particulièrement, il s’agit de réserver à une clientèle préalablement ciblée les produits considérés. C’est la réponse européenne à la vente non conseillée. Ce nouveau dispositif ne doit toutefois pas être construit en opposition au conseil. Une articulation intelligente peut être organisée entre les deux approches, l’une comme l’autre protectrice de la clientèle, afin de les rendre complémentaires.  Ces trois sujets attestent du progrès rapide des réflexions européennes en matière de protection de la clientèle et constitueront bientôt un nouveau défi pour l’ACPR qui devra faire appliquer tous ces nouveaux concepts. Un autre défi pour l’ACPR proviendra des nouveaux canaux et modes de distribution dans le secteur financier. Là aussi, le paysage évolue. Principalement en raison de nouveaux modes de « consommation » au sens large et de l'application généralisée des nouvelles technologies à la vie quotidienne. L'ACPR le constate déjà dans ses contrôles : les canaux de commercialisation se multiplient en termes d’acteurs, qu’ils soient intermédiaires en assurance ou en banque, courtiers, grossistes ou mandataires, plateformes, comparateurs, sans oublier les multiples acteurs de l'industrie des paiements.  La récente ordonnance du 30 mai 2014 relative au financement participatif a ainsi introduit de nouveaux acteurs habilités à financer des projets sous certaines conditions, par exception 4  au monopole bancaire, via des plateformes de prêts ou de dons, avec le nouveau statut des intermédiaires en financement participatif.  Ces différents acteurs modifient ou modifieront le marché : quels en seront les enjeux commerciaux ? Et avec quelle responsabilité vis-à-vis des clients ? Pour quelle articulation entre ces nouveaux distributeurs, et avec les producteurs ?  Ces canaux se modifient aussi au plan technique : la banque numérique, la vente à distance, les nouvelles modalités de paiement, et plus généralement l'usage des données des clients dans l'univers de l'intelligence artificielle et ses applications multiples pour proposer des solutions aux clients.  Ces évolutions doivent intégrer – et non remettre en question – le principe sur lequel est bâtie la réglementation européenne, celui d’une relation singulière entre un professionnel du secteur financier et un client – en principe moins technicien, moins informé. C’est là le second défi de l’ACPR : veiller à ce que ces nouveaux canaux et modalités de distribution respectent les règles de protection de la clientèle. Dans cet environnement en évolution permanente, l’ACPR dispose d’une panoplie complète d’instruments pour remplir sa mission de protection de la clientèle. Depuis sa mise en place en mars 2010, l’ACPR a développé des méthodologies de contrôle des pratiques commerciales et des moyens conséquents pour assurer sa mission de protection de la clientèle des établissements bancaires, des organismes d’assurance et des intermédiaires financiers. En premier lieu, les contrôles sur pièces et sur place sont destinés à vérifier la conformité et le respect des règles applicables, et à faire corriger les erreurs avant qu'elles n'aient des conséquences dommageables pour les clients.  Face à des manquements graves aux obligations légales et réglementaires et aux conséquences significatives pour les clients, des sanctions peuvent être prononcées. Cette approche répressive est légitime ; elle est nécessaire pour sanctionner les manquements passés. Et la Commission des sanctions de l’ACPR ne manque pas, quand il le faut, de sanctionner. Elle l’a d’ailleurs fait récemment lorsqu’elle a constaté une application défaillante des modalités du droit au compte, élément substantiel de l’inclusion bancaire de clientèles fragiles sur lequel les établissements se sont fortement engagés. Elle l’a fait également lorsqu’elle a constaté que les exigences désormais anciennes du devoir de conseil en assurance n’étaient toujours pas respectées. Elle l’a fait enfin, tout récemment, en assurance-vie, lorsqu’elle a constaté que le dispositif d’identification des assurés décédés, 5  de recherche des bénéficiaires et de paiement des capitaux aux clients assurés ou bénéficiaires n’était pas correctement mis en œuvre.  Si les sanctions sont aussi utiles pour leur valeur d’exemple, elles ne doivent pas éclipser l’ensemble des autres outils et instruments, davantage tournés vers la prévention, dont dispose l’ACPR. S’agissant du droit souple, le pouvoir d’émettre des recommandations a été expressément conféré à l’ACPR par le législateur pour tirer parti de l'observation des bonnes et mauvaises pratiques et ainsi orienter le marché. À visée très opérationnelle, les recommandations de l’ACPR aident la profession à identifier et prendre en compte de manière plus concrète ce qui est attendu dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre de la règlementation protectrice de la clientèle. Ayant pour objet de modifier ou d’orienter les comportements des professionnels, elles forment un instrument préventif très utile et complémentaire à l’approche répressive. Enfin, la communication, la pédagogie, le dialogue, notamment avec les professionnels, constituent un élément déterminant de la politique de supervision auquel l’ACPR est très attachée – et la présente conférence en est l'un des moments forts.  Je profite justement de cette conférence pour rappeler la vigilance particulière de l’ACPR sur le niveau des taux de revalorisation qui seront servis aux assurés au titre de 2014. Les taux d’intérêt sur les marchés obligataires, sur lesquels les assureurs sont très largement présents, suivent une tendance baissière depuis plusieurs années et cet environnement de taux bas pourrait se maintenir pendant encore de nombreuses années. Les assureurs doivent s’adapter au contexte actuel en s’appuyant sur un rendement adapté des contrats d’assurance. Cela peut notamment passer par un lissage dans le temps de la distribution des résultats aux assurés, en dotant la provision pour participation aux bénéfices à un niveau suffisamment élevé. Par le passé, une bonne gestion des taux de revalorisation et des provisions a permis aux assureurs français de traverser plusieurs crises bien mieux que d’autres. Mettre en question la sécurité du marché, en prenant des décisions imprudentes de revalorisation au détriment des réserves, diminuerait la capacité de résilience de certains acteurs en cas de crise. C’est pourquoi l’ensemble des acteurs du marché de l’assurance concernés doit pratiquer une revalorisation des contrats adaptée tant à la performance réelle de leurs actifs qu’aux caractéristiques de leurs engagements au passif.  Je laisse maintenant la parole à Fabrice Pesin et aux équipes de l’ACPR pour revenir sur certains des aspects que j’ai brièvement évoqués et vous souhaite une excellente conférence.

"24","discours","22.10.2014"," 1  « Vers des paiements de détail 2.0 : les nouveaux défis pour la sécurité » Paris, le 22 octobre 2014 Discours d’ouverture de Christian Noyer Gouverneur de la Banque de France Mesdames, Messieurs, C’est pour moi un grand plaisir d’inaugurer aujourd’hui cette conférence consacrée aux travaux du forum SecuRe Pay et aux nouveaux défis en matière de sécurité qui devront être relevés pour les paiements de détail. Au nom de la Banque centrale européenne et de la Banque de France, je vous souhaite à tous la bienvenue à Paris et je vous remercie d’avoir accepté notre invitation à participer à cet événement. Toutes les autorités ayant un intérêt dans le domaine de la sécurité au plan national et européen sont représentées aujourd’hui, ainsi que les principaux acteurs du secteur privé. Je suis convaincu que cela va susciter des débats fructueux et fournir une vue d’ensemble exhaustive des principaux défis et problématiques concernant la sécurité des moyens de paiement de détail.  L’organisation de cette conférence ici à Paris illustre l’appui ininterrompu que la Banque de France a apporté au forum SecuRe Pay depuis le tout début, afin de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail en Europe.  Ce soutien trouve son origine dans la mission de la Banque de France qui, depuis 2001, nous impose explicitement de garantir la sécurité des paiements scripturaux. Cela a contribué à nourrir une longue expérience dans le traitement des questions de sécurité et d’efficience, ainsi que des arbitrages du point de vue des politiques publiques, expérience à laquelle je voudrais me référer afin de tirer quelques enseignements susceptibles de retenir votre attention dans le cadre des débats auxquels vous allez participer aujourd’hui.  2  Au cours des dix dernières années, le secteur financier a connu une profonde mutation avec l’apparition d’internet et l’utilisation des nouvelles technologies de l’information. C’est particulièrement vrai en ce qui concerne les moyens de paiement. L’introduction des cartes à puce dotées d’un code confidentiel en France au début des années quatre-vingt-dix, puis partout en Europe ces dernières années, constitue un excellent exemple de la manière dont l’innovation peut être la source d’avantages en termes d’efficacité mais aussi de sécurité pour la chaîne de paiement. Cette introduction a effectivement contribué à rendre très sûrs les paiements par carte au point de vente.  Toutefois, les innovations se sont également accompagnées de nouveaux défis en termes de gestion des risques. C’est notamment le cas avec le développement des paiements à distance qui peuvent être effectués sur internet. Comme le souligne le rapport sur la fraude relative aux paiements par carte publié par la BCE en février 2014, la fraude résultant des paiements à distance, principalement sur internet, a augmenté de près de 21 % en 2012 dans l’espace SEPA, et représentait 60 % de l’ensemble des pertes dues à des fraudes avec des cartes mises en circulation dans l’espace SEPA.  Heureusement, les vulnérabilités à l’origine de ces fraudes sont bien identifiées et des efforts importants ont été entrepris tant par les autorités publiques que par le secteur privé pour y remédier. En France, une contribution importante est apportée par l’Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de paiement, que j’ai l’honneur de présider. Ses recommandations ont favorisé la reconnaissance par les parties prenantes, qui sont toutes représentées à l’Observatoire, de l’importance d’une authentification rigoureuse du client pour les paiements sur internet et ont facilité sa large adoption. Il a nettement contribué à limiter l’incidence sur les taux de fraude, au moins pour les paiements nationaux, et a favorisé la spectaculaire expansion du commerce électronique à laquelle nous assistons actuellement.  Mais au-delà du développement des paiements par carte sur internet, d’autres innovations comme les paiements sans contact et par téléphone mobile ou les services de banque en ligne soulèvent aussi des questions importantes. Parmi ces questions figure notamment la protection des données de paiement sensibles. Pour y répondre, la Banque de France a travaillé avec la communauté bancaire, ce qui a abouti à la conclusion d’un accord en 2011 afin de promouvoir la protection des identifiants de comptes bancaires et des numéros de cartes. La question de la protection des données sensibles apparaît d’autant plus importante que nous observons l’arrivée de nouveaux acteurs dans la chaîne de paiement, comme les tiers fournisseurs de services de paiement, susceptibles d’apporter une contribution positive stimulant l’innovation et la concurrence potentielle sur le marché des paiements de détail, mais dont le mode de fonctionnement ne doit pas abaisser le niveau de sécurité actuel des services de banque en ligne.   3 Quelles leçons pouvons-nous tirer de cette expérience afin de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail à plus grande échelle ? J’aimerais souligner trois de ces enseignements, qui pourraient présenter un intérêt pour le débat d’aujourd’hui : Premièrement, l’adoption par les consommateurs de solutions de paiement innovantes sera d’autant plus large et durable que ces solutions seront sûres et il est dans l’intérêt des innovateurs d’accorder suffisamment d’attention aux questions de sécurité. Deuxièmement, le dialogue et la coopération entre les différents acteurs en matière de sécurité des paiements sont indispensables pour obtenir des résultats robustes. Des forums tels que l’Observatoire de la sécurité des cartes de paiement en France, qui regroupe des commerçants, des consommateurs, des acteurs du secteur bancaire et du marché des paiements, mais aussi des représentants du Parlement français et d’autres autorités publiques compétentes, peuvent se révéler très utiles de ce point de vue. Dans ce type de forums, les autorités ont à jouer un rôle important de catalyseur pour faciliter le consensus entre les intervenants, surmonter les problèmes techniques et adopter des exigences garantissant le plus haut niveau de sécurité des paiements de détail, tout en encourageant l’innovation et l’efficience. Enfin, la coopération et la coordination entre les autorités publiques exerçant des responsabilités dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements doivent intégrer une dimension européenne et internationale pour être pleinement efficaces. C’est une conséquence directe de l’interdépendance des questions de sécurité au plan européen et même mondial. Je me réjouis de constater qu’au niveau européen, la création du forum Secure Pay, en 2011, a suivi cette voie en renforçant la coopération entre les banques centrales et les autorités prudentielles de l’Union européenne et de l’Espace économique européen dans le domaine de la sécurité des paiements de détail. Cette coopération au sein de Secure Pay a déjà donné d’importants résultats : deux ensembles de recommandations ont été émis jusqu’à présent, concernant la sécurité des paiements sur internet en 2013, avec une mise en œuvre par le marché prévue avant février 2015, et la sécurité des paiements par téléphone mobile en 2014, pour laquelle les recommandations sont en cours de finalisation. Le texte définitif des recommandations relatives à la sécurité des services d’accès aux comptes de paiement a également été publié, à titre d’information, en mai 2014, en étroite collaboration avec l’Autorité Bancaire Européenne (ABE), à la lumière de la révision en cours de la directive sur les services de paiement. La prise en compte par le législateur européen d’une grande partie des recommandations émises par le forum Secure Pay pour la révision de la directive sur les services de paiement constitue, à mon sens, une preuve de la qualité des travaux menés par le forum. Je salue en particulier l’intégration d’une authentification rigoureuse du client dans le texte révisé de la directive, ce qui constitue clairement un progrès  majeur en matière de sécurité des paiements de détail. Secure Pay a récemment connu un profond changement de gouvernance et sera à l’avenir présidé conjointement par l’Autorité bancaire européenne et la Banque centrale européenne. Cette évolution  4 devrait encore renforcer la coopération entre les institutions de surveillance et de supervision et faciliter la mise en œuvre des recommandations. En conclusion - et je m’arrêterai là – je souhaiterais souligner combien cette conférence est en prise avec l’actualité. La proposition de directive révisée sur les services de paiement étant actuellement examinée par le Conseil de l’Union européenne, une opportunité unique est aujourd’hui donnée à tous les acteurs de s’attaquer aux différentes questions soulevées par la nouvelle réglementation en présence de représentants de l’ensemble des autorités européennes compétentes impliquées. Encore une fois, je vous remercie tous de votre présence et je vous souhaite des discussions fructueuses et animées sur l’ensemble de ces aspects, dans l’espoir que cette conférence vous donnera une vision complète des nouveaux défis que soulève la sécurité des paiements de détail. Avant de céder la parole à notre premier groupe d’experts, je vous invite à écouter Benoît Cœuré, membre du Directoire de la Banque centrale européenne, qui ne peut être présent physiquement avec nous aujourd’hui, mais qui a enregistré ses commentaires pour nous. Je vous remercie de votre attention. ","christian noyer"
"25","discours","25.11.2014"," 1   Forum financier Paris Europlace  Tokyo, 25 novembre 2014  Le pouvoir de la politique monétaire Christian Noyer, Gouverneur de la Banque de France  Il y a deux semaines, j’ai eu le privilège de présider à Paris le symposium triennal de la Banque de France. Le gouverneur Kuroda nous a fait le grand honneur d’y participer. Lors de ce symposium, l’un des intervenants a déclaré que, durant la crise financière, les banques centrales de la plupart des pays avaient été (je cite) le seul acteur possible ou, comme le disent les Anglais,« the only game in town » (fin de citation). Et il s’est demandé si tel serait toujours le cas dans le futur. Cette observation résume l’essence même des remarques que je formulerai aujourd’hui. Je souhaiterais parler du pouvoir de la politique monétaire dans le contexte actuel de faible inflation.   Les banques centrales ont répondu à la plus grande crise financière des soixante-dix dernières années par une action puissante et décisive. Et elles ont réussi à éviter une récession prolongée ainsi que l’effondrement de notre système financier. Aujourd’hui, toutefois, le défi auquel elles sont confrontées est différent. La croissance a été décevante dans de nombreuses parties du monde, et les prévisions ont été constamment revues à la baisse. Plus préoccupant encore pour les banques centrales, l’inflation s’est maintenue de façon persistante en deçà de notre définition de la stabilité des prix. Dans la zone euro, elle est passée, en rythme annuel, de 2,5% en 2012 à 0,3% en septembre dernier. Ce recul de l’inflation s’est produit en dépit des conditions monétaires les plus accommodantes jamais observées en Europe. On peut donc se demander si la politique monétaire aura autant de succès dans l’après-crise que durant la crise, et si elle réussira à éviter les dangers d’une inflation durablement faible.   Je centrerai mes remarques sur la zone euro, en profitant de l’organisation du forum à Tokyo pour tirer quelques leçons de l’expérience japonaise et surtout, devrais-je dire en saluant la présence du vice-gouverneur, M. Nakaso, de la grande expertise de la Banque du Japon.   2  On peut douter du pouvoir de la politique monétaire et ce, pour deux raisons. Le mécanisme de transmission peut être perturbé, et le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre peut être si bas (voire négatif) qu’il devient impossible à atteindre.   Le premier point parle de lui–même. La zone euro a souffert d’une très forte segmentation et d’un grave dysfonctionnement de ses marchés monétaire et du crédit, auquel il a été remédié de manière agressive, à l’aide d’un ensemble de mesures que je présenterai en détail dans quelques instants. Les résultats ont été significatifs. Les soldes Target 2 ont été réduits de moitié, ce qui signifie que les banques de la zone euro ne recourent plus dans la même mesure au réseau de banques centrales pour l’intermédiation de leurs opérations. Nous avons à présent achevé avec succès et crédibilité notre premier examen de la qualité des actifs au sein de notre système bancaire, et le nouveau Mécanisme de surveillance unique est devenu opérationnel la semaine dernière. Ces mesures seront essentielles pour rétablir le bon fonctionnement du canal du crédit et éliminer les différences qui subsistent au sein de la zone euro du point de vue des conditions financières.   J’en arrive à présent au second point : le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre et son importance pour la politique monétaire.   Ce concept est bien connu des économistes depuis le grand Knut Wicksell. Le taux d’intérêt « naturel » ou d’équilibre est exprimé en termes réels. C’est le taux auquel épargne et investissement s’équilibrent en situation de plein emploi et de stabilité des prix. Il constitue une référence centrale pour évaluer l’orientation monétaire. Par exemple, si le taux du marché est supérieur au taux d’équilibre, cela correspond à un excès d’épargne et à une insuffisance de la consommation et de l’investissement. En conséquence, l’inflation diminue.   Le taux d’intérêt d’équilibre n’est pas stable. Il a nettement baissé depuis le début de la crise financière, devenant peut–être négatif. Pour maintenir la stabilité des prix et éviter une inflation durablement faible, il faut que les taux du marché diminuent également. En temps normal, cela peut être réalisé en abaissant le taux directeur, ce qui se répercute sur la courbe des rendements. Toutefois, lorsque les taux directeurs atteignent ce qu’on appelle la borne zéro, cette approche « conventionnelle » de la politique monétaire n’est plus une option. Pour éviter un resserrement involontaire de la politique monétaire, les banques centrales doivent recourir à des mesures non conventionnelles. Comme je vous l’exposerai dans un instant, une large gamme d’instruments non conventionnels a été mise en œuvre dans la zone euro.   3  Le bas niveau des taux d’intérêt d’équilibre peut être temporaire ou permanent. À vrai dire, nous n’avons aucune certitude à cet égard. Nous savons cependant qu’un très faible niveau d’inflation, si on le laisse persister, ne peut qu’aggraver la situation, car, toutes choses égales par ailleurs, une faible inflation accroît le taux d’intérêt réel. À leur tour, des taux d’intérêt réels élevés ont tendance à freiner l’activité économique et à faire baisser l’inflation encore davantage. C’est le type de spirale susceptible de mener à la déflation que la politique monétaire doit chercher à contrôler et à éviter.  Ce processus peut même s’auto-entretenir encore davantage s’il exerce une incidence négative sur les anticipations d’inflation. Au cours des derniers mois, les anticipations d’inflation dans la zone euro se sont réduites à 1,2% à un horizon d’un an et à 1,5% à un horizon de deux ans. Plus inquiétant, les anticipations à long terme – jusqu’à présent extrêmement bien ancrées autour de 2% – sont orientées à la baisse. Les marchés tablent actuellement sur un taux d’inflation de 1,8% en moyenne entre 2019 et 2024 dans la zone euro.   La politique monétaire doit donc chercher à influencer à la fois les taux d’intérêt nominaux et les anticipations d’inflation. C’est exactement ce que nous faisons actuellement dans l’Eurosystème, et je vais expliquer comment.  Considérons tout d’abord les taux d’intérêt nominaux.   Les taux directeurs sont aujourd’hui proches de zéro. Des taux d’intérêt négatifs sont appliqués à la facilité de dépôt. Nous avons eu recours à des indications prospectives (forward guidance) pour annoncer que les taux resteront à ces niveaux sur une très longue période. Une nouvelle facilité de liquidité, les opérations de refinancement à plus long terme ciblées (TLTRO), a été créée, avec une échéance de quatre ans et, pour la première fois, un taux fixe garanti. En substance, les banques peuvent obtenir un financement d’une durée de quatre ans à un taux d’intérêt fixe de 0,15%. Plus récemment, le Conseil des gouverneurs de la BCE a adopté un programme d’achat d’actifs privés, couvrant à la fois des obligations sécurisées et des titres adossés à des actifs (ABS). Ces acquisitions auront deux effets positifs sur les taux d’intérêt et le crédit : elles vont encore assouplir les conditions de financement des banques ; et elles vont faire baisser les primes de risque sur les actifs privés.  Ces mesures ont été extrêmement efficaces. Notre taux interbancaire au jour le jour, l’Eonia, s’est durablement installé en territoire négatif. La courbe des rendements s’est déplacée vers le bas, tant sur la  4 partie courte que sur la partie longue. Les écarts de rendement des emprunts souverains ont baissé : le taux de la dette émise aujourd’hui par l’Espagne est inférieur à celui de la dette émise par les États–Unis. Les anticipations relatives au taux au jour le jour futur (le taux OIS) ont un profil plat et sont proches de zéro pour les trois années à venir.   Ainsi, notre action sur les taux d’intérêt nominaux a été forte et efficace. Qu’en est-il des anticipations d’inflation ?  Il serait très dangereux, dans la situation actuelle, que la banque centrale soit perçue comme plus tolérante envers une inflation faible qu’à l’égard d’une inflation trop élevée. Une telle approche asymétrique de la stabilité des prix « validerait » les anticipations de baisse de l’inflation. Et l’économie s’installerait durablement dans un équilibre d’inflation faible où tout choc négatif la ferait basculer dans la déflation pure et simple.  Afin de nous prémunir contre une telle interprétation erronée, notre Conseil des gouverneurs a affirmé unanimement son engagement à recourir à des instruments non conventionnels supplémentaires dans le cadre de son mandat, s’il devenait nécessaire de lutter contre une inflation durablement faible.   L’Eurosystème a également commencé à communiquer sur la taille de son bilan, sujet qui a suscité beaucoup d’intérêt récemment. Le Conseil des gouverneurs a indiqué qu’il s’attendait à présent à ce que ce bilan retrouve les dimensions qu’il affichait au début de l’année 2012, soit une augmentation de 1 000 milliards d'euros environ. La question de savoir si la taille du bilan d’une banque centrale est un paramètre pertinent et, surtout, si elle a une incidence sur les anticipations d’inflation, fait l’objet de nombreux débats parmi les économistes et les acteurs de marché. Permettez-moi de vous donner mon point de vue sur ce sujet.  La déclaration du Conseil des gouverneurs n’est pas formulée comme un engagement ferme mais comme une prévision. Elle est néanmoins très significative. Il est certain qu'elle doit être considérée comme une indication claire que si de nouvelles mesures doivent être prises à l’avenir, elles ne seront pas entravées par une restriction ou une limite quantitative globale. C’est d’autant plus important que le bilan de l’Eurosystème va augmenter alors que ceux des autres banques centrales sont amenés à se contracter. La communication sur la taille du bilan donne un signal très concret et des informations quant à l’orientation future de la politique monétaire. Dès lors, elle ne peut que contribuer à ramener les anticipations à des niveaux plus conformes à notre définition de la stabilité des prix.   5  Je terminerai par deux remarques sur le lien entre la politique monétaire et les autres politiques.  Premièrement, lorsque l’inflation est faible, le fait que les salaires nominaux soient rigides ou flexibles a son importance. Le Japon bénéficie d’une grande flexibilité des salaires, une situation qui est favorable à la compétitivité mais qui peut accroître la vulnérabilité de l’économie aux pressions déflationnistes. En revanche, en Europe, et en particulier en France, les salaires nominaux sont relativement rigides et continuent d’enregistrer, même dans le contexte actuel, une croissance soutenue, de 1,1 % en rythme annuel. Même si cela peut avoir une incidence négative sur les bénéfices et la compétitivité, cela constitue actuellement un amortisseur et une protection contre un risque de déflation.  Deuxièmement – s’agissant de la politique budgétaire – si, comme l’a dit Milton Friedman dans sa célèbre phrase, « l’inflation est partout et toujours un phénomène monétaire », les banques centrales devraient être à même de la contrôler quelles que soient les circonstances. Je crois que cela est fondamentalement vrai. L’expérience récente a montré, toutefois, que la politique monétaire est plus efficace lorsqu'elle est mise en œuvre dans un environnement favorable, notamment s’agissant de la politique budgétaire. Cela est souvent présenté comme un argument en faveur d’une « coopération » entre les autorités budgétaires et monétaires. Je ne suis pas totalement d’accord avec ce concept, dans la mesure où je ne vois pas comment il peut être compatible avec l’indépendance de la banque centrale. Toutefois, il ne fait aucun doute que les politiques budgétaires et monétaires interagissent, de façon plus ou moins harmonieuse. Après la crise, des inquiétudes ont été exprimées quant au risque de « prépondérance budgétaire », les banques centrales s’étant engagées dans des achats d’obligations d’État de grande ampleur.  Le problème est différent dans le contexte actuel de faible inflation. En fonction de la manière dont elles sont conduites, les politiques budgétaires peuvent soit accroître, soit réduire l'incertitude économique globale. Une plus grande incertitude signifie davantage d'épargne et même des taux d'intérêt d’équilibre plus bas. Par le biais de ce canal, les politiques budgétaires ont la capacité de compliquer la conduite des politiques monétaires ou, au contraire, de la faciliter.  Ce constat se vérifie tout particulièrement dans la zone euro, où la politique monétaire unique interagit avec dix-huit (bientôt dix-neuf) politiques budgétaires nationales. Des règles d’encadrement sont en place afin de réduire l'incertitude liée à cette interaction. Le fait qu’elles seront, ou non, correctement mises en application sera déterminant pour notre capacité à revenir rapidement à une situation de stabilité des prix selon notre définition.
