{"RECORD_ID": 161, "AUTHOR": "Yves Mersch", "TITLE": "Interview with Börsen-Zeitung", "DATE": "2015-04-08", "TEXT": "BEGIN_QUESTION Mr Mersch, the start of the ECB’s public sector purchase programme has made a deep impression on the financial markets: the stock markets are up, the euro is sharply down and the returns on euro government bonds have clearly fallen again. How surprised are you by the strength of the impact of quantitative easing (QE)? END_QUESTION\n\nIt’s true, long-term interest rates have fallen further, in some cases to all-time lows. All in all, the financing conditions for the economy have improved. There are also signs that we will soon be moving into positive territory again in terms of lending. It would perhaps be somewhat bold to claim that the better mood in the economy is solely due to QE. But it is clear that QE is having a signalling effect and this channel is working very successfully.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONIt’s true, long-term interest rates have fallen further, in some cases to all-time lows.

It would perhaps be somewhat bold to claim that the better mood in the economy is solely due to QE. But it is clear that QE is having a signalling effect and this channel is working very successfully.END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION But aren’t such reports about the successful effect of QE on the real economy somewhat premature? Previously, even the ECB used to say that monetary policy measures take 12-18 months to have an effect. END_QUESTION\n\nYes, but monetary policy also works via the signalling channel and in this case it works very effectively and quickly. Now we have to wait and see how the other channels work. However, the decision on QE certainly came at the right time. \n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONYes, but monetary policy also works via the signalling channel and in this case it works very effectively and quickly. Now we have to wait and see how the other channels work. However, the decision on QE certainly came at the right time. END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION Because the economy of the euro area was at a turning point, not least because of cheaper oil? END_QUESTION\n\nAt the beginning of the year we had weakly positive signs. With QE, this development has strengthened.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONAt the beginning of the year we had weakly positive signs. With QE, this development has strengthened.END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION But isn’t there also a danger of “overdosing”? END_QUESTION\n\nThe Governing Council will carefully monitor the situation every month. We have now adopted a plan that we intend to follow up on: we are making purchases to the tune of €60 billion every month until September 2016. This forms the basis for our March projections, which envisage a slow return to an inflation rate that is close to our understanding of stable prices: accordingly, we shall be at 1.8% in 2017. However, if we see that we are going beyond that figure, it would of course be appropriate to consider whether we need to adjust our plan.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONThe Governing Council will carefully monitor the situation every month.

END_QUESTION\n\nLet me say again: we have specified a course of action and we’ll be sticking to it. If we see that it is bringing us more quickly to our goal, we are of course not so tied to our decisions that we could not adjust our course of action. Incidentally, that also applies should we do not come close to the target. We cannot in either instance turn our eyes from reality. \n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONLet me say again: we have specified a course of action and we’ll be sticking to it.

Incidentally, that also applies should we do not come close to the target. We cannot in either instance turn our eyes from reality. END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION Some market participants are claiming that the ECB is putting its credibility at risk in the case of a reduction [of the purchases]. But wouldn’t it also be a problem if the forecast were to rise above 2% and you were to continue with QE and not react? END_QUESTION\n\nWhat you are mentioning plays into the discussion on price-level targeting...\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONWhat you are mentioning plays into the discussion on price-level targeting...END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION ...in which a central bank specifies a certain price development which it has to achieve every year. If it doesn’t manage it, the bank has to steer towards it all the more resolutely in the following year. END_QUESTION\n\nThe proponents argue that we should declare this to be a new strategy. But in my view, that would be the wrong approach: it would be a fundamental change in an environment in which steadfastness and anchoring a proven strategy are very important. Moreover, in theory and under certain conditions this approach may be clever, but in practice, it is a highly questionable experiment. \n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONThe proponents argue that we should declare this to be a new strategy.

Moreover, in theory and under certain conditions this approach may be clever, but in practice, it is a highly questionable experiment. END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION So you don’t believe in allowing temporarily higher inflation in future, because inflation was significantly below the 2% target in recent years? END_QUESTION\n\nI don’t find this approach at all convincing. Such a change in our strategy would, in my eyes, be incompatible with stability. The Governing Council’s decision refers to “…a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONI don’t find this approach at all convincing.

But is that really so dangerous if it is due to falling oil prices? END_QUESTION\n\nI also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation, which is mainly attributable to temporary phenomena such as the price of oil, and on which we can effectively have no influence, and a general fall in the price level. Before January, however, the proportion of goods for which the rate of increase was less than 0.5% was steadily rising. Also, inflation expectations slumped from 1.8% to 1.4%. These were the arguments that persuaded me to recognise that we had to turn to the final resort.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONI also distinguish between an undershooting of zero inflation, which is mainly attributable to temporary phenomena such as the price of oil, and on which we can effectively have no influence, and a general fall in the price level.

END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION Sometimes one has the feeling of being a “topsy-turvy world”: the Fed, which has traditionally been very worried about deflation, is relatively relaxed in view of the oil-price-depressed inflation. The ECB, however, which has always warned against exaggerated fears of deflation is very alarmed. How come? END_QUESTION\n\nAs far as I can remember, we have never been in a situation where things have turned negative so quickly. I would not say that in January we were already at a point where consumers postpone their purchases in the expectation of falling prices. But the danger was that we were heading for such a situation. In addition, lending has been falling for years. Since April 2014, the situation has been improving, but at a worryingly slow pace. That’s another reason why we could not just sit back and say, things will get better by themselves. We have a mandate and should try to achieve that goal not only over a five-year cycle, but as soon as possible.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONAs far as I can remember, we have never been in a situation where things have turned negative so quickly.

A closely followed indicator is the “5y5y” rate, i.e. the markets’ expectations of the inflation rate in five years’ time for the five years thereafter. This rose at the start of QE, but only slightly. Are you disappointed? END_QUESTION\n\nWe are not 5y5y fetishists. We know the weaknesses of individual indicators. But what has worried me was the sagging that occurred under a certain limit. When it dropped to 1.4%, it was a free fall and there was a risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. At 1.7% to 1.8%, we are now back at a level of expectations that is more closely in line with our medium-term projections.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONWe are not 5y5y fetishists.

Sure, ultimately everything depends on the price. But it can’t be in your interest to pay excessive prices. END_QUESTION\n\nHigh prices inversely mean low interest rates – that is now precisely what we are aiming for. I don’t think there will be any shortage generally: many euro bonds have been issued and are available on the market because foreign investors have other regulatory requirements. In one segment or another there may be a shortage. Then we have to see how we handle it. Of course, the range of public offerings is defined very broadly and extends beyond central government. In any case, the programme is being constantly monitored.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONHigh prices inversely mean low interest rates – that is now precisely what we are aiming for.

END_QUESTION\n\nThis is certainly a theoretical possibility. But we must always ask ourselves whether an instrument is appropriate and proportionate. Such a cost/benefit analysis, to my mind, rules out that we are going down further with the deposit rate. We have also repeatedly said that we have reached the lower limit in respect of the interest rates. Please take a look at our most recently published “account”, the non-verbatim summary of the monetary policy discussion of the Governing Council members. \n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONThis is certainly a theoretical possibility.

END_QUESTION\n\n\nBEGIN_QUESTION With the launch of QE the euro has fallen in value once again. It has stabilised more recently. Are you pleased about that? When does a devaluation become a problem? END_QUESTION\n\nExchange rate developments are always dangerous when they are extreme and out of line with fundamentals. That still applies. For me, it’s time for the highest level of alarm when attempts are made to use the exchange rate as an instrument – and under the pretext of returning to stable prices, in order to improve competitiveness. That would deviate completely from our obligations, as laid down in the EU Treaty. That would be a red alert.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONExchange rate developments are always dangerous when they are extreme and out of line with fundamentals. That still applies.

END_QUESTION\n\nThere will always be atavistic reactions. But I do not want to overstate them. We at the ECB have no exchange rate target, and we don’t even use the exchange rate as an intermediate target. We are aware that it plays an important role in inflation. That’s all. Let me stress that it would be a mistake to regard the exchange rate as an instrument of general economic policy.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONThere will always be atavistic reactions.

The Federal Reserve has been finding out how difficult it is to exit and has been tapering its purchases. Does the ECB have to make some adjustments in that respect? END_QUESTION\n\nFirst of all, I'm very glad you asked me about the exit. Many others are only focusing on what else the ECB can do. We still have a lot of persuading to do. But of course you have a point, we absolutely have to avoid “cliff-edge” effects. The entire monetary policy is oriented towards smooth developments. So that’s a question which we will have to deal with when the time comes. But we are not yet at that point.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONFirst of all, I'm very glad you asked me about the exit.

Some are saying that price stability is actually 0% and that it is crazy for the ECB to use all ways and means to create inflation. END_QUESTION\n\nWe had a detailed discussion on this matter in the early 2000s under the ECB’s chief economist at the time, Otmar Issing. We quickly and unanimously concluded that we should not have an inflation target of 0%. In that scenario we would tend to be deflation-oriented, not least because of statistical distortions in measuring prices. An economy therefore needs a little inflation in order to have a buffer. I don’t think much at all of unsettling our definition of price stability – just as I don’t think much of questioning our strategy, as we have seen in the discussion on price-level targeting. \n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONWe had a detailed discussion on this matter in the early 2000s under the ECB’s chief economist at the time, Otmar Issing.

How painful is it for you to rubber-stamp the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greece’s banks in volumes of more than €70 billion? END_QUESTION\n\nFor ELA decisions we apply our rules strictly. This works both ways: I’d really feel the pain if we didn’t observe our rules. But of course we have to be careful that this step doesn’t lead to hidden monetary financing of governments.

Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann however goes one step further. He already sees a problem if Greek banks extend T-bills, i.e. perform a “rollover”. Is he right or is he too strict? END_QUESTION\n\nThe ECB’s Governing Council has not yet reached a conclusive opinion on that matter. For me, this is a dynamic process: the more a country – and a banking system – loses market access and the less likely it looks to regain it soon, the greater the risk of indirect monetary financing, and the stricter we have to be. Our response has been to observe the current situation very closely and promptly in order to prevent any circumvention of the ban on monetary financing. The supervisory arm also has a role to play here.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONThe ECB’s Governing Council has not yet reached a conclusive opinion on that matter.

END_QUESTION\n\nI would of course prefer to have no country in the [excessive] deficit procedure and debt reduction going faster. But compared with other regions in the world, we are not doing that badly. However we have to do much more to raise our growth potential. To that end, structural reforms are urgently needed. In that respect every country – and I stress every country – still has a lot to do. Some countries are still not tackling the issue of an ageing population. But I don’t believe that we have basically said goodbye to a stability union. We still have the corresponding body of regulations. I would also be pleased to see that being applied in a more targeted way.\n\nBEGIN_QUESTIONI would of course prefer to have no country in the [excessive] deficit procedure and debt reduction going faster.
