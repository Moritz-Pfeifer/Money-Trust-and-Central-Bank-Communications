LORENZO BINI SMAGHI, CHAIRMAN, SOCIETE GENERALE, IS INTERVIEWED ON BB TV JUNE 19, 2018 SPEAKERS: LORENZO BINI SMAGHI, CHAIRMAN, SOCIETE GENERALE MANUS CRANNY, BLOOMBERG NEWS ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG NEWS [*] ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Lots to talk about then, joining us now, the head of the future of Europe conference in Paris is the chairman of Societe Generale, the former executive board member of the ECB. Of course, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a real pleasure to speak to you. I know that you\u0027re involved in organizing the future of Europe conference. Yesterday then Lorenzo, we saw Macron and Merkel agreeing to set up a joint budget for the region. Is that something you would welcome? LORENZO BINI SMAGHI, CHAIRMAN, SOCIETE GENERALE: Well absolutely. I think Europe has been evolving and strengthening their reforms after the crisis. This is an important next step they\u0027ve been discussing for months, waiting first for the German government to liquidate them. And then the discussion between Macron and Merkel next week in the European Council will meet and, you know, set the final decision. That\u0027s a very important step. I think we have to realize that Europe is moving forward in spite of all of the challenges and environments coming from across the Atlantic and from Brexit. Europe is moving ahead. MANUS CRANNY, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Mr. Smaghi, very good day to you. It\u0027s Manus in Vienna. Let\u0027s take the discussion about the budget a little bit further forward. We understand that it\u0027s symbolic. I won\u0027t happen until 2021. But financial transaction tax is potentially one of the funding aspects of this. I mean, wouldn\u0027t that be like shooting oneself in the foot? Given the hope of the aspiration for Europe to win financial markets post-Brexit. SMAGHI: Well, we\u0027ll have to see the details. I don\u0027t think that the, you know, attacks in itself will be such as to go against the need for a continental Europe to build its own financial market. This was the case -- this would be it shooting into its own foot, I don\u0027t think that this is walk as a stake. I think we will have something much more symbolic and to some extent similar to what already released (ph) like a stamp tax in the U.K.. EDWARDS: They also, Macron and Merkel also agreed to increasing the role of the European stability mechanism, the ESM, Lorenzo. The questions about who will decide though when this backstop can be tapped. Do you think this is moving in the right direction for Europe? When should that be used? SMAGHI: Well, we know that one of the important elements of the European banking union was a fiscal backstop in case of a major crisis like in all countries. And ESM, this will be one of the main tasks in case of crisis. Then there are other issues to be discussed. The key element is how quickly, how effective this fund can be and this will depend on the decision making process. For instance, in my view, trying to avoid veto rights and decide quickly in case of a crisis. CRANNY: Lorenzo, what did you make of Mario Draghi\u0027s communication to the market last week? QE will end and rates will remain low and accommodative of three until the summer of next year. Was that a smart communication? Do you think that that\u0027s the right way to communicate with the market? SMAGHI: You know, if you go back and look at the way in which the Federal Reserve exited the QE, it\u0027s not that difference in the end. First, you communicate the date of the exit, then you tell the markets that you will pause for some time, waiting to look at the data, seeing whether they seem strong. And then start thinking about bringing back rates to normal. So, it seems to be very similar. And it went well in the case of the fed. And there are no reasons why it shouldn\u0027t go well for the ECB. The markets always ask, what\u0027s the next move? So they always try to get ahead. And so Draghi\u0027s attempt to calm things down I think was right thing to do. EDWARDS: I see across the Bloomberg just now, Lorenzo. Germany and France are calling for E.U. trade deals with emerging economies. Can the latest trade tensions between Trump and China, can they galvanize Europe, get Europe fall onto the same pace with regards to trade? How should Europe respond? SMAGHI: I mean Europe is the biggest and largest trade area. So it has to take its own responsibilities in the end. That was the big challenge after Trump\u0027s election, moving away from a multilateral trade deals. He wants to go to bilateral deals, fine. Europe will do the same. And since we are bigger, I think emerging markets and other countries will want to have good deals with Europe. I think that\u0027s the way that Europe will start moving. And maybe at the end, the U.S. will come back into multilateral trade table. CRANNY: Just to continue that theme that Anna has just mentioned, Germany and France calling for E.U. trade deals with emerging markets. Lorenzo, everybody is talking about Brexit, everybody is talking about the possibility of a no Brexit deal perhaps being put on the table next week. Is that really the vortex that we\u0027ve reached with these Brexit negotiations, these discussions? Do you think it\u0027s as bad as perhaps some of the press are making it out to be? SMAGHI: Well, I think the risk that we are facing is that everybody is saying, it\u0027s not reasonable not to have a deal. Everybody is going to be reasonable. We are confident that in the end things will happen. So there is like a -- a risk of a confidence bubble building up. While we will may find out that, you know, the last minute that there was no agreement and things may turn out to be much worse than we expected. And that\u0027s what we don\u0027t want in the financial markets. We want to have a clear agreement between the regulators, in particular, and between the authorities of the two sides. Just saying that there will be an agreement doesn\u0027t make it happen. So, we need things to be announced much earlier than just at the last minute, as the strategy seems to be. Just waiting for the last minute. EDWARDS: Lorenzo, a lot of the current drama seems to revolve around migration. Chancellor Merkel, of course, under pressure domestically because of the migration story. Do you think -- and this matters because of Eurozone cohesion. Can Germany and France get to the same place as Italy, Hungary, Austria on this net question of migration? SMAGHI: Migration is the big issue which is moving things in Europe. We are finally realizing that this is a major issue that is had an effect in Italy and some -- and Greece I will say. But it has an impact on the whole of Europe. And we need the European solution. So just saying, I close my borders, like the internal minister in Germany saying is not going to solve issues, it just going to create tension among countries. I think Merkel is right to say we need a European solution. We need to work for that and we need to find a compromise. And if we work together, then we\u0027ll find a solution which is acceptable for all. It\u0027s not going to be easy. It\u0027s not going to be easy. But I think the move between Macron and Merkel is a sign that things are moving in the right direction. CRANNY: Lorenzo, yes, it\u0027s no secret that you said, we are going to see big cross-border mergers. I can\u0027t let the chairman from Societe Generale disappear off of our TV screens without asking you. Look, what are the conditions? Are we nearly there yet in terms of the ability of regulators to tolerate of Franco-German or Franco-Italian- Bohamet (ph) deal? SMAGHI: In my view, I mean I won\u0027t comment on specific issues because, frankly, there is no point. But I think that the ball is in the hands of regulators. The regulators have said we need more integration and we have had less integration since the banking union has been realized has started. So, the ball is in their hands. They need to remove all of the regulatory obstacles for the creation of Pan-European banking rules. There are still rules, regulations obstacles at the national level, the European level. We need to complete the banking union. The agreements today if it is -- if it goes through, the DSM will be backstop for the single resolution from, is an important step forward. We also need to move towards a common European (INAUDIBLE) insurance that would be another major step So, if we move in that direction, I think the markets will take the opportunities to create these Pan-European banking groups that can compete at the same size, the same level and the same efficiency with the American banks, major banks. EDWARDS: OK. Lorenzo, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it. Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Chairman of Societe Generale.
